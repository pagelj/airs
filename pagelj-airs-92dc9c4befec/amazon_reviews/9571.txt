Works Fine
This screen protector went on pretty easily with no air bubbles, which is much appreciated. It's shiny and reflective; keep that in mind when you think about purchasing it. I like the shiny look, but others might prefer matte. Also, I imagine I will have to replace the screen protector every couple of months or more because the edges are going to get battered and start to peel up, but that's largely my own fault because I don't have a bulky case on the phone and I put it into and pull it out of my pockets very frequently.
