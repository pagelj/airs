I've owned this vacuum now for two months now and bought it because I own two long haired dogs. The vacuum sucks up the pet hair great on carpet. I'm finding it doesn't do well on the bare floors which was a feature that interested me when I bought it. The pet tools are not spectacular so I use just the hose mostly. The hose is really short almost impossible to use. The quick release vacuum container gets dirt stuck in it so is hard to close unless it's clean. Also pretty hair stays up in the funnel unless I shake it or stick my fingers in to pull it out. I think if I had to buy it again I wouldn't and would try another brand.
