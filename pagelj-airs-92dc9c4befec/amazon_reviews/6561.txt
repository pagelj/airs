Very lacking in ever detail
This story is so lacking in every aspect of the story. I mean... here's a guy who proclaims to never find himself in a relationship ever again until he takes out one of the company's accountants, and within a few short weeks is asking her to move in with him. What??? Then he chooses to believe an old girlfriend, rather than believe the one person he proclaims to love? Nothing about this story felt right, at least not to me. And I couldn't believe that she forgave him within the first two minutes after he walked back into her apartment. Does she have no pride? I don't know about any of you... but if someone talked to me like he'd done to her, he'd be begging and groveling for months, if not years. Would I recommend this book? No, absolutely not!
