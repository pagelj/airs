Good book...
This book was good. I thought the author did well balancing out the major and minor details. Splendid pacing. By the end of the book, I wasn't feeling abandoned with an awful cliffhanger, but interested enough to want to continue. I would recommend this book to anyone,  and besides, who doesn't enjoy a little forbidden love? :)
