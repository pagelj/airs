High Capacity in a Small Package
New Trent's iCarrier 12000mAh battery pack is simple, effective, and POWERFUL.  The battery pack takes up very little space in my iPad bag.  I carry a number of mobile accessories every time I travel.  With each trip I take an iPhone, iPad, bluetooth speaker, bluetooth headset, bluetooth headphones, and charging cables.  The problem I run into, is a lack of access to charging locations.  With the iCarrier, I can charge my iPhone many times over or charge my iPad, as well as all of my other bluetooth devices.  The battery capacity of this product is excellent - especially considering the minimal weight and size.  I prefer the matte finish New Trent went with, as fingerprints and scratches are not as noticeable.  I appreciate the simplicity of the product in that it provides standard usb outlets.  By going with a standard usb socket, the consumer gets to choose what cable or device to use.  I previously owned Mophie cases.  While their capacity was good, I was stuck with Apple's 30 pin connector.  When the case battery was dead, I had to carry around a heavy dead battery.  The iCarrier allows me to use mini usb, Apple's legacy 30 pin, and new Lightning connector cables.  Honestly, the name iCarrier does not do the product justice.  It leads one to believe it is designed strictly for an Apple mobile device.  To the contrary, any device that can charge from a standard usb socket will work fine with this device.  The two ports are labeled for 1 or 2 amp service.  This allows for charging smart phones and tablets on the go.  The only negative I have for this product is the indicator LED.  While I like the blue color, it is very bright.  During daylight hours this is not an issue, but in a dark bedroom or car, it is somewhat annoying.  When charging, the unit will blink.  I recommend charging the unit out of sight to avoid dealing with this.  In my opinion, you will not find a better product for the price.
