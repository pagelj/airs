kindle malfunction!
Im unsure of what chapter i am on, but my kindle fire tells me im 53% through the book. Anyway my kindle continues to freeze time and time again no matter what i try. Things i have tried are as follows, restarting said kindle, deleting the book and redownloading it, attempting to quickly jump to the beginning of the book in the hopes that i can avoid the error message. It just tells me that amazon is not responding wherein giving me two choices, "force close" or "wait" im getting frustrated. however, so far riordan has not disappointed. the book is as entertaining as those preceding it. from what ive read from other reviews others are experiencing these same issues. i also would like to point out that i havent had an experience like this with any of my other kindle purchases, so this is pretty weird.
