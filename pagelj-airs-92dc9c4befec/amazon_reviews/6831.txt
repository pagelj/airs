Works like a charm
This is exactly what I needed for a link between my TV and Receiver.  I notice a few reviews say that it "does not click in."  Just a pointer, the plastic ends that are attached to the end of each side of the cable need removed first - they are there to keep debris out of the connector. Cheap and gets the job done.
