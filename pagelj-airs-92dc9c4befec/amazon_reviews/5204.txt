Not impressed
I had this inverter installed in my cargo van and just after a year it started giving me problems.  I use it to mainly run an 800 watt microwave, laptop, and GPS.  The inverter worked well then began to experience power loss.  The unit remains on, but does does not give any continuous power output.  Sometimes, the power output cycles on and off while still showing it is on at the switch. It is connected to a seperate high output battery of very good quality. I use it frequently, about 9 months out of the year.  After 2 years now, I am still having problems with it. It is becoming frustrating not knowing if it will work or not.  I haven't figured out any reason for it to act up.  I am now looking for a new inverter.  Maybe I just got a lemon. I expected more from a respectable name such as Tripp Lite.
