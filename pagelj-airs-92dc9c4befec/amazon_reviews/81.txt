writer boxed hmself in
The many good reviews convinced me to read this book and I'm not sorry, but by the end of the book I was frustrated. Unlike some reviewers, I thought the first half of the book was wonderful.  Jacob's struggles to make sense of his Grandfather's life, the stories he had been told and how that related to his own life were deeply moving and well told.  The descriptions of the island and his first visit to the house were evocative and haunting.  Once he discovered the children, though, I thought the story began to break down. I love a good fantasy but the author has to make me feel that it's true, which Riggs didn't accomplish for me. Even with the photographs, many of the children felt forced as though Riggs was trying to hard to make up a story about the photographs.  He boxed himself in with his own story too.  It was obvious from somewhere just past the middle of the book that there was not going to be a good ending.  Stories with bad endings have a place but in the later parts of the book, Riggs rushed through the adventures of the characters with not enough attention to the emotional side of the story.  He didn't give you a place to cry.  An ending that terrible should have made you cry. I had bought this book as a gift, but have changed my mind.  I didn't dislike it enough to feel that I wasted my time.  In fact I enjoyed it many ways and will remember it, but it's not good enough for the implied recommendation of giving as a gift.
