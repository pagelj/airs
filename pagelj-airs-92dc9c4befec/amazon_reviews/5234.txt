Nice budget filter
I bought this filter with the Canon 50mm 1.8 II, and it is a perfect filter for it.  I've been shooting in cold weather with it and it has never fogged up and resists dust buildup well.  It is a perfectly priced filter for a budget consumer lens like the 50mm.  It is threaded on both sides to facilitate filter stacking or lens hoods.
