Doesn't work. Don't waste your time
I thought I was purchasing the "Easy" way to convert our wedding video to DVD.  The product doesn't work. The first box I received didn't show any video and the audio was choppy.  The second showed out of sync frames with choppy audio although better than the first one.  I will say their tech support were courteous and easy to get a hold of, but the device itself appears to be junk.  I had the NW06 model which apparently others have had issues with also.
