Great backpack
Excellent bag with lots of separate compartments so items can be put away where you know where to find them when travelling. The Scansmart works great and makes going through TSA screening so much easier. Exceptional bag for the price paid and seems to be well made too. It will be interesting how it fares after 3 or 4 trips but after first trip to UK and France I am impressed.
