Great case, not so great for pics with flash
I bought this one, and another in a different color from another seller. Both arrived at the same time. It is a great case, it is sturdy, and feels very durable. Has a rubber-like feel to it when you touch it. However, when I try to use the flash on a picture, it turns the picture a bright pink. Weird. Without the case the flash works fine. If you don't use flash very often, this would be great for you, but if you prefer flash, you may want to consider taking it off for those pics. Or, enjoy the bright pink pic! You can still see the picture, its just pink. lol
