Pay for What you Get
Pros: Price. Sharp blades. Cons: Lightweight (feel cheap). Poorly constructed handles - 2 knives arrived with cracked handles and a third cracked after the first use. Yes, Amazon has a great return policy, but for a $25 purchase I don't want to deal with the hassle. With a brand name like Ginsu I expect to receive a quality product the first time. Ginsu also has a warranty on the knives, but at $3/knife for the return service it hardly seems worth it.
