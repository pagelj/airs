Stay away- TERRIBLE laptop
Acer is notorious for being on the lower end of the price range. There is a GOOD reason for that. I currently own Aspire 5742-6811, and my personal experience with Aspire is terrible. Your laptop will likely hold just fine for roughly 6 months, but it goes downhill from there.1. Common overheating problem- if you regularly use any programs that is at least moderately demanding, I suggest backing off of Acer, especially the Aspire model. The internal fan might as well not exist. If you must buy this laptop, it's imperative that you buy a TOP END fan. I suggest Coolmaster.2. Deteriorating Performance- as time goes on, your laptop will naturally decline in performance due to all the junk we put in there, but Aspires respond especially badly to age. Within a year, you can expect your laptop to significantly slow down after using a moderately demanding program for at least 5 minutes.3. Cheap sound system- most Acers, including the Aspire line, have terrible sound quality. If you have and will always use a headset, this one does not apply to you. For anyone who ever plans to use the laptop's speakers, be warned: the laptop's max volume is a fraction of its competitors at similar price ranges. Competitors have adopted more advanced sound systems that will allow you to hear sound well from about 10 feet away, but not Acer. Max volume will be comparable to a volume setting of 7 in the average vehicle.
