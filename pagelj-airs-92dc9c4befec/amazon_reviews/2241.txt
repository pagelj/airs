Can't go wrong multiple output inverter and charger
I've used inverters for many years, and find corded version, more versatile.  I had several compact models such as BESTEK 150W 3.1A USB Ipad charger power inverter car dc 12v 110v car adapter usb charger car samsung adapter pda car charger htc tablet charger mp3 car adapter iphone charger car ipad adapter charger blackberry car adapter laptop charger 1511C and the biggest problem is they can be so bulky that they interfere with the gear shifter on dashboard 12V sockets or a tight squeeze in consoles 12V sockets.  Many of them get warm to hot at full load, and in my experience, if they end up hot, it shortens their lifespan, and sure enough my old inverter died too. This device is about the size of a box of playing cards.  The fan makes a very faint whine that is inaudible when a car is in motion, and the LED is bright enough to see in daylight.  Its fairly easy to locate because its cabled, and keeping it out of consoles allows it to breath and stay cool, it always seems to run cool.  When plugged into a dashboard socket, it doesn't interfere with the shifter. ProsProvides its rated power without problems, both as 120V and 12VCorded versatility, easy to relocate to best positionQuietSmall & Compact; easily to storeUSB port allows me to use any good cable, be it mini or micro USB say for GPS or cell phone respectivelyConsDoesn't come with USB cablesShould come with a small bag to hold all the parts togetherThis low cost charger is a modified sine wave inverter, similar to many inverters in this class.  It works for most devices, but can give problems powering 2-way radios or audio amplifiers because of the electrical noise this technology creates, and is expected.  Its fine for wall warts, electric motors, chargers, but not everything.
