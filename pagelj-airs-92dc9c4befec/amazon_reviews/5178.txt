Great pictures and enables creativity
This camera was a great buy.  I have known what model I wanted for over six months.  I found a refurbished one listed as "like new" condition.  Well the condition was absolutely true; not even a single scratch on the body, screen, or lens! The auto focus option really takes guessing out of what setting to use. But, it's flexible enough I can manually focus if I am going for a particular visual affect.  My son and I had a great time playing with the sports shots.  It fires out about 20 action pictures so quickly, and quietly we didn't know it captured anything the first time, but the pictures were wonderful.  This Nikon camera gives us lots of options for shooting great pictures and playing with creativity. It was a great investment for my family.
