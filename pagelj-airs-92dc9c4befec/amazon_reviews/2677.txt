Great cable, you should save money too.
From 2000 to 2002, I was top seller in a higher end television and stereo store, much like Tweet Etc. Actually, it was later acquired by Tweeter Etc before going out of business.... I became top seller not by pushing products on my customers, but by being honest with them and giving great discounts. I never pushed cables or extended warranties, as these products are very expensive and provider very little ongoing value. Trust is instrument for generating repeat business. These cables are cheap, and the work adequately. I've connected them to my home theater system, which cost more than $7,000.00, and I'm quite pleased with the results. Their construction is on par with typical USB cables you might find a the computer store. Their fit is quite snug, and I own four of them. Since these cables transmit a digital signal, I don't think you need to fret over high cost alternatives..... I highly recommend them!
