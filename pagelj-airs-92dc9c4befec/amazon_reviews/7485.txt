Yes
I don't know if you noticed but this thing is only a few bucks. It's an excellent choice! We used it for basic tv-peripheral hookup, and it works exactly as you would expect it to. I'm not a techie so maybe I'm missing something, but I really don't understand why you'd spend more. Happy and recommended.
