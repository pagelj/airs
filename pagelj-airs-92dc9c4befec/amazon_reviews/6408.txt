Purchased in April.  Turned pot on this morning and nothing.  Appears to be the heating element.  Coffee maker is a litlle over three month used and has been cleaned with vinegar on a monthly bases. Purchased from Amazon, contacted them and they are graciously sending a replacement.  Will see how the replacement functions.  As of now I would say purchase with caution.
