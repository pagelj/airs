My was not that good
Was really disappointed with this product from this seller could have just been my that was Defective or that's the Way he sells them all. First of all the USB power wall charger Was broken or defective because The sync data cable that goes into it would not fully go inside so it would not stay together. Then I thought it was the cable side of it but I use my old power wall charger and it work fine so there was something Definitely wrong with it. Then the cable side that goes into the Device was really hard to click into place and take off to only from one side. I try it with multiple devices iPhones and iPods it does the same with all of them. Then again you get what you paid for
