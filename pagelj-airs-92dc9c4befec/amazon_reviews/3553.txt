Not bad
The bag is ok for the price. This would work for small to medium camera body. I am using the d3100 kit lens as of now, I hope a 18-200mm nikon lens would also fit in. The bag is light weight, keeps the camera suspended in air by the latch. The shoulder strap is crap, does not give much of a confidence, would have to be replaced with a more solid strap.
