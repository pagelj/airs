Great Camera for the price
We bought this for my tween daughter over christmas and she loves it. She takes it everywhere. It is so easy for her to take pictures and transfer them to her PC and work with them. She is emulating her mom who is a photographer, so it has been great to see her using her camera so much. I would highly recommend this for any kids or even grown ups who want to explore taking pictures and get more into photography.
