Great product at a great price
This keyboard stand rocks! The hard case is perfect for protecting my tablet from my clumsiness, and the keyboard is fully functional. I don't suggest using the stylus that comes with it, as it's got a hard tip and may scratch up your screen even through a screen protector. Overall, I love this hook up and I'm glad I got it.
