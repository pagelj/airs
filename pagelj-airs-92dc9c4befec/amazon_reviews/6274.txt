Not love at first hear, takes a few listens to fully appreciate
I originally bought it because the three singles that came off of it were so good, and I already had their new cd and loved it. At first I wasn't that impressed, but it grew on me. Probably doesn't hurt that I've seen them in concert twice since I bought it, and they played a lot of songs off this at their concerts.
