Great Beginner Camera
This is a great camera. My wife who is not the most tech savvy loves the camera. It is easy to use and gives great results. My wife went through the instructions and feels very confident that she is ready to take pictures and is excited about moving to the "next" level in photography. The only complaint I had is the Amazon advertisement is misleading. It says that if you buy the camera you get a 32 GB card free. I did and it did not come.. I went back and you have to read the  instructions very carefully. You must select the options of the card plus the bag and then when you go through check out it is supposed to credit you the price of the card. I had to order a card today as it did not come with any card. It was my mistake, but it is not clear, and might just be deceptive... I thought I read the ad carefully, but alas I did not...
