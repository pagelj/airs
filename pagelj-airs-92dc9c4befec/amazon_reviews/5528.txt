Fun, unusual plus heartwarming
GOOD.  I always rate a novel based on the character development more than the story line and this excelled.  I found this novel by searching for "christian romance comedy" and although the "christian" WAS sparse it was truly a clean story.  I wish the ending chapters had more background before ending.
