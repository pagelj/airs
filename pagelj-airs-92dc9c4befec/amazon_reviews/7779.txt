Seems OK but didn't work for my problem.
I think this product probably does (most of) what it claims to do, but unfortunately it didn't fix my DVD player.  My DVD player has intermittent and inconsistent problems reading/recognizing DVDs (brand new DVDs, library DVDs, computer-written DVDs, all types).  Sometimes it reads them and works fine, and sometimes it ejects the disc and refuses to read it. Hoping that it was just a dirty lens and considering the reviews, I tried this product.  The product disk has a number of tufts of fiber designed (I think) to clean the laser lens.  It didn't work but didn't do any harm either.  My player might have some other problem, then.  I'll save this drive cleaner in case I ever need it for a computer drive.
