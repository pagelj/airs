Purchased for use with PS3, can't seem to get it to work
This product is a good product.  Responds quickly when plugged into a laptop, and can store a great deal of items on it.  My only problem is that it will not function with my PS3.  I have reformatted it to FAT32, and created folders like everyone says to, but when I plug it into my PS3 I get zip, nada, zilch.  The light comes on the hard drive when I plug it into the USB port on the PS3, so I know that it is getting enough power to it, but nothing happens once plugged in.  I can then replug it into my laptop and it still shows all of the data there.  Is there anything in particular that I am forgetting to do?  I have reformatted it numerous times and each time I get the same result.  Someone please help.  Thanks.
