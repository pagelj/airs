I was super excited when I got this on the counter. Unfortunately, it didn't work. The process for pulling hot water through the machine wasn't working. Everything seemed to be on and heating up, but this one flaw is a show stopper. The mechanics of this machine may explain the extreme discount btw. The electronics and heat/water drip system are all on one switch and dependent upon everything working. The steam controller is directly above the steamer which makes it awfully hot when steaming. Easy return!
