Breakers
I liked the Breakers for the most part. I liked the action, but I found myself skiping pages that I paid for, but found not to my interest,Walt lost Venessa,greiving is ok but don;t keep relieving it. Ranan lost Kia, he grieved and went on.  More than anything Please Don't Have Your Charters use Gods Name Invane. I am begining to lose interest because of the language. I deal with people that use rough language, but respect me and not use it with me.. Thank You, Edward W. Robertson. TJKJ
