It's a good case but not exactly what I needed
There's nothing wrong with this case. It has a lot of room to carry a few other things in it (assuming you're using a small camera). The only thing that I had a problem with was it's softness. That's nice for putting stuff in, but having bought a very small camera (small Sony Cybershot) that I wanted to carry on my belt all the time, I wanted something that would offer protection too. Sony LCS-THG Cybershot T-series Soft Leather Carrying Case I found this case to be much more supportive and protective for my camera. Of course, the flip side is it's much smaller with no room for other items (batteries, Memory Sticks, etc.) I was willing to trade in the space for size and protection. I carry the battery and memory stick in a case in my pocket. Anyway, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this case. It just didn't fit the bill for what I needed.
