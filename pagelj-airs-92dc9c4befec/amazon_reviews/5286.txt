Be warned
I have no idea how this thing actually performs because I reached the point where it required credit card information just to set up an account and unplugged the thing and threw it in the trash.  I should have read the reviews closer before purchasing it.  A credit card, really?  You think I'm going to give my cc information out willy-nilly?  Screw you, Roku.  The one I bought as a gift also went into the trash.
