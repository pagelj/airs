Does what it is supposed to do.
This works.  It charges the battery that I ordered for my 16-year-olds phone.  Since that's what it's supposed to do, great!  It's a little light, and I wonder how long it will last, but for now it's great.  Not 5 stars because there aren't very explicit instructions on setting up the charger, but it's kinda obvious when you look at it.  Unfortunately, there are some who need to read the instructions on toothpicks, so...... Update:I was contacted by the company and sent a set of instructions for the charger. Very polite and easy to work with.  My daughter loves the charger btw.  She broke the charging port on her phone, which is how this all started.  Good company and good product!
