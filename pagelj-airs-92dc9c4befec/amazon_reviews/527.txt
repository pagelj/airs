Mixed emotions about this book
I'm a HUGE fan of Ms Banks' books.  I absolutely love her style, her characters, her plots, the topcis she writes about, ALL of it. Sadly, this book is the exception.  Don't get me wrong, her style is there, the way she develops the characters is there & the way the plot develops is kinda, sorta ok, not good. My big issues are the way Gabe handles Mia, emotionally & physically.  He is such a jerk & Mia is such a fool for putting up with ALL of it the way she does.  I was expecting a much stronger Mia WAY earlier in the book, not almost at the end. Also, I was expecting Gabe to go thru WAY more to get Mia back at the end, not happy about the ease in which he wins her back. Last but not least, the whole sex topic is quite strong, which I don't mind, I know it's out there, people like different styles, that's fine with me, but there are 2 scenes that have a lot to do with my 2-star rating. The one I absolutely hate is the one where Gabe even admits "raping" her mouth.  HATE IT.  The other one is the scene in Paris, which i just don't like. I won't let one book ruin this series for me, I'l give it a try one more time & read Fever, which I hope is better than Rush.
