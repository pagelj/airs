Great read!!!
In a dangerous world where "tributes" are carted away to meet a mysterious, but assuredly sinister, fate a young girl name Shann comes of age. Shann lives the planet Kelanni, a repressive planet with a rigid caste system. She becomes embroiled in a plot to overthrow the government after helping out a rebel she comes across by chance (or perhaps fate). This is a fast-paced and exciting read. This novel, and the whole series, are a must-have for fans of indie science fiction and fantasy. Whiteway adroitly crafts endearing characters you just can't help but cheer for. However, this is no mere character piece Like all great pieces of science fiction and fantasy, this genre-bending novel followers characters who are but players in a larger, more complex world. They reader may only catch glimpses, but it is clear that entire planet of Kelanni (with a unique culture, history, literature, and technologies) is there, waiting to be discovered through the conduit of the plot. I highly recommend this enjoyable and fascinating read. It is great fun and will leave you hungry for more. A definite page turner.
