Excellent HDMI cable
After reading the reviews for HDMI cables with Ethernet capability, I selected the Mediabridge cable.  I've been very happy with the cable, which does a great job of transmitting both audio and video.  And, the cable is both tought and flexible, which made it easy to pull through the wall to my TV. Overall I'm very pleased with this cable.  High quality at a fair price - doesn't get better than that.
