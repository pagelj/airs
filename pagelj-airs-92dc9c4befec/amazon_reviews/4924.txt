Awesome lens!
I had been looking for a zoom lens that would fit my budget. And after reading the reviews of this lens, I went in for the plunge. And this is an awesome lens! Sure, you will need a tripod when you zoom in at 300, but almost every shot I've taken that was below 300 came out great. One thing I didn't realize was how long the lens gets when you zoom, but it doesn't really bother me. It does what I want it to do and gets in close where I want it to be close....
