Not a Bad Toaster for the Buck
Have been using this toaster for about a week now.  For the most part I really like it.  My toast comes out nice and even and I really appreciate the countdown timer in the display window.  Have not used the "reheat" function, but have toasted a few bagels and it works just as well as toasting bread.  Very easy appliance to keep clean and I certainly appreciate the removable crumb tray.  Despite the Black & Decker warning to not put the tray through your dishwasher I did and it cleaned up very nicely.  Just be sure to turn off the "HEATED DRYING" option on the dishwasher.  The one thing I did not like is the retractable power cord feature.  I pulled numerous time on the cord trying to get the locking system to hold the cord in place but it kept retracting the cord into the toaster as it simply would not lock.  I finally smashed on the "retract" button a number of times and the internal cog finally locked the cord into my desired length.  This is the only reason that I did not give this appliance a 5 Star rating.  Overall construction is quite good even though this toaster has a very prominent "Made in China" sticker on the bottom.  If you are looking for a much better than average toaster for a fair price, this appliance will work well for you.  I just hope you have better luck with the power cord retraction mechanism than I did!
