I did a good hour of research and read all the reviews out there. I was leaning towards the Dyson but read so many negative reviews about them being overpriced and a pain in the butt to clean. I decided on this Hoover and I was pleasantly surprised. It's very powerful and even better, it's quiet in comparison to every other vacuum I've owned. I have a toddler who is scared of everything and even she was unphased by the low hum of this vacuum. I love the extra long cord.  I can literally vacuum the entire second story of my home without unplugging and moving to another outlet. The canister unit is nice, light and has a wand attachment that extends to you can reach ceiling fans, corners, baseboards, etc. What a deal. So far, I'm pleased as I can be. I'm so glad I didn't spend twice as much for the Dyson.
