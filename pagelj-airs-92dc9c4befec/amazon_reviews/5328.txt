Sweet!
As always on Amazon. com I came across this neat little itemwith MUCH doubt due to all the negative reviews. but i figured"its cheap, its free shipping.. WHY NOT" ? So i took a chance and it paid off. I paid less than $2 for something that Apple charges an arm and a leg for! The look and feel of the product isgreat! its exactly like an apple adapter. I have an original Apple product that i compared it to and i can honestly tell absolutely NO DIFFERENCE! I would definitely recommend this neat little item to Anyone looking for a good quality, cheap alternative to apple's adapter. Cant beat it for the price! Have at it!
