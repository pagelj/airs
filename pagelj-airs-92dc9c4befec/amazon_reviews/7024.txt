Bought two of these for Samsung phones.  They work fine.
I purchased two of these for Samsung Galaxy S and S3 android phones.  I recently upgraded my old phone to the S3, but rather than recycle the old one, I turned it into a 32GB Wifi MP3 player for my kid. The other card went into my newer model phone.  Both were instantly recognized by the phones, and they seem to be working well.  No reformatting was needed.
