Great all use lens
I recently purchased this lens for use on my Canon 20D.  I was never happy with the lens that came with the camera.  I've been very happy with this lens. Pros:- Quality construction. The lens doesn't feel cheap.- Zoom range of this lens is fantastic.- Image quality is great.- Internal focusing makes using filters and hoods a piece of cake- Zoom lock is nice so the zoom ring doesn't turn while stored or carried.- Price.  For the money this lens will give you a lot of bang for the buck. Con:- Auto focusing is a bit slow for a moving subject.
