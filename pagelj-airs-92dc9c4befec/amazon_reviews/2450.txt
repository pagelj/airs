great!
You can't beat it for the price. The macro turned out good color and clarity, hwever, you do need a steady hand without a tripod. I am very satisfied with the lens and it's performance. For the money, it's a must for Macro fans. The telephoto surprisingly gets as close to distant objects without losing too much deyail and color. A must for amature to Semi- Pro enthusiasts.
