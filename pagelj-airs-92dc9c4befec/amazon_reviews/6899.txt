Great Protection
Have had the case for approx one week. Had a problem with a Defender for an HTC Vivid not being responsive enough at the edges for the screen, but it works like a charm on my Fire.  I have noticed it getting a touch warm, but with two layers of protection I'm not surprised.  If you want maximum protection look no further. Did have a problem with the smallest tabs breaking on the HTC Vivid Defender case, so you might not want to take it out to often. Edit:After approx 4 months with the case, the little side tabs are starting to show significant bending.  Sometimes at sides of my Fire Gen 2 screen I need to press multiple times for the fire to take the command.  If you ever have to take the case off more than once a month I would not recommend the product.  If you never take it out of the case, you might be okay as the protection is outstanding.  Can't say the same for the design as we've had the same style of product break in the same area.
