Has some problems
The picture quality for Blu-ray and DVD is very good, and the boot time is excellent.  However, in just a few uses the machine has shown a tendency to lock up and the only way to resolve the issue is to pull the power cord.  This has happened while viewing movies, and looking at photos that are stored on my PC. The Netflix quality is poor.  I also have a Roku box that I use for Netflix, and the quality for the Roku far exceeds that of the Panasonic Blu-ray player.  Since the quality on the Roku is so much better I don't consider the Blu-ray player as even being an option if I want to watch anything through Netflix. All things considered it is not a bad Blu-ray player, but the tendency to freeze up makes this a machine that I probably would not recommend.
