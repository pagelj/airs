Disabled my channels by signing an exclusive deal with Dish
I would advice buyers to avoid buying Roku for the following reasons:1. YouTube is not available on Roku  and it does not look like thats going to change.2. Roku is not an open platform, it can deactivate channels you are using based on their whims.  Roku recently disabled YuppTV as they made an exclusive deal with Dishworld.  Dishworld is a far inferior service with channels not available in all languages.3. There is no easy way to connect your computer to the device and stream from it. Its safer to use a more open platform where you are sure that the channels you have are not turned off one morning.
