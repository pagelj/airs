Stop working suddenly!
I purchased this item a little over a month ago.  I needed an additional charger for use at work.  Needless to say, it is probably too late to return in now but the charger no longer works.  It is never moved and the cord has not be compromised.  It just stopped working.  My old cord, which has wires sticking out still works.  Have not contacted the seller because Im sure its too late to return and not worth the hassle
