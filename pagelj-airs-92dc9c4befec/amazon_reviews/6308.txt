THIS CASE IS AWESOME!
I've had this case for a week and have gotten countless compliments on it! I put my IDs and debit card and cash in the wallet side and the phone case hold my phone snugly. The magnetic closure doesn't pop open even when I've got a wad of cash stuck in there!  My phone charger and auxillary cable/headphones still fit in the holes fine without having to pop the case off! It's awesome!
