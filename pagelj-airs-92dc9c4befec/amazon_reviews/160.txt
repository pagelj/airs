you get what you pay for
There are several problems with this remote training collar.  I ordered this and received it quickly and followed the directions for setup on youtube with no problems.  Then..... after only using it for a few days it stopped working.  I shipped it back and the seller sent us a new one.  The second one lasted for about 2 weeks and guess what - it has also stopped working.  We've checked the batteries/functionality in both the collar and the receiver and they are both working.  The batteries for remote are 6v which are VERY expensive (about $10 where we live and you need 2 of them).  The remote also only stays active for about 20-30 seconds and then goes to "sleep" to supposedly save the batteries.  Therefore when a dog is exhibiting an undesired behavior, you have to bring the remote to life by holding the button down for 5 seconds and then you're able to deliver the vibration or stimulation.  That is very ineffective as a behavior needs to be stopped immediately to have lasting effects.  Bottom line - spend your money elsewhere.
