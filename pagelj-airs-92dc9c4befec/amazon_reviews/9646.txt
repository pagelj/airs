Works but lacks good usage instructions
Purchased this camera as a surveillance device for my car. It works and I was able to download video into my Mac via its USB port. A battery is provided but you have to buy a SD memory card. The only ways to charge the battery are by plugging it into your car's cigarette lighter or though (very slowly) the USB connection. The documentation needs improvement. You will need a magnifying glass. I soon found a far better video solution -- mounting my iPhone with a suitable suction cup mount and installing the Witness app. A small aside. If you go with the iPhone solution, I found it overheating and rebooting when subjected to a sunny hot day. The solution was to blow air through my defrost vents. In regards to this purchase, it was not a total loss. I used the SD card in one of my digital cameras.
