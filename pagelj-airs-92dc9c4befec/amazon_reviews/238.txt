really gripping story
I have been in a reading slump the past few months, finding nothing to catch my interest enough to keep reading. Ender's Game is different. It is a little fantastic at times (it IS sci-fi/fantasy, though), but it is really engaging and fast paced. I am definitely going to pick up the next one in the series!
