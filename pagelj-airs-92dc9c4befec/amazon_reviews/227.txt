This wireless IP camera works straight out of the box. Setup is easy and all the features are great. Wireless feature & price were the top choices that made me purchase this model & brand. Rated as indoor camera, mine is installed outside on the porch tucked in under the door sill out of the heavy weather & wind. I wish that comes with wider lens.
