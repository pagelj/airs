Lumix SZ7 Panasonic camera.
The camera arrived in the time frame stated.  The contents were as described; however, the box was slightly deformed as it was in a cushioned pastic bag rather than double boxed. The camera has a Leica zoom lens that has fantastic resolution.  Although it is advertized as 10X optical, by selection a lower MP from the menu, the 10X on my camera exceeds the 4.5-45 range.  My guess would be the equivalent of a 25mm to 400mm range.  I have mine set to 3MP which has worked out well. It fits into a shirt pocket and is a far cry from the past which would have required a set of heavy lenses to carry around. I am well pleased with Amazon's service.
