I wasn't going to leave a review since there were already so many terrific reviews but I've been using this for a while and cleaning around the litter box is no light task.  This vacuum continues to perform like wonders.  Yes it is top heavy.  You won't care.  It is such a breeze to empty.  I even wash the canister now and then to keep it nice. I love the way you can adjust it to go over long shag rugs.  No more lousy hoovers from Sears.  One thing you need to know.  If you do notice that it is loosing suction, take off the very bottom hose.  chances are it is clogged.  Mine had stopped sucking and by doing this, I discovered I had a tiny plastic bag stuck down there.
