Functional and efficient
I purchased this memory card to replace a similar card that had been used for several years and was beginning to exhibit signs of data instability.  While xD cards may not be the 'flavor of the moment' or have gained as wide a user base as some other card types, they still are a much-needed commodity for the many users of FujiFilm and Olympus camera models.  Based on my experience with the prior card, I look forward to many years of trouble-free use.
