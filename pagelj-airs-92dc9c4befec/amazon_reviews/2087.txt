Good
The computer is good. The only issue I have is with the the mouse pad. This is VERY sensitive. It sometimes does not let me click things or will click things if my finger is on the thing! It is frustrating if I am in the middle of something or trying to click something out. Also the speakers are not very loud but I was expecting that with the other reviews. Other than that the computer is awesome!
