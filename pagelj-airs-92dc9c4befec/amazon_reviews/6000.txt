Satisfied, but disappointed.
When I spent almost $70 on this backpack, I expected Hermes' to be jealous. However, in large, I am disappointed. I will keep to the absolutes of the bag in this review.-The straps are positioned on the bag in a VERY non-optimal way. The weight distribution is off, and makes what you're carrying feel much heavier. I'm not just a whiny brat, this is an actual problem with the bag, and the problem that's contributed the most towards it being a disappointment. However, it is comfortable, for being so poorly designed.-The available space inside is misleading from how HUGE it is. I'm a gangly 6 foot teenager, and it looks like I'm wearing a tortoise shell. That would normally be fine if I could fit more than my laptop and two binders in it. I try for a textbook, and it starts moaning.-The quality seems good where it counts-- the straps and handles and zippers. However, the little things have apparently been neglected. There's a mesh bag hanging in the laptop compartment, meant for little things. The velcro on the strap that wraps over the laptop has damaged the mesh material so bad there's holes in it. Thank goodness it's too small to really hold anything.-Speaking of too small to hold everything, that's how most of the compartments feel.*HOWEVER, I bought this bag to keep my $1000 laptop safe. It does just that. I would feel comfortable with it falling 6 feet onto concrete, with it landing any which way. I suppose the protective components is what takes up so much room. So, I'm satisfied.
