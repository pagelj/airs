Makes it easy to type at night. But not full 17".
I compared a bunch of USB LED lights after seeing one at Five Below for $5. I thought, "Hey, neat idea. Now I won't have to hunt for keys at night." But I figured I should come to Amazon and check out the other options. I thought more LEDs might be good, but they also seem to be top-heavy. After reading the reviews I settled on this as a good compromise between brightness, length, and the ability of the gooseneck to support the light. First, I measured this. It says 17" in the description. It's actually just over 16"--maybe 16 and 1/4. And that is from the very tip of the USB plug to the very tip of the light. The USB plug itself is about 2" of rigid, unbendable, unusable length. About 1" to 1.5" more is lost in the curve from the USB up to a full 90 degrees. Same goes at top bending to the light. And finally the light is 3". That means you only really get about 8" to 9" of height above your keyboard if you want the light to be strictly horizontal. If you're ok with it at an angle or even vertical, you can get more clearance. The main problem with the clearance is not your hands, but your eyes--with a laptop, you are usually looking down, which means this light will obstruct your view of the screen if you use it in a purely horizontal orientation. But adjusting it to about 45 degrees gets it out of my line of site for most purposes but still lights the keyboard well. The gooseneck seems to work pretty well, too, and is thin enough that the light isn't extremely top heavy. The USB jack seems to be enough to support it, though because of the weight it has to support, it leans a bit more than a USB flash drive or other smaller device would. So, it's good enough for me. Just be aware this isn't as long as it sounds.
