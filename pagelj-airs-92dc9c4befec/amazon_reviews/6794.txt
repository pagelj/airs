This grinder is will not make your life more convenient, nor is the freshly ground coffee any better than coffee you grind yourself in a separate grinder. Here's the stuff that drives me crazy about this coffee maker:- You have to clean out the chute every single time you make a pot.  Otherwise, it will clog.  This is a pain because you have to take off the reservoir, lift the chute plug, brush it out clean, and then put the whole thing back together again.  Every. Single. Time.- It will not make a full 12 cups of coffee (unless you like very weak coffee).  The basket only holds about 8 cups worth of ground coffee.  Any more than that and the basket overflows and you're left with a real mess on your hands.- The grinder is LOUD.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem because most grinders are loud.  However, if you are programming the coffee to start brewing in the morning and the rest of the house is asleep, everyone in the house will be awakened by the grinder.  I am an early riser and I like to let my young children sleep in on the weekends.  I like to have my coffee ready as soon as I get up but I have to remember to push the "grind off" setting so I don't disturb everyone else.  This is nit picky, I realize, but still... for some this might be a deal-breaker. Basically I find this whole coffeemaker pretty gimmick-y.  It's way too complicated and simply not worth the $ or effort.  Stick with a simple machine.  The grind-and-brew version is ridiculous.
