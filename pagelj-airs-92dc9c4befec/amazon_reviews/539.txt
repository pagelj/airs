Starter bag
We bought this bag as my husband's first bag.  Then after he got a better bag, it became mine.  It is NOT comfortable.  the lack of comparments is a serious problem.  You can only access the items in the bag through the top.  The sleeping bag compartment is a little tight too and I had to fight it to get my sleeping bag in there. Thankfully this bag has now been retired and we both have new bags.
