Complete junk for the price
I am usually very happy with LG products (I have two of their TVs and love them), but this player was a serious disappointment. It's playback is quite low quality, and disc read speed is super slow. On top of that, the build quality is very very cheap, and even the disc tray doesn't work well (sometimes it refuses to close, for example). I feel like I'm going to break the unit every time I use it. The software is also not well done. The interface is clunky to use, and the "apps" for netflix, etc. are very slow and hard to use. I would very highly recommend getting this unit from Panasonic instead: Panasonic DMP-BDT210 Integrated-Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player - it is the best Bluray player I've had out of 5 units (including the PS3).
