I've had this oven for about 2 months. First impression, this is a quality product. However, this is not a toaster oven, rather it is an oven that can toast. The oven is sufficient for all things baked (haven't tried the broiler yet). This oven is the real deal. I've baked pizzas, chicken, fish, potatoes with no issues. Here in the desert southwest we have to be mindful about firing up big ovens in the dead of summer. The heat from the oven can easily make the a/c run unnecessarily. This little oven with it's decent power is a major plus. Toasting: good luck. I've nearly set the bread on fire twice now. Any bread with sesame seeds or oats on the crust will blacken and smoke. Even at the lowest temp and toast lightness setting you cannot leave the oven unattended. This oven is really just too powerful for bread. The lack of a timer is weird but with the microwave and the oven timers nearby it's a non-issue. There was some mention of the two-pronged cords (no third ground) being a hazard. The product is UL Listed and as long as it is plugged into a GFCI outlet you should be fine in the electrical hazard area. I've gone through three toaster ovens in two years trying to find the right combo of toast vs baking. While this oven can toast, it is really designed to bake/broil. Guess I'll have to relent and just get an old school upright toaster. Nothing wrong with simplicity, right?
