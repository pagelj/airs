Great Laptop and Good Price
I love my new laptop because it is fast and fun to use.  Windows 8, that comes with the laptop, is a pain to use,  I am still with the windows 7 mind-set.  As time goes by, I am learning to use windows 8 and living with it.  The laptop is great while the jury is still out on windows 8.
