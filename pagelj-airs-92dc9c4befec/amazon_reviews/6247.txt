Very good
This book deserves an audience broader than those who love the science-fiction genre.  For instance, if you have ever enjoyed a seafaring novel by C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brien you probably will like this story about an astronaut marooned on Mars.  The isolation and the problem resolutions are told in the same way.  You might worry that the title involves alien beings or something supernatural.  Not so.  The near present-day story is taut and exciting and humorous as well.  It has some profanity and crude sexual references that may not be inappropriate under the circumstances.  I must recommend this book.
