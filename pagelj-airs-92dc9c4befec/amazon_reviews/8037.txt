Not pleased. returned twice
The first one at least kinda burned discs. For some reason, it couldn't complete the job. Then the thing wouldn't burn at all. The second unit Amazon sent me wouldn't even open. Even when I pushed the force eject button. I plugged in all the USB outlets and nothing. I also read on the bottom of the device that some computers dont supply enough power for the USB ports to be adequate.  They recommend purchasing an additional power adapter. i wish Id known that as well.  Overall, this is the first thing I've ever bought from Amazon that I wasn't please with. I actually edited this to include that though i returned this product twice, Amazon has a pretty amazing return policy. they give you three shipping options and the send out a replacement immediately if that's one of the options you chose. overall, it's cool to know that despite reviews, you can feel comfortable knowing that returns wont be a huge hassel.
