Close enough!
My BP-SC4000 arrived yesterday and I charged it to full capacity with a 5.5VDC 500MAH charger. I let my phone, a Samsung Galaxy SII Epic, discharge to approx. 2% battery. I plugged my phone into the SC4000 and in approx 2.5hrs py phone was charged backup to approx. 90% battery level. My phone was on the entire time it was charging, had I shut the phone off I probably could have got 100% battery charge out of this unit. My phone battery is 1800MAH and this unit has a 4000MAH battery in it should take my phone to full charge. Anyway, this unit works as advertised and was worth the investment. I'll test it with the solar charging next and see how well it does.
