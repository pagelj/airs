I care about two things when evaluating a knife:- How does it feel in my hand?- How long does the blade stay sharp? Virtually the cheapest of knives can be sharpened to a fine point that can cut as well as a $500 knife, but the edge will wear away quickly. With these Wusthof gourmets? Not a problem, I have owned them for several years and have yet to get them sharpened. I hand wash and dry them immediately which certainly helps. Yeah, the sticker is a sticker. Yes, it will come off. I don't care, but maybe you do. The only reason these don't get 5 stars is the steak knives feel very flimsy for the price. Since none of these knives are full tang it's somewhat an issue, but it only really bothers me with the steak knives. That said, it's never actually prevented me from using them, they're just a bit light and the blade flexes a bit.
