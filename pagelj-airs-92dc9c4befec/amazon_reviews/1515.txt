A great start to a great series
This book is the first in a series and I strongly recommend starting here and going on the whole journey of John Perry.  You won't regret it when the whole of the story is told.  My one criticism of the book comes from the ending (which is rather sudden).  This is the main problem with all the books in this series except the last.  A great read that works great on the Kindle for iPhone with its short chapters and nice length.
