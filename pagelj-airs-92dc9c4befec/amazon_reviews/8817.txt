An Excellent Prequel to an Excellent Game
The Fall of Reach is the excellent prequel to Halo the video game.  It's an entertaining book covering all of the events up until the crash landing on Halo which occurs at the beginning of the video game.  It follows the development of the Spartan soldiers, including the Master Chief. The book is written vary well and is extremely entertaining from the beginning to the end.  I read it in two days, barely being able to put it down to go to sleep.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, you'll be a fan of the book. The only down part to the story is that it makes the Master Chief in the game look a little less talented then he really is in the book.  I also felt that the author was a little constricted in what he was able to write about due to storyline restrictions put upon him by Bungie (you can't really point any out, but you can tell that they're there). In the end, it gives you a very good idea about the entire game.  Many aspects in the book will most likely be brought up in future Halo games, so it may be a bit of a spoiler for some.  Overall, I really did like the book, and if you're into Halo, you should easily be into this book.
