I love this little washer!  It easily washes a couple pairs of scrubs with a couple t-shirts, and some other little items in a single (large)load.  A smaller load is needed with a pair of jeans (or heavier items), and I usually need to wash a towel or a pair of sheets by themselves.  It washes very well and is easily rolled away for quick storage.  I simply do a load every other day, which is sufficient for me.  I was able to quickly replace the sink nozzle with the one included with a pair of pliers, enabling me to simply hook the hose on and off as needed. I was a bit skeptical when buying this washer, even after reading the reviews.  However, this was definitely a great buy.  After almost 5 months, I have had no problems.  It has saved me time and money.  It is so nice to be able to do laundry in my own home! EDIT:I've had this washer for 2 years now.  It is still going strong even though I tend to load more into it than I probably should.  I need to periodically replace the plumbers tape where the hose hooks up to the sink when the water pressure starts to cause a leak.  I would buy this washer again!  I just finally bought the matching Haier dryer (also awesome).
