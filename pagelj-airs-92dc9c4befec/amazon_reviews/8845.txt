Ok, first off there's a learning curve.  The first cup of coffee I brewed in this was AWFUL - grounds splattered everywhere, sediment in the cup, weak coffee... awful.  The tenth was pretty bad, too.  A few things I've figured out about making a good, strong cup of coffee in this machine:1) Ditch the reusable filter.  You can either buy #1 cone filters from Melitta (available on Amazon) or pick up the next size up in basket style from the grocery.  Those look way too big, but the edges actually fold to fit nicely into the Brew N' Go.  The #1 cones limit (but not badly) the amount of grounds you can use.2) Grind your coffee as you would for a normal machine.  This machine seems built to replicate the normal brewing process as much as possible, only in miniature.  If you grind your beans too fine so that you can use fewer beans and avoid spill-overs, you'll get a weak and over-extracted cup, just as you would in a normal machine.  Using a paper filter will avoid spill-overs and allow you to grind the beans normally.3) Be generous with the grind.  I like a strong cup, and about 3 level tablespoons gets one out of this machine.4) Fill the water reservoir at least to the line, maybe even a bit over, and use a tall cup to avoid splashes.5) Expect a 2-3 minute brew time.  If you use paper filters, there should be few or no grounds splashed inside the machine, and limited dripping when the cup is done brewing. Secondly, I've been using this and another model of the same type (another version of the Black and Decker Brew n' Go) for five months (this model) and three months (the other) at home and at work.  Using this one 2-4 times daily - and unplugging and replugging and washing and rinsing and otherwise harassing it - it still works perfectly.  I'm certain it's already paid for itself in savings on beans, so already I'm ahead of the game.  Get one!  Heck, get two!
