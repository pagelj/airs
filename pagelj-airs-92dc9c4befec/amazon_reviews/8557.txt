It's only when you've gone without something that you realize how useful it is. When I moved out of my last apartment that had a built in microwave, I tried to go without one. Two months of stove top and gas oven cooking was enough so I decided to pick this model up based on the reviews. The first thing I appreciated was the size. I never noticed that all of the microwaves I've used in the past were too small! I would recommend you get the biggest one you can afford, both in price and counter space. I never was an "auto" guy but I find myself using the auto defrost feature a lot. The difference with this model is that it doesn't over do it with the defrost. Other models I've used end up partially cooking the food I'm trying to defrost. Not a good thing when it's meat. Definitely gets the 5 star rating from me!
