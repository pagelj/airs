Love it! Love it! Love it!
Even since my oven started taking 30 minutes to preheat (Sears said this was normal, I don't believe it) I searched for a Convection oven. I bought this Breville after reading countless reviews of Toaster/Convection ovens. I love it. It's worth the money. Cooks quicker and perfect every time. I like the fact that it will defrost and then cook. The toast is perfect, although it takes a bit longer than the toaster. I'm probably going to put my toaster away and just use my Breville. I'm looking forward to using the plate warmer.  What a nice extra. The Breville is easy to use and consumer friendly. I like that. Now I'm going to check out the Breville Slow Cooker. You really get what you pay for.
