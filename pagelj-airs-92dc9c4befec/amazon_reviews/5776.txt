What a camera
It is good for the value Simple and user friendly. I do recommend it. Happy with all of the different attributes. Video work well clear HD quality. For the money it works well I own a Sony HDD handycam 30gig with 800X digital zoom to me it give a clear and more sharper photo and video.
