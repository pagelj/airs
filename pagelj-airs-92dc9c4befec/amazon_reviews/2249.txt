Hooked on Stability
This phone replaces a RAZR V3 that i've had since they first came out some years ago.  The phone still works.  However, it shows the ravages of a hard life as my companion.  I dropped it in the snow and, dropped it everywhere else, but every time i dropped her, she came up fully functional.  I like the size, shape, feel and I am familiar with its features.  My only disappointment with this new phone is that the selection of ring tones is sadly deficient.  The tone that i have enjoyed for years 'Sky Blue' is not among those that come within settings, and overall the selections available are significantly fewer than what was offered on my original phone.  But I guess I'll get used to it. If any one knows if/where i might download this ring tone the info would be appreciated.  D. Col√≥n
