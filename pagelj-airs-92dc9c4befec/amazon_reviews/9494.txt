I did a bit of reseach before making this purchase. Our old toaster was getting a little slow so we needed a new one. After reading some reviews decided to go with the Cuisinart. "On sale" at Kohls for $35, "on sale at JC Penney for $30. Bought it at Amazon for $27. Arrived on time and packaged well. Controls are placed well and are accurate. Toasts like a pro and we are loving our Sunday morning bagels.
