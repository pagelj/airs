Every few years, I pick up a new one of these from Hoover - and every time, the quality has gone down.  With this one, the motor smells, one of the wheels sounds like a mouse (squeaks) and the build quality is miles from the same model two purchases ago.  At the end of the day, it will hopefully pick up the dirt - but don't buy this model for fit, finish, and design and attachment quality.
