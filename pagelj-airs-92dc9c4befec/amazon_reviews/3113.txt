Same Price With Better CPU
Same price but better CPU. Don't know why people still buy 2240us. Got one of this from staples. They want to sell 2240us so this one was even not displayed. I reserved online and finally got one. Good substitute to my Desktop. Collected to TV for 1080p movie. Collected to PS3 controller for Games. This computer does everything. So far so good.
