Windows 8 is awful
The laptop itself is nice looking but I can't use it because of Win 8 OS, which I find totally ridiculous to have installed on a laptop with no ability to swipe screen.  My son and son-in-law claim it's easy to switch to desktop, which I can do but after that I'm lost.  No game apps pre-installed and after hitting Start, I'm at a loss.  Maybe after spending more time with it, I'll upgrade rating.  Meanwhile,  I'll stick with old XP notebook, which keyboard is going out and my Win 7 desktop which is in basement although after 3 back surgeries it's almost impossible for me to go up and down stairs. What was Microsoft thinking???
