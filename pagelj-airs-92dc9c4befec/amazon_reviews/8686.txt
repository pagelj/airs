or no stars.. but I was hopeful
I really tried to like this new micrometer. Looks good, decent packaging but when it comes down to it - what good is a micrometer if it doesn't measure accurately? At first, I got the measurement I expected from a known item. Let's say for the sake of example it is 1.70 inches. Every time subsequent to the measure I'd get a +.2 - even after resetting to zero and turning on, then off and resetting - whatever it took - but to no avail - 1.9 - every time. I could always add the difference - but what's the sense right? Sorry Neiko - get it right or stay out of the measurement business.
