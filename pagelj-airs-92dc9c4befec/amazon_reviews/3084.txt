Not Good for Making Toast
It's a toaster, right?  So you expect it to toast bread, right?  Well, as other reviewers have pointed out, this model toasts the bottom faster than the top.  You must turn the bread over to toast the top.  If you do not turn the bread over soon enough, the bottom gets burned before the top is done. Having special buttons for "pizza" and "hash browns" does not forgive the obligation of a toaster to make toast.  You should buy this model only if you plan to heat pizza or hash browns in it.  Whether those functions will perform better I cannot say.
