Nice camera!
There is not much to add to all other reviewers here, it is a good camera and takes fantastic photos, and quick. Battery last quite long, and build quality is also very good. The design is also mostly OK, but a little more grip wouldn't hurt. Kudos to Canon for they went with just 12 megapixel, and didn't push in more pixels in this relative small sensor. Just a few quirks which I'd like to point out:The LCD with over 900K pixels is razor sharp for photo viewing, but too bad that Canon does not take advantage of that to redesign the menu interface and the fonts / icons which appears on the LCD and they're still pixelated and cheap looking.1080 HD video recording is stunning, but the 24-fps is sub-par for today's standards. The zoom ring (and shutter button too) is way too small and difficult to control. One flaw that I still have with all my Canon cameras, that is some lighting condition (mainly florescent), some colors are not accurate. Purple shows like blue. And it's difficult to correct, even with white-balance control. I must do it in Photoshop. I also don't like the mega-strap that is included with this camera. While it might be useful for some, I wouldn't mind to have a regular smaller strap thrown in as well. (I bought this one Nikon 25770 AN-CP19 Black Strap for myself, and I love it). Otherwise, it's a beautiful piece.
