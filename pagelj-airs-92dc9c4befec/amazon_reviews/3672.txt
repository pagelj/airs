Absolutely fantastic. Takes longer to put the water and coffee in than it does to make a wonderful cup of coffee. We timed it and it only takes a minute and a half. It did take a couple of tries to get just the right amount of grounds for our taste... but that is just us being fussy. The right product at the right price for those who want a quick cup on the go.
