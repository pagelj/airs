I was on the fence for a 5 star review, because this is a great little unit with a lot of pros but there are a couple of compromises you need to be aware of. The biggest ;) compromise is that this is the smallest vacuum you've probably ever used, so if you do have a large room you will need to make a lot passes to get it done. The second is that it has trouble picking up large debris (stuff you can easily pick up yourself like mulch). But that's pretty much where the bad news stops and the good news begins. It's small size does pack in a lot of advantages...1) It's powerful suction picks up hair and dust that my big vacuum didn't2) It's inviting enough for my 5 year old to use (in fact she had a toy Dirt Devil, which was about 1/2 this size)3) It's easy to carry and easy to store4) I can use it on my stairs5) It's easy to empty and cleanSo for power and convenience of size and price this is a real winner, just make sure you don't mistake it for a primary vacuum for any home with more than 1200sq/ft of carpet or you'll wear yourself out. But it make a nice spot vacuum or one to keep on the other side/floor of the house.
