Great phone!
Love this phone. Bought it as a replacement for another RAZR that was dropped one too many times. The only thing I had to do was look online to configure the web browser to work with my provider (AT & T) as it was an unlocked phone. It was easy to find and do, otherwise it was ready to go.
