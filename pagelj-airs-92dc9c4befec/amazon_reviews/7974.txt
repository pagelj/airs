Great bag for a really low price
Really like the feel of the bag. It's still got that soft leather like feel, not so plastic feeling like some fake leather bags. Gave it 4 stars because it's a lot bigger than I expected. I'm pretty petite so some big bags look too big. This one's alright though since I still need room for diapers and baby stuff sometimes. The front pocket is almost too small for anything, but can fit lipstick and small items like that in it. I like the zipper pocket inside that divides the purse into two sections. And the bag itself is really deep so I don't like that things get lost in it so easily. I'll probably have to get a small make up bag to keep certain things contained. All in all, it looks good, isn't too heavy, and has plenty of pockets.
