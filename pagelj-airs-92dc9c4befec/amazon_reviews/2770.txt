Disappointing toaster
I love the features of this toaster so much that I replaced it with the same model when the first one stopped toasting one side of the bread after less than a year.  I am also unimpressed with the current one.  Frankly, it just works well enough to not get rid of it.  Disappointing for a toaster with such potential and a $50 price tag.  My mother-in-law has had the two-slice version for a number of years and is quite satisfied with it.
