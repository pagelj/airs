Real, Raw, Beautiful
It's not often that I reread a book, and even less often I give the book the title of a "favorite"- but Redeeming Love, for me, is a book I can read many times over and I truly do love this book. A fictional take on the Biblical story of Hosea, this book is heartbreaking in it's real-ness. You ache for each of the main characters. You can understand both of their worlds, fears, and frustrations. Angel is a woman who has never known what real love is and can't begin to understand Michael Hosea and his ways. Michael Hosea is a man of God who is blindly following what he believes to be the path set out for him. This is the kind of book you will want to consume as quickly as possible- I was up until all hours of the night knowing I would pay the price in the morning but I was unwilling to put it down. Rivers is a talented writer and in this novel she transports you into the minds and lives of her characters- they are real and they are raw and they are beautiful. Personally, I find this to be such a beautiful allegory of how God loves his people despite how they prostitute themselves to the world and worldly pleasures. For those who argue of the non-Biblical moments of this book, I argue back that this is a work of fiction, not the Bible. When reading Redeeming Love, go in with an open mind and open heart.
