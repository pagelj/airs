Good but not great
I have had this case for nearly 6 months and at first I really liked it. What I don't like as much about it now is that the rubber exterior has stretched out to the point it doesn't fit very well from when I had to remove it and re-install. As well, the small rubber gaskets / access flaps have ripped or fallen off the bottom at the charger location and headphone jack location. It does protect your phone, but for the money I think the Commuter case is just as good or a cheaper case from another competitor. I just feel the integrity of this product is lacking over the long haul. A case like this should last at least year without any significant issues. It is very bulky, but you should already know that before you purchase and wasn't an issue for me. I would not purchase this product again.
