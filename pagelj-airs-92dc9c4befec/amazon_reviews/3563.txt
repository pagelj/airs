This unit is packed with a lot of features. I doubt I will ever play any games while I'm driving, but the navigation comes in handy plus it can actually approximate the speed your going so it's easy to help understand if your speedometer is calibrated right. I am having some trouble getting the bluetooth phone hooked up. I'll have to play with it some more. The large screen does give you a good view if you hook up a backup camera to it. I put this in my 69 Chevelle SS, so its cool to have a muscle car with the newest high tech gadgets!
