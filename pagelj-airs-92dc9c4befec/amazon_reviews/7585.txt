Recently moved into a new home that has all hardwood floors.  My previous vacuum wasn't that compact and was more for a place with carpets.  After researching for a couple days and reading reviews on Amazon, I settled for this one.  For the price its a decent vacuum. What I like:1.)  Very light weight (I was able to hold this in one hand with ease while doing the steps area from living room to my upper level)2.)  Great suction3.)  Noise level.  I think the noise level is fine.  It's not really loud like I thought it would be after reading reviews.  Maybe I just have realistic expectations that it is a vacuum and there is going to be noise =o). What I don't like:1.)  The wheels I think could be improved.  It doesn't glide as easy across the floors as it should.  However, because it's so light it ends up being okay because you just hold it if your moving across a big room.2.)  The floor attachment looks/feels very cheap. It's also very hard switching the to the carpet function using the switch.  I feel like it's going to break it's so hard to switch.3.)  The one 'dust attachment' was not all that.  I had already ordered a separate one because I saw a picture of the one that came with this and could tell it was not going to be what I needed. Overall opinion:  I am going to keep it.  For the price point it ends up being a decent vacuum and BISSELL is a very good company so I am sure if something goes wrong down the road they will make it right..  I really didn't want to have to spend a ton of money on a vacuum for a house that has all hard wood floors.  I do have a coupe of throw rugs that this worked fine on.  If you are looking for something at a reasonable price and have mainly hardwood floors with a couple throw rugs here and there then you should give this a try.
