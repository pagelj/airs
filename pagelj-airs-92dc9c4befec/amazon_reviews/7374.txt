I'm very pleased with this vacuum.  It's got great suction and the long cord makes it easy to vacuum two rooms without unplugging it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be nice if it had a height adjustment for carpets, but it's certainly functional just as is.  I know people have commented that the hose breaks loose, but I haven't used the hose yet... and probably won't.  I bought this just to use on bare floors and wall to wall carpeting, and so far it works beautifully on both.
