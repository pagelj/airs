Have a pry bar?
As others have said, this thing will stick to anything! Love it, this is the first mount that has actually worked on my dash so I didn't have to put it on the windshield. Works with many different phones and the ports are all accessible. It is a little tight with the case on my Galaxy S4 but still works so you may want to keep that in mind.
