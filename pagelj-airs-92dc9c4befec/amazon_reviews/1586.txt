Two Parts of the book especially interesting
I filmed several scenes from Ender's Game with a group of about five people for an English class assignment.  One of the aspects of the book that helped us do the assignment and that improved its overall quality was the dialogue before each chapter between two of the people at the Battle School.  Their discussions of Ender's emerging violence added to Ender's own thoughts. Another part of the book that I liked was the dual storyline with the main story of Ender at Battle School and a secondary story of Peter and Valentine with Earth politics.
