We recently purchased this vacuum after our Tempo Widepath's motor burned up after a few years of use.  We were quite happy with the value of the bagged Tempo, and it did a fantastic job compared to any bagless we previously used, so we were a bit skeptical when purchasing another bagless unit.  A leading consumer review publication had this vacuum listed number one in bagless uprights, and for the price, we thought we would give it a shot.  So far, we couldn't be happier with the value and performance of this vacuum.  It picks up pet hair very nicely, and is quite easy to empty and clean.  The cord rewind feature is a fantastic feature, and we haven't had any issues with it so far as long as you don't let the cord rewind and snap back in quickly.  The vacuum actually seems fairly quiet compared to the Tempo that we used previously.  The viewing window to see the condition of the belt is also a nice feature, and the quick release tabs on the bottom would make it a cinch to change quickly.  The only feature that I think this vacuum lacks is a button to stop the roller from spinning if you wanted suction only for hardwood floors.  All in all, a great product with an even better price.
