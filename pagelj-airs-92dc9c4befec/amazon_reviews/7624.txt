Good size oven, good toaster too
I bought this product because the good reviews on Amazon.  I am happy about it so far.  It is a sqaure so it is suitable to bake pizza.  The food comes close to the heating element so it is good for boiling. I use it a lot as a toaster also. There are some concerns from other peoples's reviews.  It is true that it makes a humming  noise.  I think the handle was properly located.  Burning your hands should not be a concern.  Teh control buttons are somewhat complicated so read the manual first.
