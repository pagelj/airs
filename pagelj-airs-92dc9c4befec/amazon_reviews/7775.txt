I bought the Mini quick draw first and was so impressed with it's feel and function that I bought it's big brother and I can say that I was not disappointed. Gerber sends excellently sharpened blades from the factory. With only minor honing and polishing, this knife takes a truly frighteningly sharp edge and holds it for a very long time. The workings are a bit slower than the Mini due to the greater mass in the Quick Draw (Sr.) blade. One of the complaints I've consistently read for both models of these knives is that they "can open in your pocket." I believe this to be Liberalistic Chicken Little'ism rather than any factual based experience. Both blades must be opened approximately 30 degrees before they'll spring and there is a distinct CLICK in the locking mechanism JUST before this point is reached. Certainly, one must be cautious with such an implement, but we do not need to create the impression of danger where there is none and only nominal "common sense" is required for safe function.
