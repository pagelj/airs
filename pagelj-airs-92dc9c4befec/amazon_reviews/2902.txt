All cables are made equal, some more than others!
After reading a lot, I picked up these mediabridge cables and all I can say is I am one satisfied customer!  The quality of the cables is outstanding and it supports the new 1.3 HDMI standard.  I'm using it on my LG 1080p Plasma and the difference is subtly noticeable over the cable I was using previous to the mediabridge. Good job and I will buy from you again!  I will also recommend to all my friends!
