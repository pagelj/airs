For those of you Baby Boomers who recall what it was like to eat a nice piece of toast with breakfast, those days are long gone.  If you happen to find one of these older toasters in an antique store, you might have to have it re-wired since it might be a fire hazard.  These older toasters had larger heating elements & likely used more electricity.  I don't know why companies stopped making these toasters, but I suspect it had something to do with the EPA.  Bottom line?  The new toasters don't toast the same.  I've owned some models that took a ridiculous amount of time to produce toast.  So, if people have to contend with smaller heating elements, they might as well have enough watts to get the job done.  This 1000 watt toaster was a great find.  I looked high & low for this toaster.  Most of the discount stores either had lower wattage toasters and/or wanted too much money for the higher wattage toasters.  This Waring Toaster was the best deal & I looked everywhere!  It toasts evenly on both sides.  It is very simple to operate.  I would imagine a chimpanzee could operate one of these units.
