Not durable
Was pleased with the product for the first ~3 months. It does not hold up to heat!!! I left it in my car while at work and the clips expanded open and back flap warped. Completely unusable now. Would not recommend. Thought it might just be mine, however a friend also purchased the product mentioned she had the same issue when using at the beach.
