HD-DVD at a great price and painless setup
I have too many DVD players to count; including three 400-DVD jukeboxes and two HD-Upconverting players.  The 360 HD-DVD player blows them all away - which is what I was expecting. The picture on my 62" 1080p Mitsubishi looks fantastic even though the HD-DVD player hooks up through the component cables.  Of course it does not support 1080p through its HDMI inputs either, so I guess it doesn't matter that the 360 is currently without HDMI output. King Kong is a visually stunning film in the first place, but the HD-DVD version looks amazing (although I did see some graininess during some of the scenes).  I just bought the Mission Impossible 3-pack and Serenity, and have plans for Chronicles of Riddick, The Last Samurai, and U-571. If you already have an Xbox 360, this seems like a decent price to enjoy HD-DVD.  It may not be the HD player of my dreams, but the picture is much better than my HD-Upconversion players.
