I have a small condo and this microwave fits in perfectly! Doesn't take up much space and works just fine (have had it for abt 2 months now).  I haven't noticed any problems with the power, it seems to heat things up just fine for me...  However, I will warn you that it is SMALL!!!  both inside and out!!!  for 99% of the microwaving I do, this isn't a problem.  However, this does become a problem when trying to microwave large bags of popcorn...  they tend to get stuck and burn... But, easy solution, I just buy the mini-bags (which I should be doing anyway for portion control) and they work just great!
