Excellent quality cable
I bought this cable to replace the cable I got with my Toshiba TV & the cable comcast provided me for their HD DVR boxWith Comcast cable I occasionally saw screen going blank for a 2-3 seconds. It was as if the signals were being lost. I replaced that cable with amazon basics HDMI cable and my screen never missed a beat now. It is a very good quality cable and for the price gives an excellent purchase value. I am using the other cable to connect Apple TV.
