Perfect!
Just exactly what my Dora loving 2 year old wanted!  The pack is big enough to carry around her stuffed boots and Dora and twins dolls.  Sometimes the velcro doesn't stay fastened when it is full, but only if it is really full.  The map is made of a plastic and pretty durable.  Due to a stomach illness the backpack was washed three times in 2 days and still looks great.  Great construction.  My 4 year old wants one now!
