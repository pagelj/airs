Great Bag!!
I bought one of these for my fiance and his son borrowed it for a trip to Germany.  When he came back, he didn't want to return it to his dad! I got one for him as well for a graduation gift and he was all smiles!!  Lots of places to store things and they both say it is a comfortable bag to carry on your back.
