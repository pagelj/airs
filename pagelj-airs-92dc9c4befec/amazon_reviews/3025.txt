This is an expensive toaster that looks very nice. However it toasts very unevenly with one side burning and the other barely tan. The bagel button doesn't appear to function and there is no indication of which direction the sliced side of the bagel is to go (although common sense dictates toward the middle). The slots are not long enough to accomodate the bigger slices of bread (rye, poulsbo, etc). I wish someone would invent a toaster that actually functions! I'm on a mission to find it! I've gone through about 20 toasters in my lifetime in search of one that works! ... they can put a man on the moon... yaddy yaddy yadda
