***THIS IS NOT A THROWING AXE*** Pay no mind  to the stupid people leaving reviews blasting this product for not holding up to being thrown into a tree (or whatever else) repeatedly. This (being a CQB/last stand type of item) has a nice balance and weight in hand; I would hate to be on the business end of this guy.
