I don't know where else to ask
I have a new application for this headset, not for iOS but for Macintosh. I don't know where else to ask this question, so I'll ask it here: is this headset compatible with Dragon Dictate 3 for Mac? It seems that Dragon Dictate would a natural application for this headset, but do they talk to each other? If not now, maybe someday.
