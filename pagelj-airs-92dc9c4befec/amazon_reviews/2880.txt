A kid's review
Population Police officers were yeling at them "up! up! up!" Your country demands your service!"  Matthias' llife before Nedlier School had sometimes required instant alertness, even when awakening from deep sleep.  So while the other boys in thye room sat up or groggily moaned without opening their eyes-huh' or wha's happ'ning?"-only Matthias and Percy had the presence of mind to gather up their belongings before they were herded out.  If you like thrillers this is the book for you.  This is the most exciting "shadow children" book yet!
