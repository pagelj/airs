Cheaply made, vendor stood behind it well
AC adapter was dead on arrival - seller replaced it within days of my contact. Second one still working after a few months of occasional use. Car charger works great. Cable is not as good as Apple, but seems better than most non-Apple cables (I have tried 3-4)
