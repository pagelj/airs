Works like a charm
Excellent!!. It really solved my purpose, as I wanted to be able to plug in my wall charger in the car for my Samsung Galaxy S3 because the USB charger would take 8 times longer, which meant my phone would get discharged in no time when I am using LTE and GPS constantly in the car. Thanks to this, now my phone is always charged no matter how heavier the usage is. And the flexibility of having extended cord and additional ports is just perfect. The charger fan though makes louder noise when positioned in a certain way, so I have to flip it back and forth every now and then to reduce the noise which then almost is negligible. Otherwise, no real complaints though, great product and price!!
