Lots of patch work leather handbag. Black lambskin double compartment bag
It's made of leftover pieces of leather. Too many pieces are used to stitch such a small bag. Such type of patches may look ok for a tote bag of at least 2 ft size. Also, different textured leather is used for different patches,  like one piece is smooth finish and the other has small rough dots thereby the whole purse doesn't look like one piece of leather. Now about the design. It has two zippers on top. but these zippers are actually from  two different bags. It's like take two  small purses with a top zipper on each one and keep them together and at the centre point glue it. It's not glued all the way. Now u have one purse with two zippers, from the sides and below u can pull them away from each other. Due to the central stiching it sticks to each other. It's not for a lady to carry. Not for teenagers and not for kids. It is just too plain. Gents may or can carry by using the belt hook. Overall it's a dollar tree stuff. Black lamb skin ........ Cross body bad
