Broken on first try
i bought this lens and it came in while i was on vacation and was waiting for me. i was excited because everyone told me this was a great lens and very sharp. Now that may be a fact but i will never know because once i attached the lens to my camera it made a grinding noise as i tried to focus. when i detached the lens the front element glass fell from the body of the the lens housing. This will most likely be my first and last canon lens if the seller doesn't replace.
