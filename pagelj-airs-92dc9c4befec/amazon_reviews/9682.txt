Nice but with problems.
I bought this unit from Amazon in November of 2011 for $149.99.  It crapped out on me during the first week of April 2012 after infrequent use and wouldn't play anything.  Since it was outside of Amazon's return window (about 60 days) I had to make a case for how ridiculous the policy was if the unit became defective in less than a year or even 6 months.  Costco would have taken it back in a flash. Amazon did give me a full refund, however.  Thank you Amazon!  Although it was otherwise 'ok', I wouldn't march with it in the local Saint Patrick's Day parade.  My biggest issue, other than the early demise, was how it handled older DVDs like Titanic and Midway.  It yielded a sort of 'mini screen' that I couldn't correct so I had to use a regular cheap Toshiba DVD player which actually yielded a much better quality picture.  Go figure.  I bought a Samsung blu-ray player to replace this one for a lot less money at Costco and it handled the older DVDs with no problem and was generally better than the Panasonic in all ways - I have always had a prejudice against Panasonic since the 70s with their cheap hi-fi but the reviews prompted me to check it out - no more.  I went to Costco because I was afraid of the Amazon return policy vs. Costco which will take almost anything back.  Bought a 60" plasma from them last year and complained about a $3,000 50" Sony I had bought 3 years earlier and had to throw away.  The Costco woman told me to bring it back but I wasn't about to go that far!
