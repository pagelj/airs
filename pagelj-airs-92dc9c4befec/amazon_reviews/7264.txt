bad product poor service- actually no service
Recieved product ahead of schedule, which was great. Installed product easily and it only turned on for 5 minutes. Color went out and there was a bad spot in the middle of the screen. I emailed the company and still have not received a response from them. So I have a useless ipod sitting on my counter. It is a waste  of money.
