Good buy
I am a consumer of Black and Decker products. This convection oven fits my counter top well as I don't like a lot of "Clutter" and this oven was the right size. It is used 95% of the time for baking as I don't want to heat up my whole house with the larger stove ovenThe style is good and the oven size is perfect for my use.
