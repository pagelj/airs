A great camera once you figure out how to get it all working
I am now running 4 of these in my home.  I wanted to jump in and write a review about all the discussion around this camera. First, yes, there are some fake reviews in here - its pretty obvious.  Shame on them and shame on Amazon for allowing it.  HOWEVER..... I got my first camera and it had a learning curve for installation.  Getting the camera to work is the easy part, remote viewing from your iPhone when not connected to your home network is another story..... BUT ITS ACTUALLY EASY ONCE YOU FIGURE IT OUT. I am dangerously tech savvy - but far from a pro, and now I could set up one of these cameras in 5 min. I will say, Focam recently did some set-up videos on their website that are really quite good.  If you follow that, you will be set-up in no time. Everytime I see these cameras go on sale, I want to get another.... but for now 4 is enough.
