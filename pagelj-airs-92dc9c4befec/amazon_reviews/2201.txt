Decided to buy a new coffee maker because we just weren't getting "good" coffee even though we tried MANY brands of coffee, ground & whole bean; used fresh, cold, filtered water; and tried all the "tricks" for good coffee.  I really wanted to see & touch before purchasing but could not find a store that had this maker.  I read LOTS of reviews for LOTS of brands and decided on this one.  Amazon had the best price.  Happy with the looks, ease of use, and overall product. Number 4 cone filters do fit without any adjustments.  Coffee brews fast and is hot although I do temper the carafe beforehand. The only negative about the maker is the screw lid.  To pour, you need to line up the dots, which are difficult to see in low light.  To remedy this, I painted the dots white.  Problem solved.  I'm still looking for a "good", o. k. maybe "great" cup of coffee. This is a good coffee maker, but I may need to go to a french press.
