Well worth the price
I picked this case up for around $6 and it does exactly what I need of it. Protects my camera's screen and holds an extra battery. It fits in my purse and pocket easily, and has a decent clip on it if I'd want easier access on a backpacking adventure. It is a soft case, so it will not protect against falls. The zippers are holding up well and I am happy.
