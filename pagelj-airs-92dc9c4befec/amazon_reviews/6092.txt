Works great, fits my Toyota Corolla
This fits my Corolla just fine and does a great job charging my iPhone. I was a little nervous about it fitting my car power thing tightly from reading other reviews, but it is perfect. Great product for the price. I use it all the time and am glad I finally bought it!
