Worked but not amazing
I dropped my iPhone and smashed the screen. I found this and it sent perfectly on time and very nicely packed. The tools they sent with it were cheap and did not work. I could not get the glass off the phone. I took almost two hours working on. Screen is bigger the ones from Apple so the home button is really sunken. But I dont see a problem with the sensitivity of the screen. I can actually see my screen again!!!
