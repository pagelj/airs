Could not get it to add contacts and the manual is awful! I returned the phone
I was getting this phone for an upcoming trip to Australia. It sounded perfect but it has a very unclear manual and although I am pretty good with technology I could not add any contacts. I check the manual which is so basic it did not help at all and even checked online at the web site and again just in a general  search with no help at all. Finally I returned it and bought a different phone.
