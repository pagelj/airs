This trash can is classy looking, matches well into a stainless/black kitchen, and so far (one month in) has worked great.  The size is just right for a kitchen.  The sensor takes about 2 seconds to register before opening the lid, while I'd prefer a little more immediate response, but oh well.  Overall, a very cool addition to my kitchen.  If it goes bad, I'll come back and update the review.
