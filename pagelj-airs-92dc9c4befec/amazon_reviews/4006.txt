Room to Pack my Entire Life
This purse is huge. I'm pretty sure I could pack my entire life into it. Last weekend, I tossed in my wallet, my Kindle, a book and my heavy DSLR camera. I still had room to spare. The purse is constructed of high-quality materials. It looks stylish. I bought the gray one and am happy with the overall appearance. There are pockets inside to keep my phone and keys from being lost in the potential black hole. There is also a zipper divider in the center. I like it generally and  am especially glad that it is sewn at the bottom to separate the two sides of the purse.
