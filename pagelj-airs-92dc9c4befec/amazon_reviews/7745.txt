Best convection counter-top oven I've ever had!
I've had several convection counter-top and toaster ovens over the past few years, with every one of them disappointing me by breaking down, thermostat going out of whack, fan making excessive noise, etc. A friend told me about the Breville line of ovens, warning me they are a bit more expensive, and swearing they're worth every penny. He wasn't kidding! I've had mine for a couple of months now and absolutely love it! It does exactly what I want, when I want, and is super simple to use. I especially like the preheat function, bringing it up to temp while I finish getting things ready for it. No more guessing about the temp in the oven. When it hits the desired temp, it beeps. When it's done cooking it beeps. This is an oven for the 21st century. I don't think I'll be using my full size one for anything except storage anymore because this Breville can do everything I can think of. Thanks Breville for making a product worth owning.
