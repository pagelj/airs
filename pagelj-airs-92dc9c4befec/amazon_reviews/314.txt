The F5914 is very easy to operate.  I read the instruction manual and went to work and the machine did just as it was supposed to do.  Some reviews I read on the upholtery cleaner said it didn't perform well, but I could not find any problems with it.  No problems with leaking or anything.  I think if you read the instructions you will have no problems.  Glad I bought this machine!
