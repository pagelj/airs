Not worth the money
So this was for my almost 4-year old son.  It was pricey - in my opinion.  My son loves to take pictures with my camera and I thought this would be great for him to have his own.  It doesn't have a clear screen at all.  You can hardly see the images after they are taken.  I wish it were a little less "kid" and a little more "camera."  Kids like stuff that's more realistic and like what the adults use.  It is durable.
