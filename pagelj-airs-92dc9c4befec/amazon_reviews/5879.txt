We used this product at a "vacation home" for seven days this Thanksgiving.  I never thought grinding your own coffee could enhance the flavor.. we were wrong. The coffeemaker was wonderful.  When we returned home, we purchased one through Amazon. com and love grinding our own coffee, then brewing like we did at Thanksgiving. I will not go back to buying pre-ground coffee beans again. Using it every morning and just LOVE it.  What a way to start a morning!!  Thanks.
