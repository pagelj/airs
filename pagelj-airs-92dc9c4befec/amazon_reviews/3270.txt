This toaster oven does everything we need it to do, from re-heating to toasting, broiling and baking small meals.  It wasn't purchased to replace the convection oven or the stove top, and doesn't need to cook a turkey, bake a ham or broil t-bones.  It does need to have a relatively small footprint and fit in under-counter  storage space, which it does perfectly well. It is a great machine at a great price.
