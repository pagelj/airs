good plot but the scottish vocabulary distracting
the book in general was cute, but the plot was to find a jewel. when they did, the entire scene took two paragraphs! all of the hype fot two short paragraphs was a letdown. my largest complaint was the poor use of the scottish verbage. there were only five words jused repetively. ye, yer , and a few others made me want stop reading it. as it was, i skipped a few chapters and got the ending i wanted. next time droo the gaelic and stick with what you know
