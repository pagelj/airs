Price is awesome, functionality is great but...
If you use this for a prolonged shoot, it may get really hot. Particularly around the battery compartment. Not having used name brand ones, I am not sure if this is normal. I recommend a cooling off period frequently. Other than that, it is a darn fantastic deal considering the price, functionality and design.
