Young Adult Sci-Fi
I read every book in the series and found the story line to be enjoyable.  But Tom Harris is not a very good writer.  His sentence structures are simple, his dialog is artificial.  Character development is incredibly limited and his narrative very one-dimensional.  The books are a great read - if you're 13. Want to read a serious space opera, one written for adults?  Try Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse).  There are two books and two novellas in the series.  The third book comes out this summer.
