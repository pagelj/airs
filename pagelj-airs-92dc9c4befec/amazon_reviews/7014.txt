About 2 months ago we bought a Keurig B60 for my husband.  We'd been wasting coffee for years when he would make a potful, drink a cup or 2 and toss the rest.  Back in 2002 I got a Nespresso C190 machine because I like the richer flavor of espresso, but he could never get used to it and kept making drip coffee.  So over the last 2 months I've had ample opportunity to compare the 2 systems. Keurig has one gigantic win over the Nespresso, and that's that the K-cups are more readily available and there are more varieties of them.  The price is slightly less per cup (at this time, 8 cents less per cup) than Nespresso capsules.  Machine-wise the two are similar in their ease of use. However, the Nespresso has a couple of good points over the Keurig.  The K-Cup coffees are bland, like restaurant coffee; the Nespresso drinks are strong and rich.  Also, the Nespresso machine lets me make my drink as strong or weak as I like by controlling the amount of water that goes into the cup.  My parents like to use the Nespresso and make one capsule in a coffee mug, but I like to use it and make one capsule in a demitasse cup.  It also has a frothing cappuccino attachment but we never use that. Nespresso almost loses this competition because, with their capsules being only available through them, I have to pay shipping.  (With the K-Cups I either get them locally or get free shipping from Amazon.)  I'd love to be able to pick up capsules at Sur La Table or similar stores. This comparison comes out almost completely equal.  Ultimately it boils down to your taste.  For me, I'm willing to suffer the Nespresso hassles because their drinks simply taste better.  But my husband is equally willing to put up with the Keurig flavors because of the greater convenience.
