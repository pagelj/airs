kindle fire
I love my kindle fire!! It is perfect for taking anywhere. I love that I can read and not have to have a light to see the words on the pages. I carry my kindle fire in my purse so I can have it anywhere and I have no worries that it will be damaged like a book would get when placed in my purse. I highly recommend the kindle fire to those who love to read and are considering a tablet!!!
