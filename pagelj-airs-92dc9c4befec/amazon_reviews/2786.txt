Normally I've gotten the cheaper B&D models in the past, which worked OK. Thought I'd get something a little better this time, but it doesn't seem to have been worth it. The construction of this model is quite good. There's decent quality overall. But the way it works is bizarre. For toast, you set the top function dial to 'Toast' (obviously)... Then the bottom dial is supposed to control the length of time it heats. To the left is the least, to the right is the most. The problem is that going 1/4 inch above the full left setting, is usually the difference between not enough and burnt. I timed it and there is more than a 30 second difference in just 1/4 inch twist. If you set it to the middle, you'd probably set the food on fire. So the bottom dial is pretty much useless. Sometimes I wonder if companies even try their own products. I don't know how it does cooking, since I don't use it for that.
