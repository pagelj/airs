Great picture - just could not pick up local channels
This unit had a wonderful picture when you could get a channel to come in.  I bought this to put in the kitchen to watch while cooking.  I wanted to get our local channels - NBC, CBS, ABC & Fox as those are the ones I watch while cooking.  I could get maybe one to come in and in order to get one of the others, I would have to move the antenna.  It was not worth messing with.  I did send back and really DID NOT like having to pay restocking fees so I lost almost $30.  This should have been mentioned prior to purchasing.
