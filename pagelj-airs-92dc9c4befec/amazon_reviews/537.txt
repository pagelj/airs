New screen... More Problems
The part fit but it had a dent on the lower left side. Also, the screen started to have horizontal lines once the screen warmed up on full brightness. The kit was missing one tool (which is not a part of the kit) that would allow you replace the screen with no additional tools needed. This was a good replacement kit but if my screen didn't have the horizontal lines issue, it would have been perfect.
