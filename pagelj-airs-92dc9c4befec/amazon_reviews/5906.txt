Awesome Purse!
This purse made me laugh out loud when I saw it, and it makes me smile every time I look at it! It is a great quality and will be very easy to keep clean. I love how large the bottom of the purse is, as it keeps its shape no matter how little I am keeping in it. So far, it has not been uncomfortable to carry or had any cons except for the small zipper- it is good quality, but the opening is narrow. I get so many comments on this purse and people seem to love it almost as much as I do.
