Awesome Camera
I previously owned a 10D, purchased in 2004. This full frame camera blows that old beast out of the water.■ full frame: I had no idea how much picture I was missing. My 28mm zoom on the 10D was missing 50% of the image. On the 6D, I have a much more picture to capture. The 28mm on the 10D gave me the same image as my 50mm on the 6D. I can never go back to a smaller sensor.■ ISO: the light sensitivity on this is terrific. The auto-ISO is very flexible, and under low light conditions gives results with very low levels of noise, especially when compared to the 10D.■ wi-fi, gps: features that I've not explored to the fullest. I did control the camera from my android phone--way cool.■ Compatibility - all my EF lenses, flash, and remote control work with the 6D■ light - it is more compact and lighter than my 10D■ pop-up flash - there is no pop-up flash, but I didn't use the one on my 10D either (it would pop-up uncontrollably due to a drop)■ rapid fire - blown away by the rapid sequence of pix. I could get 9 rapid frames on my 10D before having to wait for buffer to write to memory. the 6D processes so much faster■ LCD screen - is bright, large, and menus are easy to navigate
