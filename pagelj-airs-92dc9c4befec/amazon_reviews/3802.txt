Great read ... highly recommended
Wow, I was so inspired as I just finished reading Wired. This a very easy to read and interest catching book. It really keeps you guessing all through the story and definitely gets your imagination going as to the possibilities of an advanced human intelligence. I loved the end of this book that had more unexpected twist than a salted pretzel.. Trust me on this one. You will love this book.  Get it now.
