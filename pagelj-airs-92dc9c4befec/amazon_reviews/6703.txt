very thin steel, rusted and required sharpening after a just few days of use
I was very suprised to find out how thin the steel blades were, so thin they bended while I was cutting an apple. The knives got rusted and dull after just a few days of use.  I looked throughout the website to find customer servcie number however i could not.  Will demand my money back, including shipping cost.
