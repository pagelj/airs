Love this but Buy it on Amazon!
I had my eye on this bag when I saw it at BestBuy for almost twice the price.  I bought one for my honey for that price but couldn't bring myself to pay that much for a second one.  When I saw them offered on Amazon, I jumped at it and I'm not sorry I did.  It's a great little bag. Warning, do not overstuff!  The zippers don't like that. :)I like this so much, I'm going to buy myself a second one because I've collected a lot of gear!
