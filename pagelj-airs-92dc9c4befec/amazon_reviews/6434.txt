Great backpack for the price
I wanted a backpack for traveling to sports tournaments and going on trips. I've been using the fat boy for a few months and it has held up very well. I got it from Amazon for about $30. The backpack seems to be high quality, has good compartments and does the job. In my opinion, great buy for the price.
