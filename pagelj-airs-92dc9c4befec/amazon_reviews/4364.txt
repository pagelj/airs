So cool!
I got this for a gift for my little brother whom i'm taking camping. This product is awesome! The cooler part is huge (20 cans). The top part is big enough for his clothes, his flash light, and even a small towel. The pockets are big enough to put his first aid items, bug spray and a few other things. Over all this is really a good buy and he loves it!
