It's not too good to be true at this price!
Unbelievable picture from this cable.  I used one on a 73" Mitsubishi DLP for the 1080 feed from hi-def cable box, and one on a 42" Sharp LCD for the hi-def cable.  Unbelievable picture, blows away the picture quality from the component cables that were in place.  Don't let the ridiculous prices of HDMI cables at local super-stores keep you from an amazing picture!
