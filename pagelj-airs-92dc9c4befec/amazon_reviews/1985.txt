No instructions supplied.  Difficult to apply
Fortunately, I had purchased a screen protector for my previous Android phone, and therefore knew I had to apply to absolutely clean, lint free surface.  With the previous protectors, there was a little "tool" included which helped ease out the air bubbles.  This time, the instructions and tool were not included.  Too bad for anyone who did not know to clean the screen first etc.  Anyway, it took two tries (3 protectors in the pack) and my Samsung Galaxy III screen now has a protector.  There are a couple of tiny bubbles, definitely not intrusive, and therefore the 3 star rating.  Also, it was delivered within the time frame posted, so all in all, not a bad purchase.  The price added a star as well.
