The Lost Future sshould stay lost.
I love my science fiction, but this fell far short of creating a very interesting movie to watch. The cave scenes were poorly managed and I think some more could have been done with trying to build the story between the "beasts" and those that were trapped in there. The rest of the story moves slowly and just does not come together that well. This amazing elixir and and how it was created seems plausible, but when the son struggles to read a book I found it difficult to build a realistic relationship between how he could be a replacement as the person to help the future. It was just too far fetched and the movie did nothing to support that theory. Other than that you still wanted to know how the characters developed, but they just left you hanging to much that you could just not get into the movie that much. So if you are a die hard who just does not stop in the middle of the movie then watch and see. That is all I can say about that. Thank you
