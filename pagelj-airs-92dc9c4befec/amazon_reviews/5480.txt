A Great Toaster for a lover of Breads!
The Bodum Toaster is a great edition to any home and has many features that your standard toaster doesn't. One of my favorites is the option to Defrost, which comes in handy when making a quick frozen waffle or toast. It also comes with variable browning settings, variable width settings which range from slim to bagel size. A toasting rack for Bagels, Bread and Croissants and or course power cord storage to save you that extra bit of space. This toaster works really well, and extremely quickly which is always a plus. The only thing I wish is that it was a 4 slice toaster instead of 2, but overall I would highly recommend this toaster to anyone, especially if you love bagels or croissants!
