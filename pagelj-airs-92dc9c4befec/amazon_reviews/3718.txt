This coffee maker makes excellent coffee. I have had the thermos keep the coffee hot for 5+ hours. Its easy to clean, heats to the correct temperature, and is quite attractive. The only downside at all is that the documentation comes in several different flyers and formats, and should be condensed and cleaned up. This is a really nice coffee maker!
