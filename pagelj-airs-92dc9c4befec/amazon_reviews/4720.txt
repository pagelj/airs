Sleek, Solid and Disappointing
I own the 10903 Coffee Grinder, also from Bodum's Bistro serires, and in both form and function, it's a 5-star product. While this toaster is equally beautiful on the counter and solidly built, it falls far short when it comes to function. If you wish to toast anything other than square sandwich bread, be prepared to pull out your bread knife. Even regular size bagels protrude from the top, leaving that edge un-toasted. The problem isn't so much length (cutting longer bread slices in half isn't a big deal) as it is height. Even though it appears tall, the toaster just isn't deep enough to accommodate anything even slightly oversize. I occasionally had problems with thick items, too, though not as frequently. Another deficiency is the lack of a Bagel setting, a common feature on many comparable brands. The Bagel setting toasts the cut side of a bagel while leaving the exterior soft, and it's a feature I used frequently on my previous toaster. I would have much preferred it to the Bun Warmer feature on this model, which I never used. With regard to style and build quality, this is a great product, but as I said previously, if you're toasting needs go beyond basic store-bought sandwich bread, you'll want to look elsewhere.
