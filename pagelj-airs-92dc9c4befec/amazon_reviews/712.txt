Water Purification tablets
I remember using something like this when Boy Scout camping in the late 1960's and later in some of my military training. Thinking about going to the old pond on the property to try them on some pond water before I actually may be forced to use them. Feel better having them in the house "just in case." Going to add a bottle into my emergency kit for the vehicles.
