as advertised
This is a great walk around lens. I rarely print anything bigger than 8x10 so the issue of sharpness most reviewers bring up is for me a non-issue. Besides, who wants to carry and change lenses while walking around in an amusement park(Disneyland/California Adventure) or at the botanical garden? The only time I change lenses now is when I dabble in macro photography in the backyard. The description says "Macro Zoom Lens" but really is a not a true macro lens--it does offer a nice magnification ratio though.
