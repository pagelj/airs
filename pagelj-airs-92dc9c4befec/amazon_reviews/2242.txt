Great product
The Roku is a great product that is easy to use with a great price.  Simple set up and access to hundreds of movies and tv shows make cutting cable a no-brainer.  Make sure your Internet speed will support the Roku - if I remember correctly, at Roku. com, they help you determine the necessary speed.
