It Gets the Job Done
Country of Origin: Made In ChinaI needed this so I could use the audio feature on evernote.  It is a basic microphone and the cable that comes with it is long enough to place it comfortably when you need to use it.  Watch out for the Clip they provide though to secure the mike to clothes or other objects.  It can be somewhat loose on the mike and is hard to press open at times, but overall this product is perfect for basic Microphone needs.
