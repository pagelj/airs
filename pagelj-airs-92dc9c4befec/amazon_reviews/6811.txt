This coffee maker is awesome.  I had read some reviews that the coffee was not very hot - particularly on the single cup side.  It is so hot I have to let it cool off a bit before I can drink it. I have also not had any issues with the coffee not being strong enough as I had read in some reviews. No leaking problems, in fact absolutely no problems at all. I highly recommend this product.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
