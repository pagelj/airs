Very cool, and great photos!
The photos are great, and the high-rez is great. The software is a little tricky to use, but it's very nice once you get used to it.  We normally start finding our target area with low rez becuase it refreshes quickly, then move to high rez to take the photo.  The high rez is really slow (maybe 1 frame a second), which makes it difficult to move around and see your target. My son was amazed to see all the microprinting on money (try looking at the USA on the $20), that really excited him.
