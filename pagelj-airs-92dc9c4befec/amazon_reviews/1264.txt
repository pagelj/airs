Pretty good! im satisfied :)
this product was sent to me super fast! it took only 4 days for the screen protectors to get to my house! i bought the screen protectors from the seller "eTECH" and i think that this is an amazing deal.. it comes with 6 front protectors and 6 back protectors like it says and they are decent quality for only frickin 2$! thats awesome. they also come with wiping cloths and in total i was sent 6 of them. there CAN be bubbles when u apply them but if you apply the screen protectors on carefully and well, there arent any bubbles. i highly reccomend these, they do what they should do, they cost only 2$! and you will get alot so you dont have to repurchase new screen protectors for awhile.
