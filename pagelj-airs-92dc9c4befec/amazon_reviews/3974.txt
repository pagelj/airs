Video's are corrupted it the battery dies while you are shooting.
I found out the hard way about this camera and it HD video. It tried to shoot my child's soccer games and at 29 minutes it just stops.  When the battery dies. Not a problem right. You just replace with a fresh battery and start shooting again. However when you get home you will find that none of the videos will play if the battery dies or you turn the camera off without stopping the video first and waiting about 2 minutes before you turn the camera off. The reason for this is that the video is saved in an Apple . MOV file which is a wrapper around a audio and video stream.  If the battery dies while you are recording or you forget and turn the camera off without first stopping the video and waiting for the software to create the wrapper with all the metadata to finish and be written around the file then your record video . MOV file wrapper is corrupted and the file is worthless and will not play.  About half of my soccer videos will not play.  There is not any software on the market to fix this corrupted file and recreate the . MOV file wrapper.  Nikon does not support it with repair software to fix your corrupted . MOV  file.  Never buy this camera for the HD video.  It is OK for still pictures.  It will leave you angry and pissed once you lose a few of your precious videos.  Also it will stop when the video file size reaches 3,156,556  KB exactly 29 minutes.  They fail to mention that anywhere in the literature. It will also become over heated if you are shooting a game in the sun and just stop.
