I don't get the Apple craze
I ordered the iPhone 4 figuring I'd give Apple a shot after having a series of glitchy android phones. Unfortunately the iPhone 4 I received was one of the many that has an issue with the receiver and speaker due to the fact that the IC chips are not properly soldered onto the motherboard.  I looked online and literally hundreds of people have this issue.  Even better, while it is Apple's fault for improperly manufacturing these phones, that doesn't stop them from asking for hundreds of dollars to fix the problem.  Back to android phones for me.
