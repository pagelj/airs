Good quality, will do the job, but not the best.
The first thing I did when I received this item was to try it out, and immediately realized how solid the magnesium block was, while I eventually was able to get a pile scraped off it did take a few minutes.  The magnesium block is very solid and compared to some more expensive brands, where the magnesium is softer, you will have to work for it.  It may be beneficial to have a better tool to scrape it off because the small one will hurt your hand/fingers after a minute or two of scraping.  I still give it 4 stars because it did what it says it would, it scrapes into a pile and with the flint, will light up into a very hot pile of magnesium to help start a fire.  If you want something just in case and don't want to spend a lot of money then this will do the job, if you will be using something all the time and want an easier time making piles to ignite then I would probably get something more expensive with softer magnesium.
