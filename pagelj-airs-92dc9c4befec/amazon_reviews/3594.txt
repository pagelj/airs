Poor customer service
They told me that my claim was approved and sent me a shipping box.  They knew exactly what kind of tablet I have and that the glass was cracked.  They sent me notice of receipt and told me that it would be repaired within 5 days and shipped back which will take an additional 1-2 days.  They told me if there was a problem that would cause a delay, they would contact me.  On day 9, having not received it back and having not heard anything from them, I called and was told that they had me ship it to the wrong repair depot and they had to send it to another.  Long story short, I will be lucky if it is repaired and back to me within 3 weeks. I now wish that I would have saved the money that I used to pay for the warranty.  It would have covered nearly half of the cost of a second tablet which I could be using now while a local repair shop got my business to repair the broken one. I regret that I have purchased 4 of these plans including 2 that I transferred with electronic gifts.
