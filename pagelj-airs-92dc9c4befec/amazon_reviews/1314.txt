IF you loved the short story, your gonna hate the novel. Spoiler alert, kinda.
Read the short story and I really liked it. Thought I would give the novel a try. Some short stories should just stay that way. I am sure Mr. Carlson is a fine writer, but this novel is just horrible. Let's just say you land on a planet or moon and find life for the first time. Finally we are not alone!! What would be the first thing you do? Kill it and try to extract its DNA to potentially make super soliders ? Well then you would love this story. I really liked the characters, they lacked personality, empathy or any qualities you would like to find in real people to keep the story moving. Story moving? Good luck. I suggest reading in bed because this book works faster than nyquil. The only saving grace? I think I paid $1.99.
