Worth The Investment
If you've been getting by with the built-in flash of an EOS and think you're getting nice results, just wait until you get one of these.  All of a sudden those harsh flash pics look great due to how flexible a quality bounce flash is.  Couple this with a cheap soft-box attachment and your portraits using flash look incredible.  It's also great when using a large photo cube to take shots of objects.  Just aim the flash at the top of the inside of the cube and presto... instant professional results.  A must have if you're serious about great flash pics.
