Very good toaster oven
Compact size makes it fit nicely on  countertop.  Performs all functions quite well.  Actually toasts more evenly than my previous larger Cuisinart toaster oven.  Controls took a short time to get used to, but once mastered they work very well.  Would prefer that once you turn the oven off that the lights would go out but they continue blinking for about a minute.  Again, it's fine once you get used to it .  Have used almost all of its multi-functions and all perform very well.  Love the "keep warm" function.
