I bought this model for our office about 6 months ago.  Several people use it each day for toast or bagels.  Some use a high setting, some use a low one.  Everyone is satisfied with its performance.  You can lift the toast higher with the lever to get it out, and that works great.  (You should never have to turn it on its side or upside down as some reviews mentioned.)  The cancel button is very convenient if you need to use it.  The bagel setting (browns the inside of the slice while warming the outside) is great, too.  The cord is short, but works fine for our setup.  The crumb tray has not been a problem for us; we just remove it every now and then, wipe it off with a paper towel, and slide it back in.  With 6 months of the use in our office, this probably equates to a few years in a normal home.  Still going strong.  Great product-bought at Walmart for about $16.
