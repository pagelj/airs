good product /great price
i've been using the ptid-8920 for about a month now and so far so good. the unit was easy to install the video plays clear the sound is good(did'nt hook up amp for sub yet)and all other functions work good. no ipod control, but im using a4gig thumb for my music. i've used power acoustik amps in the past,so i know the brand stands out even with the hi-end names. overall a great budget friendly product with good features (4 stars for no ipod control)
