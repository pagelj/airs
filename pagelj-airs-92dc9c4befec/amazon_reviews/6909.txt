High-Yield?????
I am retired and do not print a lot of pages. When the initial cartridge was running low after about 8 months of use, I ordered this High-Yield OEM cartridge thinking I wouldn't need to replace it for a couple of years.  I installed it about two months ago and I am already getting the "Low Toner" message.  I have always believed in using OEM cartridges, but $46.98 seems too much to pay for such little use.  I will now try a compatible to see how long that lasts!
