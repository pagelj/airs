Good coffee maker
I am a fan of Krups having used other brands at my son's and family's house and used Krups for 10+ years.  I like that on this model Krups made the time more simple to set - on my older model I had to pull out the manual every time the electricity went off or the thing came uplugged but this one is much better.  It makes great coffee, very hot - like I like it - and has the 'aroma' button to give a stronger brew which I also like.  The stainless steel looks good.
