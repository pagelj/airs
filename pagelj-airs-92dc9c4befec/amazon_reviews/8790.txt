Better than expected and we expected the best for $240.
This monitor is worth every penny! I spent at least 2 months researching, reading every review, and going to the baby stores looking at the quality of the top 3 video monitors. After a long wait for my wife I finally made my choice of getting the Motorola with the 3.5" screen. We were not disappointed when it arrived it was as simple as plugging it in and it was up and running.  There is no interference what so ever with this unit. I lost signal at 427 yards down the street from my house, yes I used a range finder to check. There are a few reviews that complain about the buttons not being back lit but honestly there are 4 buttons on each side of the screen.  It's not a master remote for a home theater system if you can't learn 8 buttons and there locations don't buy it. The same goes for the volume it's very easy to go to in the menu one click of the menu button and it's the first item that comes up. Our little girl sleeps in a baby swing and there is no blur/distortion what so ever the day camera shows every detail and the night IR cam basically looks like a very good black and white cam. The pan and tilt work very well and the camera makes little to no sound when moving. The two way communication feature is great my German Sheppard was very confused when I used this feature from down the street. If you want a top of the line communication product purchase a unit made by a company that has been at the top since 1930.
