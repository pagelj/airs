Scarlet - Alpha Marked 1
Color me surprised! I really liked this one. I picked it up, not expecting too much, just a little entertainment in a short story. I loved this little novella- the main character, Scarlet was sassy and not shy about voicing her opinion. I like level-headed female characters!  The plot is thin, but characters are entertaining enough that you just don't care <grin>. I liked it and will look for more, hopefully full-length works by this author.
