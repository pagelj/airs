Hope you never need customer service
I have a Kindle Fire and like the machine.  But, I began having problems with it charging within a few months.  Then it just died.  Because it is dead, I cannot turn it on to see the serial number.  Customer Service was little or no help even when I merely asked to be able to send the darned thing back because I have purchased more than a single machine, (all of them are still in warranty period) but I cannot give them the serial number of this machine. I felt like I was talking to an idiot on the phone but the reality is I never received any customer service or way to send my machine back.  I was just given a phone number to call back again to talk with someone else.  CUSTOMER NO SERVICE is what I call it.
