Terrible!
I bought this item locally at Sears because it was on sale and since I have a Panasonic Plasma, the remotes were supposed to be compatible.  I wanted to upgrade from the old blu-ray to be able to stream netflix, but like other reviewers, I couldn't get the wi-fi to connect to the router.  I ended up running  a cat 5 cable across the house to connect the thing.  But, like other reviewers stated, the player is slow, it freezes up requiring it to be unplugged and plugged back in, if there is a DVD in the machine and you power up, it automatically plays the DVD and you can't stop it until all the intro stuff on the DVD plays and accepts input from the control.  it is a TERRIBLE product!! The software updates were done (thought it took three tries because the player would freeze) and even that didn't help any.  Stay far far away from this model!
