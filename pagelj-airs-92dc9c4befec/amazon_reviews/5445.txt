Otter Box poor quality
I was extremely disapointed with this product.  The first day the belt clip broke.  I decided not to return after releazing it was going to cost me additional money to return and I needed a case for a trip adn had no other solution.  So now I am only using it as a case not as a belt clip.  In addition the case does not lign up with the headphone port so you have to peel back the case to use a headphone.  Do not buy you will be dissapointed.  I rated it a 1 star only beacuse I could not rate it zero.
