Really surprising goodies
I bought the unit to play DIVX movies as recommended by Divx. com only to discover that it will NOT play Divx movies unless you register the unit with Divx, get their code, and then it will play purchased Divx movies. It will NOT play any converted or home created Divx movies, BUT, It will play everything else and thats a huge bonus. It's small as well so doesn't take up much space on the shelf.
