Very nice and very sweet!
Maid for the Billionaire was a very sweet book.  I downloaded it free so I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised at how developed Abby was as a character and how much I loved Dominic by the end of the book.  There are typos but nothing that deterred me from continuing my journey.  Abby and Dominic's time together spans over a very short period of time but in spite of that I could see why they fell in love with one another.  I laughed and smiled often while reading the book and the book took directions that were unexpected.  I enjoy an alpha male that reveals his weakness for his true love even as he tries not to.  The scenes where Dominic attempts to keep his true feelings at bay without success were hot and romantic.  I am impressed with the storytelling ability of Ruth Cardello.
