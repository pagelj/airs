Magnavox DVD Recorder/VCR Combo
Magnavox DVD Recorder/VCR Combo, HDMI 1080p Up-Conversion, No Tuner (Manufacturer Refurbished)Ordered this 3/12, and it arrived 3/14. Was boxed well (boxed in a box, with bubble wrap), and in good shape. Manual, Power and RCA-Audio/Video-S cables were in the box. I use my own audio/video cables. Setup was easy, and device menus were good. DVD and VCR work fine. This unit also accepts Digital Optical input. CONNECTIONS: Connect DirecTV satellite to TV/HDMI-1 via HDMI cable ; Connect DirecTV to DVD/VCR via RCA-Audio/Video-S; Connect DVD/VCR to TV/HDMI-2 via HDMI cable. Note: I would have used Component or HDMI cable from satellite to VCR/DVD, but DirecTV (not-DVR) box did not have these on the OUT section. The Magnavox hook-up was a breeze, and I did not have to deal with any COAX setup... Yaaaay! Our old Panasonic DVD/VHS stopped reading disks... Panasonic wanted $170 to fix or replace it. We bought this refurbished Magnavox ZV427MG9 for $132 (including $12 shipping). Looks and works like NEW, and a MANUAL was included! We will do some recordings later. Actually my wife will. She is the one who likes to record everything... TV, VHS to DVD, etc. So far though, all looks good. This has been an Excellent experience with Vendor "SeizeTheDay".
