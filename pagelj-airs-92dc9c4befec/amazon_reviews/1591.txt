Wife Loves the camera
Our camera broke prior to going on vacation.  My wife wanted a camera similar to the one we had.  It was a Canon Powershot SX120IS.  Your product worked the same and took the same size card. It even came with batteries.  My wife was very pleased with it.  She took a lot of pictures on our vacation.  It performed very well. The price was great, too.  It was delivered like you said it would be, also. Thank you very much.
