From an avid TV watcher and video game player
If you are looking for an HDMI cable for your cable box, Blue Ray player or Video gaming console, look no more. This is a very good deal and having taken it the second time from the same merchant, I recommend it to everyone. I personally feel cables should not cost much, and was taken aback at the price of HDMI cables at local stores, some for almost $50 more. This cable is sold by eforcity at Amazon for less than $3. I have compared the performance of the store cable with the Amazon cable side by side, and there is absolutely no visible difference between the two. Pricey cables could be so priced because of the company brand name and the packaging costs involved, but that doesn't give it the extra edge to spend more on them. I have a 40" inches HDTV and I use my cables for connecting my cable box and PS3 console to my TV.
