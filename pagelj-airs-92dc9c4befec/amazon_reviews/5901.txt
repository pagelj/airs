If only all products could be this good
This is one heavy duty, good looking, and very functional stand.  While setting it up I felt guilty for only paying 33 bucks on Amazon for this bad boy.  It's sturdier than $100+ stands I've purchased in the past. It fit my old Dell 20" monitors perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone.
