So far, works just like the original
So far, I'd say this purchase was a good decision.  I installed the replacement digitizer using the video on youtube in about an hour.  After installation, I would say that (so far) the screen looks and feels just like the original.  The most difficult part for me was removing the broken digitizer from the frame.  My broken digitizer had several cracks near the top and bottom of the screen and the hair dryer I used didn't seem to heat up and loosen the adhesive at all.  I had to use the provided flat head screw driver to separate small chips and slivers of the existing glass from the top and bottom frames.  Be ready for that part of the process to take longer than in the video.  Once that was done it was fairly simple.  Overall, I'm extremely happy to have only spent $10 and an hour of my time as opposed to shelling out $200 to the Apple store.  I'm not to worried about my warranty being voided - I believe that most problems that come up can be fixed with a reasonably priced part on Amazon and a good youtube how to video.
