Classic Haldeman
In anticipation of Forever Free, I re-read this classic.  It was just as fun today as when I first read it about a decade ago.  Haldeman has fun with his contribution to the interstellar war genre.  When he wrote The  Forever War he never expected that we would expose women to combat in the  near future.  However, his portrayal of women in the military of tomorrow  is getting closer to being realized.  While they don't yet have access to  combat roles, women work side by side in every other part of the US  Military.  Granted, the sexual themes are unlikely to occur in today's  world. This is a fun read, if a pessimistic commentary on the arbitrary way  that the military decides things.  Having just finished getting to know  William Mandella again, I am can't wait to find out how this reluctant hero  gets along 20 years (and a millenium) later.
