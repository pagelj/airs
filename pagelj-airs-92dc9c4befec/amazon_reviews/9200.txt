my husband bought these knives after seeing a review in Consumer Reports. We've had a jumble of assorted, not so great for the most part knives but didn't want to pay hundreds of $$$ for knives. So, $75? $80? What a deal. If we could change something we'd like the knife block to be slanted so the block can fit under the cabinets (knives must come out straight up). A mere quibble though for saving big $$$.
