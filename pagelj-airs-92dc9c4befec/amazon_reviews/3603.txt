A riveting story told with flair.
This is a five star book. That's not "five stars for effort", or "five stars for a cute story told with more enthusiasm than talent". Forging Zero is five stars for a riveting story told with flair. I've become quite non-judgmental about the cheap sci-fi on Amazon. I find it to be a distracting way to while away the time. Sometimes the story is good, sometimes the story is better than good. Sometimes the book will read like it should be returned to the author covered in red pen with "good try" scrawled at the bottom. Usually they seem like they need the attentions of a proof-reader, or an editor, and sometimes even the attentions of someone whose first language is English. I've been able to wring entertainment from almost all of the cheap books I buy on Amazon for my Kindle. Forging Zero stands head and shoulders over the overwhelming majority of books I've read in the last few years. Don't let the character focus fool you - there's action aplenty, and just because the author doesn't spend five pages explaining how anti-gravity works doesn't mean there aren't plenty of fun gadgets for the characters to play with. There is a lot of sci-fi about people in interesting situations. Forging Zero is about interesting people in interesting situations doing interesting things, and it is surprising how much of a difference that makes. Aspiring writers could do a lot worse than to read this book to see how to make characters the focus of your story rather than just a convenient hook on which to hang gadgets, heroism, and deus-ex-machinas.
