Ridiculously steamy short
This is an extremely short story, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in steam. Jamison does a great job setting up a likable personality and an enticing chance encounter. Some have complained about the implausibility of the scenario, but hey, it's fantasy fulfillment! For this reader, it did the job very well and I look forward to reading more by this author.
