I purchased this just before the Christmas holiday.  I must confess it isn't as good as our old faithful Solis Master 5000 but after 12 years of service, Solis finally was put to rest.  While no other coffee pot can replace it, Hamilton Beach Single Serve isn't bad.  In comparison to other brands I've tried, it is, in fact, pretty good.  I love that it makes one cup at a time so each cup is fresh tasting.  And it doesn't require the use of those tiny prepackaged cups that mess up the planet.
