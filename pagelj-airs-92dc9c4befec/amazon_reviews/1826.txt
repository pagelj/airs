nice bag but poor craftsmanship
I really like this bag as it is very practical and the right size for my needs.  However, on my first day of use, the zipper of one of the main compartments broke.  It appears that the zipper was not sewn properly as there are loose threads preventing it from working. There is another part (the clear id pocket in the front wallet section) that is also poorly sewn.  I didn't care about that as much since it is inside the bag, but after the zipper broke, I decided to return the bag.  Luckily, this happened early on and Amazon sent me a free return label and I'll receive a refund.  I'm disappointed since I like the bag, but glad that I'll receive a refund.
