Impeccable charger
There's simply nothing wrong with this charger. Unless you think it is unsightly, or the included power cord is too long, I cannot think of anything wrong with it. It works as advertised; it charges your rechargeable batteries, and rather quickly too. It has a rock solid construction despite what the other reviews say, and I have no doubt that it will outlast the useful life of many batteries.
