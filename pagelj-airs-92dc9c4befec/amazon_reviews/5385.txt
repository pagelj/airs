Buy this backpack!
I looked long and hard for a laptop backpack - I was tired of the standard laptop case that couldn't carry an apple or bottle of water.  I found this backpack at an office supply store but it was MUCH cheaper through Amazon... I'm a 46-year-old exec who does a lot of business travel, so I've put this pack through the ringer.  It's extremely sturdy and well-made (it's Swiss - what else would you expect), the zippers (all 11) are strong, and it's got some great features.  I like the quick-access pocket at the top for keys, cell, etc., as well as the internal flap that holds it upright on the floor.  The padding is excellent - very comfortable for that long haul across DFW!
