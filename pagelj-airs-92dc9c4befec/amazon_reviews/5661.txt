Great Camera for the Price.
Overall I am very, very satisfied with my Canon T3. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get into DSLR photography. The only small complaints I have...1. Viewfinder and LCD screen are a bit on the small side. It is fine for a while, but after a full day of shooting, I find it does become noticeable.2. Camera mode- Very long distance on the dial between the manual modes and the movie mode. Makes spur of the moment movies a little more challenging without missing the beginning of what is going on. I am pleased with the movie quality though.  Put on a lens in manual focus and shallow depth of field and it is quite pleasing.3.  Biggest regret- Wish I got the body only and got a 17-50mm f/2.8 in place of the kit lens.  The kit lens certainly isn't horrible.  I have just come to find that after using my other lenses, it just really lacks low light functionality and seems to really lack the "pop" that my other lenses have.  I find the images just look uninspiring no matter how well composed.  The images are sharp.  My complaint is more so based on color and contrast.  Obviously not having a larger aperture is a big part of the issue. Other than these few points, I can't say anything bad about this camera.  In fact, if I had to purchase a second body, I would be very likely to get another T3.  There are obviously much better cameras out there, but bang for the buck, this thing is pretty darn good.
