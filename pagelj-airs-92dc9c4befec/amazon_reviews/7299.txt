not so sure.... need help
yes, it's a nice phone. I'm not a techie and a previous blackberry fan. So, the first thing is I miss the blackberry features. One thing for sure, the case  bought for the phone is extremely difficult to take off. Not to mention the phone itself is difficult to openMy regular sim card did fit in no problem. Note the extremely helpful review posted December 24 2012. Downloaded whatsapp immediately as thats what all my friends an family use. But, one question. Isn't there a notification light thatwill come on when you get a message or call? If I don't happen to be near the phone when it rings or there's a message there's no way of knowing unless I actually wake up the phone and find the icon.  Thats inconvenientMaybe I can't find the setting that allows this and i wanted to pull the battery but now cant get the case off. Argh. Very frustrating
