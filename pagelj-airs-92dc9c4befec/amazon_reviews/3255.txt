Army Retro-Style Canvas Backpack
I wanted a washable, canvas-type backpack that wouldn't require a lot of maintenance or upkeep. As a fan of the `retro' military look and after reading several reviews regarding the `Rothco Army Star backpack', I took a chance and ordered. The under $40.00 price tag is also a keeper as some of the retro canvas items out there are outrageously over priced. I'm pleased with the backpack so far, as it seems to be ideal for a weekend/overnight bag. I've used it once and this is my impression so far:- There is one large interior section (cinched) with an additional small zippered pouch for ID cards or such, two smaller front pockets/pouches, and two smaller pockets to the sides.- There is no structure to the pack, so the more items you have in the bag the more structure and shape it will have and maintain.- The outer flap fasteners and cinch closure of the main section take some getting used to, but are relatively secure.- Unless you throw the bag off a bridge, nothing will fall out of it. The canvas and coverage for interior items is thick enough to protect from moderate rainfall and dirt. The straps are padded just enough to avoid cutting into a shoulder, and the carry handle works as a quick alternative. I'd recommend this as a weekender bag, or a day bag for someone that carries a little or a lot of equipment and or books back and forth to school or work and wants to have some fun with a classic military styled look.
