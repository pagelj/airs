Would give it 5 stars but after the suggested several minute burn in period during which it smells and emits smoke getting rid of whatever packing chemicals etc are used the plastic was extremely warm. I understand it's stated for "home use only" meaning it isn't supposed to be used repeatedly too many times and I wasn't concerned it was going to melt or catch fire as it didn't seem to be soft or deforming or anything hence why I'm giving it 4 stars but after running it even 3 or 4 times in a row the plastic near the top is untouchable due to heat and the plastic around the rest of it is noticeably warm/hot though not enough so that you are unable to hold it, I didn't run it more times than that so not sure what the limit is before the plastic around the top deforms. This may be standard for this kind of novelty toaster my only comparisons are commercial grade toasters I've used which remain relatively cool until they've been used dozens of times. Above is my only complaint though and if you just use it once like it's probably intended for then you'll never notice any real issue, as for the toasting itself that's fantastic it does both a great job toasting and a great job making concise easily distinguishable domo faces on bread. I was fairly surprised that if you use bread similar to the product photos the faces come out as well as they do in the product photos. I haven't tried it with darker breads yet but can only assume the darker the bread the less clear the face will be. I'll update this if that turns out to be incorrect.
