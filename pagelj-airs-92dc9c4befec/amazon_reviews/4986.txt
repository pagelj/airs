Great speedlight!
I love this speedlight! I bought it to go with my Canon t3i and it has exceeded my expectations. I like being able to use it as an off-camera flash -- it has added some creativity to my photos.  I was hesitant to spend this much as I am just getting into DSLR photography but I'm really glad I bit the bullet and bought it.
