Helps a lot on laptop, probably not needed for good LCDs.
Good tool.  Doesn't make that much difference in LCDs but made a huge difference on my Dell laptop. Look into the Microsoft Control Panel color applet if you use a docking station. OVERALL, seems to be a good device and helps give you some piece of mind.
