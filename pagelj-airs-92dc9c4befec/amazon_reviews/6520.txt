So glad I got this super point and shoot!
I have been getting Canon point and shoots for several years now. Unfortunately, my daughter recently broke the one I got last year, and I was using an older model as a temporary replacement, so I needed to invest in a new one sooner than I would have liked. Thankfully, this camera did not disappoint! I've only had it for a few days, but I am thrilled with the quality of the images so far. Inside or outside, it takes crisp, vibrant photos on the automatic setting, which is exactly what I wanted. It also takes great video. Some of the custom settings are really cool too, like the single color with black and white, the miniature effect, and the super slow motion video. I mostly take photos of my children, and for what I need it for (as an untrained but prolific photographer), this camera is perfect. So glad I got it!
