Good for the money.
This is probably the best toaster you'll find in this price range. My only complaint is that the elements on the center of the two slices don't seem to toast as well as the outside due to their position, but still a great deal.**Update 01/13/2013**We've been using this toaster for nearly 5 years and it's still going strong. Hard to be excited about a toaster, but anything that doesn't crap out on you after a few years is spectacular!
