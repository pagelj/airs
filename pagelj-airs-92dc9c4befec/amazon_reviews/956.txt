Great DVD player
Very easy and quick to install, the features are terrific, all easy to use and understand, the remote is terrific, larger lettering, easy to see, and use. The 3-d function works great. It is a bit rounded on the top of the unit, so if you want to stack something on it, not advisable or easy to do. I've had this unit a month, and it's great. I highly recommend this unit.
