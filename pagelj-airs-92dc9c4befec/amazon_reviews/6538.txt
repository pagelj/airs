Good quality depending on where it is used
I bought this webcam mainly to take pictures of myself as I log my weight loss weekly. The pics are great quality no complaints. On testing the video quality, it really is as good as the picture quality but does have faults. Now the faults i'm talking about are where you use this camera. I noticed on some websites that this webcam's quality would drop from it's advertised 720p down the the same choppy quality of my older webcam. Well i'll give it more credit than that, it does give better quality but there is no reason it should drop from 720p to what looks to be 360p. I guess it's just those websites, not the camera itself. I did pick this up on Amazon's gold box deal so I did get a good price at $23.99. I would honestly say to anyone that this camera is not worth the $40 listed currently. If you have $40 to spend, put in another 40 and you can get something WAY better.
