Buyer be Cautioned
PROS:I used Revo uninstaller to get rid of this product, hardware would not be recognized by Win 7 Pro, they say it's Windows at fault, sounds like Corel is at it again, anyone know someone who uses WordPerfect? When i emailed them about several set up and while using software errors, they said not our error code, when i sent them a copy of the screen snap showing they were wrong, they closed the help ticket. CONS:The recommendation to upgrade to Pro to solve issues, big dummy me, i tried, and now they won't refund the money i donated to them; oh well once bitten twice shy. GOOD NEWS:Look at the 2012 reviews for the top 2 software and hardware reviews, i now own one of each (yes, expensive but donate my time to other handicapped veterans) life is good can even do some minor movie editing. i hate to say this after i just ripped big time into Coral, but i had an old version of their product and upgraded to 5X and for minor to low intermidate editing works fine. Now that has been said, I use to own a small consulting firm where we we get free software to test, so it's not like we are new to this business. Roxio use to be called the swiss army knife in this software segement, now not stable, pretty box, though! FINALLY:So not the type that holds back, does anyone really want to know how we feel?
