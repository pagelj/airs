I have been looking for red items to add to my kitchen, to brighten up the room a bit.  When I saw this I really liked the description of it, and how it looked.  At one time I had a black Hamilton Beach coffeemaker and thought it was good quality, so this was a selling point for me for this red one.  It brews the coffee quite quickly, and I do have to say that my coffee these days tastes better than with my old coffee pots  I think it has to do with the spray feature that sprays hot water over the grounds. All my other coffee pots had a drip feature, and I do think the spray feature gets the best and most flavor out of the coffee.  The red is very bright and shiny.  I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone.
