swing away
having been out of baseball for years, getting back into the game in a men's senior league, i have completely deconstructed my slowpitch softball swing, and can pick up pitches and hit the ball the way i want to. for a young player, this book could be invaluable. i pick it up and reinforce what ive learned by reading sections again and again. plus ted williams' anticdotes as both a player and a manager are a fun way to relive the game the way it was.
