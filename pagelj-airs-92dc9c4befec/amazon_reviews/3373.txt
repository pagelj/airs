I love this game, but there's a problem.
This game is LOADS of fun! But, the problem with this game is that it's nearly impossible to complete. You have to use real money to get the large amounts of gems to buy ponies like Rarity and Rainbow Dash that are NEEDED to complete this game. Those poines are 2000 gems or more. That's over $250 of real money! Plus there is no comformation box when you buy gems. Little kids and accidentally spend loads of money on the credit card your device is connected to. A wonderful game but impossible to complete D:
