Fahrenheit 451 is a read rich with a delicious story and social commentary.  Guy Montag lives in a world made ironic because of the stark contrast to the way we wish our society was today.  Firemen don't keep people safe from fires, they bust into houses starting fires.  Scholars and professors live on the outside of society because of their love for books, philosophy, and sociology where in our world professors are on the inside and the ignorant majority are on the outside because of their lack of interest for the said disciplines. Literature is correctly portrayed by the leaders of Montag's twisted Earth as a tool that helps people keep in touch with their government and the reality of the world in which they live.  This realization by the government lead to a life in which people are encouraged to live `within' the television.  Not literally within the television, but completely enamored by a world of entertainment, visual images, and trivial information symbolized by the television.  I have a feeling this society isn't hooked to the Discovery Channel. Some go as far as to suggest that our world today is headed towards being like the world of Fahrenheit 451.  The explosion of television, fashion, cinema, video games, and the internet certainly suggest that our society is very much interested in entertainment, and probably at the expense of intuitive thought.  However entertainment is not a crime, as we all enjoy being entertained.  The publishing business is thriving, and so are newspapers, blogs, and other sources of text.  It will be interesting to see how far our Earth will progress towards the world of Fahrenheit 451.
