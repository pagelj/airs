Just disappointed.
I tried my best to love this laptop the best way I can but it just keeps giving me problems left and right. Ordered a replacement from amazon to correct the problems I had before with my first unit but that didn't solve a thing. The laptop makes an awful beeping sound booting it up and it keeps on beeping until I shut it off. It freezes causing me to reboot constantly, mouse jumps everywhere, shuts down unexpectedly, and leaving me confused why I payed over $1200 dollars for this laptop to work half way. What was HP thinking releasing a bad batch of these things and causing so many people problems in the process. Coming from someone who has bought HP products for years, I'm just shocked that things like these happens on top quality laptops from HP. I am not sure I will be buying another one of these in the near future. I give HP props for the nice sleek design and sound but other than that, i'm quite disappointed and will be getting a refund as soon as possible.
