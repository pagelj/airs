Stylish, Functional, Spacious, Durable
After thinking long and hard about whether this bag would be right for me, I ended up buying the Classic Messenger in Night Blue/Village Violet/Night Blue, size Small. I actually originally got a size Medium in another color, but this color combination and size was better suited to me and my needs. My biggest debate when buying was size. I originally bought a Medium size bag, but, after filling it and putting it on, I felt it looked way too large on me. I'm 5'8" and a rather larger woman, so I was surprised. It was a bit overpowering when on. It did, however, fit everything I would ever need. Still, I decided to downsize to the Small because it didn't overwhelm my body when I put it on. As long as I don't pack the bag to the gills, my 15-inch Macbook Pro fits in the main pocket. I can also pack all my gym clothes, including a towel, tennis shoes, and a few books for school without trouble. Small is enough. Trust me. Other than that, it's an extremely functional bag. All the little pockets can sometimes be annoying (where did I put my lotion again?), but they do keep me organized. The velcro closure is very very secure, and adding the clips makes me certain no one can break into my bag without me noticing. I do wish there were a handle on top of the bag, but it's not so much of an annoyance that it really bothers me. The strap is excellent, and fits across my body well, even though I'm a size 22 (this is something many plus size woman have to worry about). I also think this bag is very durable and will last me a very long time. It helps that I love this color combination completely! Altogether, it's a great bag with lots of pros. The only cons are minor annoyances (no top handle, loud velcro, almost too many pockets) that in no way harm the bag's functionality or my love of it. Truly, this is a great bag!
