Holey Moley 1500+ reviews - it must be good & it is!
Wow what a find - how did this one escape me for so long? Now here's what I have discovered more recently - book can have loads of reviews that are all positive and it becomes pretty apparent that almost all the reviews have been written by the author or their friends... Ms W...  I  have also discovered that many self published books are so riddled with grammatical and spelling mistakes that they are unreadable, which is really sad because some of these authors have great creatively and talent.  Fortunately Wool is the exception to these learnings. Amazingly the four and five star reviews are genuine and warranted.  This is a great read.  The book is well written, original, creative and engrossing.  I became swept up by the story line, saddened by the loss of some of my favorites and overjoyed by their triumphs.  For me that's the mark of a great author - one who creates a story and characters that the reader cares about. Truth be told this book is probably worth five stars, but there were a few aspects in the later part of the book that I felt stretched my supensIon of disbelief just a little too far.  I won't provide any spoilers let's just say one involved some young survivors and the other a water scene. If you are reading this review becaue you aren't sure about buying this book, not sure if you'll like it, maybe you are looking at some free downloads and thinking 'maybe I should just get the freebie'.  Stop!  With this book you will get your money's worth and more.  It is a great read.  I look forward to more by this author.
