This microwave was fine for two months and then quit working.  If you shut the door it would automatically turn on but was not heating and none of the buttons on the control panel would work. I love Amazon but will not buy an appliance here again.  They will only refund money 30 days from purchase and this microwave was discontinued so the manufacturer did nothing either. The worst part has been the Oster customer service.  They insisted the model number WRITTEN ON THE MICROWAVE AND MANUAL did not exist.  I was told for weeks that they would have an answer in 48 hours, only to be brushed off when I called in 48 hours.  Even the manager did nothing to resolve the case.  I spent $85 on this microwave and they refused to refund or even replace the unit.  Defective microwave, awful customer service.
