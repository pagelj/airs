waffle iron review
The Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker works great!  I really like the way you can dial in just how brown you want your waffles.  The item clicks when the indicator changes colors so that you don't even have to look at it to know when the waffles are done.  I would definitely recommend this product.
