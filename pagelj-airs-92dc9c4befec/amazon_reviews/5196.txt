good quality, but could be a bit bigger
Bag is as advertised, looks nice, and feels well made.  My only complaint is that it could have been made a bit wider, as it really only has room for the laptop and not much else.  If that is all you want it for, then this is a nice bag.  If you intend to keep anything else in there with the laptop, it will be a tight fit.
