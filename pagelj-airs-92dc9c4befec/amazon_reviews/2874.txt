The Long Earth
This book was entertainingly written with a definite Pratchett flavor to the characters. The idea behind the story is clever enough, because it takes the relatively simple concept of the parallel universe and adds a nice twist. To be honest though, the story seemed to go on for a bit long, with some unnecessary (unless they relate to future installments?) meanderings in the characters journey. The ending was vaguely done and mildly unsatisfying, but assuming a follow on novel I guess it worked.
