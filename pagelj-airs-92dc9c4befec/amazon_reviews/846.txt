Another Dud from Nikon!
I've used Nikon cameras for decades but it looks like this is the end of the road. The autofocus does not work and I've returned the camera for service and it still doesn't work. I took it outside to shoot sample pictures and the camera died. I've tried recharging it but still no luck. If I am doing something wrong, shouldn't it be obvious on a point and shoot? My latest communication from Nikon support provided some suggestions that are a little confusing but would be worth trying if only the camera would power on. My previous Coolpix digital had a bad start too. I had to return it twice but finally they fixed it and it worked well for a couple of years. Then it started having problems on full zoom, and since it's old it doesn't seem worth having repaired. This camera has some desirable features but it's been very frustrating. While it was working, I got the manual focus to work in Sports mode and got some good photos, but changing the focus manually requires using a tiny on-screen indicator that's just a line with very few marks to guide you. It was fine as long as I needed to shoot at infinity but was a pain to use at other distances. A point and shoot should be easy to use.
