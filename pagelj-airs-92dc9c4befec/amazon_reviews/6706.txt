beware of this product
I had my samsung bd9000 for about a year when an update prompt came up on the home screen. Not thinking any harm would come I clicked the update now box. That was the last time my blue ray player ever worked. I tried all the tricks and tips that others online had advised but to no avail. I finally contacted Samsung and told them about my issue. They wanted 80$ just to look at it and refused to help before the 80$. I declined.
