The best!
My daughter fell in love with the bookbag as soon as it arrived! Going into junior high she is required to carry alot of books because of the switching if classes. This bag has done more than expected! It's convenient comfortable extremely spacious! I plan to buy a second one in case it's not in the market in the future.
