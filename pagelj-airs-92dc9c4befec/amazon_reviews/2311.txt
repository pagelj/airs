Finally, a solution!
My dog (a year and a half foxhound/labrador mix that I adopted a month ago) has developed severe separation anxiety, and according to Cesar Milan one of the solutions is to give him more exercise before I leave in the morning. Since a two hour walk before the hour of seven seemed a little excessive, I began looking for other answers to this dilemma. The suggestion of a doggie backpack with filled water bottles or other weighted material (not too much, but enough to make the dog work harder) was presented to me. I loved the idea of giving my dog the workout he deserves without completely tiring myself out before a day at work to do it, and also the idea of him being able to carry his own water, food, toys, and treats on long hikes and camping trips once the summer months roll around. Therefore I began scouring Amazon for quality packs that weren't too overpriced. I was shocked to see some dog packs that cost more than the backpack I carried in college, but this one seemed to be of quality construction and was affordable to boot (and eligible for Amazon Prime shipping, which is a major bonus). I am pleased to tell you that this product was everything I was hoping for and more. The straps are fully adjustable, so I got the perfect fit for my dog after only a couple of adjustments. You can even adjust where the saddlebags fall on the dog's flanks, so the pack can fit a wide range of dogs. The materials are also very high quality and I can tell that this was designed to be an item that gets ample use throughout its lifetime. I managed to squeeze two 32 oz Nalgene bottles, filled with water for weight, into the saddle bags, and I can't believe the change in my dog. He is calmer and more submissive, and his separation anxiety is already decreased. Bottom line: if you are looking for a quality pack for your medium to large sized dog, BUY THIS ONE! The price is right and the quality is great!
