STAY AWAY from this lens
I've never had such a bad experience with a lens. I'd borrowed one from a friend to check it out, and it performed beautifully. I bought my own, and couldn't for the life of me reproduce what I'd seen with the (theoretically identical) version from my friend. The lens is unusably soft beyond 200mm. I brought the lens to France with me, assuming all was well, and discovered this fact. I sent (at great expense) the lens to Nikon in NY to have it serviced. They lost the paperwork and sent the lens back to me, once again at great expense to me because they mucked up the customs forms. It was accompanied by a piece of paper: this lens performs according to factory specifications. I got in touch with them and got them to agree to check it again, at their expense (it's under warranty). Back it went to NY, and this time I made sure they contacted me before doing anything. They said, once again, that the lens was in perfect shape, and asked me to send my camera (!) to see if this was why the RAW files I'd sent were so soft. I refused, naturally. I had my assistant shoot some test shots with a different camera, same settings, and got exactly the same results. Lovely: I'm stuck with a brand new but useless lens. No point in trying to have it serviced; apparently Nikon thinks that this softness is normal. So, for what it's worth, either 1) make sure you test this lens when you get it, and return it if it's soft or 2) don't buy it at all.
