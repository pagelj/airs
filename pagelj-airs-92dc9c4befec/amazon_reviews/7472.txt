LOVEmyPICSgottaLOVEtheCAMERA
I am a person that loves to take good quality photos this camera was very small for me to hold and wasn't as a easy use as i thought it would be. This is a very good camera for someone that only wants to use it once in a while. I will say that once you get the hang how it takes pictures the quality is really good.
