What a great value and security too!
There are many choices for external storage but I wanted something small, only a single USB cable instead of two, and with an encryption option. I don't use this as primary storage but as a backup. It is also small and light to stay in my briefcase since my SSD drive in my laptop isn't big enough to hold every single photo and movie that I own in case I need access. So if this drive is lost or stolen, I don't stress out over it because the drive can't be unlocked without a password. I've tested its mounting password on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Mac machines and it works on the fly in each environment without pre-installing any software. In other words, even on a machine which has never seen this drive, just plug it into a USB port and launch the unlock app that appears.
