24FPS HD video!? WOW I like it so far!
My order arrived in good order. What a cute little camera! I have taken about 40ish photos and a couple of videos. The controls are very easy to use and the function menus are pretty intuitive. The anti-shake stabilization is pretty impressive! If you need native 24FPS video, guess what! This camera shoots HD video @ 24 FPS! How cool is that! I put an 8GB SDHC card in and it will hold ~1400 18:9 photos or 10+min of video. this would be a great back packing camera. It's late now, I'll follow up after I've had a chance to live with the camera for a while.
