Worth the Extra Money
Our old toaster oven finally bit the dust, so I researched a replacement.  This Cuisinart was a bit more expensive than others that I was considering, but after reading the existing reviews I decided to give it a try.  Some of my reasons for deciding on this model were:  optional convection baking, large interior, and stainless steel throughout.  The convection baking mode shaves time off preperation of many items while also letting you reduce the cooking temperature.  The pan is large enough to cook a medium frozen pizza, without having to wait for a full size oven to reach temperature.  Besides the time savings there is also the power savings. There are two things about this product that I would change.  First, the baking pan supplied is subject to significant torsion (twisting) if baking for an extended period of time.  This has not really bothered me much (and the pan returns to normal flat shape when cooled) but I suspect that it would make baking something like brownie batter a problem.  The second item I actually consider a design deficiency.  There is a timer built into the unit, but it only buzzes when time has expired and will not turn the cooking elements off.  This was a surprise to me, as our previous toaster oven's timer did turn off the power. Even with these couple of short comings, this is an outstanding appliance that I would highly recommend it to anyone.
