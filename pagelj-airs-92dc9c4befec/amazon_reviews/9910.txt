Just What I was Looking For!
I have been in the market for a great point and shoot for some time! I have 2 little boys (age 2 and 7months) and priority for me was being able to capture them! It took some time to figure out how to use all the features (probably would have helped if I read the manual but I just have not had time) but considering I have just been playing around with settings, it is pretty user friendly! I love that there is an easy auto setting for when I need to be quick capturing a moment, but I also love that it has many customisable settings! I can choose shutter speed and aperture, change the white balance, etc.! I also love the quiet setting, it makes no noise or flashes at all, so I can sneak up on the boys during naps and take pictures without waking them! Overall, if you need something easy, with great quality images that allows you to take pictures of a wide range of things, this is the camera for you!!!
