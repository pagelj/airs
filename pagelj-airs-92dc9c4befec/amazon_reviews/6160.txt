My first Steamvac I gave away when I moved to my last roomate. She needed it to keep up with the cats she has and it has done a superb job. I got this one for my new place and I see there are a few updates but nothing huge, more color changes. It took my a little while to understand how to use it but now I can pull it out and hit a rug or carpet in just a couple of seconds. I always make sure I empty and clean the dirty water container after every use. That way I don't have to worry about it starting to smell or being full when I need to use it. The upholstery brush has worked great on my car seats and my sofas over the years as well. If I went the professional route everytime I clean I'm sure it would cost me thousands more compared to purchasing this bad boy. I have noticed that the professional cleaners can get things a little cleaner but I have an expectation of having that anyways. I always tell people that borrow it this is not magic but will clean what's there. If there's a stain this might help but there's a chance it won't pull the stain out. I've never had anyone say they were dissapointed with the results that they saw after use. I would purchase another one of these in a heartbeat.
