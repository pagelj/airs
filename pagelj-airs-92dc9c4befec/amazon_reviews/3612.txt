grab and go
I am currently traveling around Europe and have found that this is a must need for all travelers. I was in a crowded London underground tube stop and felt someone tug at my camera bag. Thankfully the strap on bag held. That night I went home and bought this bag. Since then I have traveled around quite a bit and have felt confident in the strength of the bag. The pockets inside are adjustable and can easily hold a bottle of water if needed. The ONLY reason why I didn't rate this bag with 5 stars is because I feel the bag needs a lock. Call it paranoia, but in Europe some people will steel anything you have on you, it doesn't matter if it's in your pocket or not. I am using a TSA (airport luggage lock) lock and it has been working great. I hope this helps your decission.
