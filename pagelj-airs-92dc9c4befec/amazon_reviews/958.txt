Pretty good little player- pleasantly surprised
We purchased this about 8 months ago to occupy our toddler on an airplane trip. Since then it's gotten TONS of use, and we are very happy with it. We even have used it as our main dvd player when our big one died- the included video output wires make it easy to hook up to the TV.  (Or unhook and hand to our toddler to watch quietly when we've had enough of Dora blaring from the TV- pretty cool. )The battery life works fine for us- our 2 year old will get bored of it before the battery dies, so it's sufficient. My only complaint (and it's a minor one) is that strapping it to a headrest makes sitting in the front seat uncomfortable becuase the buckles hit you right at the back of the head.  But it's not the end of the world, and for long car trips I'll put up with a little discomfort to have a happy travelling kid.
