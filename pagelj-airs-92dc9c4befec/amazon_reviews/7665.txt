Coffee?  Too funny!
This quick read was a double shot of espresso in the romance department.  If you want to understand the coffee references, you will have to read the book.  With this being a quick read (in an afternoon), I must admit that the storyline was a bit anti-climatic.  I was expecting something more profound to happen.  It is free so go ahead and indulge in some heavy romance without too much conflict. P. S.  If every man were this devoted to his woman, there would be heaven on earth!
