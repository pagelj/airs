AN AMAZING CAMERA!!!!!
I would like to say that I'm an extremely picky person when it comes to cameras. I love taking great pictures and over the years I had many cameras. I purchased and returned so many cameras I lost count. I hate when you buy a camera and the reviews are OUTSTANDING and then you take it for a ride in different occasions and environments only to be disappointed by the end results. So with that said I, I was looking for a water camera and after reading many reviews I decided to buy this camera from my nearest Walmart. I thought, here is going to be another camera with great reviews that's going to go back in few weeks. I WAS SO AMAZED OF THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES, I WENT BACK A WEEK LATER AND PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO THE FIRST,I WANTED TO MAY SURE I WILL HAVE ONE MORE AS A BACK UP:):):) I HAD NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE WITH ANY OTHER CAMERA, EVER! Now,keep in mind that I'm not easily impressed when it comes to cameras, but this one blew my mind. Let's be clear, this is NOT a great camera for all occasions and I didn't intend to use as such from the beginning, but for a water camera THIS CAMERA IS THE BEST, HANDS DOWN! I LOVE IT!!! The colors are vibrant, quality it's outstanding + the price it's awesome. I had it for the past 3 summers and I captured so many great moments of my kids at the pool, recorded many videos,and so far I had not one problem with this camera. Few things I would like to mention:1. when you review your video on the camera the sound DOES NOT WORK, ONLY WHEN YOU VIEW IT ON YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER DEVICE YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND.2. the screen it's a bit small but believe me you'll love how the pictures look on a bigger screen.2. I love the idea or rechargeable batteries, I bought few extra batteries and a charger and have them with me at all times.3. make sure you take out the batteries when you don't use the camera for long periods of time. IF YOU'RE HESITANT ABOUT PURCHASING THIS CAMERA, TAKE IT FROM A PICKY PERSON: YOU'LL LOVE IT, AND IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU'LL LOVE IT EVEN MORE. I WAS STOPPED SO MANY TIMES AND ASKED ABOUT IT. NOT ONLY THAT I WAS IMPRESSED, BUT MY FRIENDS WERE IMPRESSED TOO, THEY ALL THANKED ME FOR CAPTURING SUCH GREAT MOMENTS ON CAMERA... SINCE I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THE CAMERA IN THE WATER :) I'LL TRY TO SEE IF I CAN UPLOAD SOME PICTURES. P. S. few month ago my everyday point-and-shoot camera broke and I started searching for another camera to replace my broken one. I purchased two cameras that I'm trying out right now, bought and returned 3 others so far... IF THAT'S NOT A PICKY PERSON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER WORD WILL DESCRIBE ME BETTER. So far I think I found a winner: PANASONIC DMC-ZS19! (I BOUGHT THE ZS19 AND ZS20 AND SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE ZS 19 IS BETTER, I MIGHT WRITE A REVIEW ON THAT TOO) I JUST MENTIONED ALL THIS TO SHOW YOU THAT I DON'T JUST BUY ANY CAMERA UNLESS I TEST IT MYSELF. HOPE THIS HELPS :)
