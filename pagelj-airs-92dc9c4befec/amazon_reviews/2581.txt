Indoor grilling at its best
Rated this as a five star because we have not found anything about it that we would change.  I was very skeptical at first given our experience with the Foreman grill.  But the ability to "float" the the top allows for even grilling across the food.  Very nice.  Also, the versatility of using it as a grill or a griddle or both at the same time is really great.  We can cook pancakes at the same time as cooking our turkey bacon.  We can cook the salmon at the same time we are grilling the asparagus.  And so on.  Clean up is easy.  Removable plates wash up quickly.  It seems like the quality of this model is better than others in the past.  We would highly recommend this product as a great addition to the kitchen.
