Good for streaming TV. Poor for watching videos form home network or NAS.
I got this and the KDLINKS HD700 primarily for one thing. I have lots of videos on my home network and wanted to find a way to view them with the family on our main tv downstairs. Bottom line - this device is good to very good for streaming internet tv. Lots of channel selections, easy to use menus and the streaming rate is fine on wireless. For those interested in JUST internet tv streaming I would rate this 4-5 stars. For those who want a device for watching your network content - (I store mine on a home server and a NAS), forget this and look at the KDLINKS HD700. The stream rate over the network was horrible with this product despite my fast switches and big pipes. Most video was unwatchable since I have large files - 10-15gb soccer games in full HD. When it didn't stutter and choke, it stopped altogether. This was after waiting 10-15 minutes or more for the video to load in the first place, and looking at a blank screen. The Roku didn't seem to have a workable cache for large files. I gave up. The KDLINKS 700 however worked like a charm. The menus weren't great, and it helps if you have some familiarity with networking or setting up an xbox at least, but the videos on the HD700 streamed flawlessly and it did a great job of adjusting for network bandwidth. If you don't care about NAS or network viewing and just want to stream internet tv. This is a good and user friendly choice. If you want to watch the terabytes of video you have on your network without tearing your hair out, forget this and look at the HD700.
