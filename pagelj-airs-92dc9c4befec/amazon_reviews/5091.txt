IT'S GOOD
I use this phone for like a month , and finally I decide to use my review . It looks good to me more than the itouch , and it looks good really . Mostly to me the phone is useful , but it has too many apps already inside that I cannot delete !! And somnetimes it will die when I was downloading video , and I cannot leave the page whether I press the start button or go to the home page . I can easily get know all the functions of the phone , the shipping is fast . Mostly I like everything of this phone , but if the seller can give us two batteries in the box that would be much better Y(^_^)Y
