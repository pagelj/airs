Great but maybe could be a bit bigger
The backpack is made of great material, the craftsmanship is excellent. The one and only thing that i would change is that it is not very large. If you are using this solely for you laptop and supplies then definitely buy, but if you are using it as a book bag for school be aware that you will NOT be able to hold more than a couple text books of medium size. I give it five starts because it is exactly what it is advertised as. Great bag!
