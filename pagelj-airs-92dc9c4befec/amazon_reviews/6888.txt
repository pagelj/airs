An amazing read that really nails so many details.
So many five star ratings have been given I don't know if there are any more details I can add. I just needed to say that this is one of the best books I've read in years. It nails so many little details about how it feels to be in basic training and serving with a people you often would prefer not to be around. My only regret is that there isn't a sequel ready to read immediately. I hope this author writes quickly!
