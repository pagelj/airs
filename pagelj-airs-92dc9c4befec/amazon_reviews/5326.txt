I liked the idea of a toaster and toaster oven all-in-one, but this is the worst toaster of all time.  The toaster oven is small but worked okay before it broke after 18 months.  Now I'm left with a "toaster" that puts a burned streak in the center of the bread while the edges remain untouched by heat.  What a waste of money -- buyer beware.
