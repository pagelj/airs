Sold as NEW - but not!!
The EVO phone is fine.  I bought it for my wife as new.  About 6 weeks after buying it, it would not charge.  I bought a new battery, but that would not do the trick.  I took it to a Sprint store, and they said the charging port was not working.  I guess this has been a problem with theEVO phones, so they switched it out with a reconditioned phone at no charge.  The Sprint rep showed me several things that indicated that IT WAS NOT NEW!!!.  So, I AM HAPPY WITH THE PHONE, BUT NOT THE SELLER!
