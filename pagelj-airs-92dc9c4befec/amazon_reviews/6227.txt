I want to cut the cord to cable, so I thought Roku would be the way to go. I was excited to set it up when it arrived. However, when I turned it on, it severely slowed my home Internet connection (Comcast).  I turned it off and tried again a few days later and it did the same thing.  I'll try Apple TV or Boxee, I think. Well, I should add that the user interface was very nice, so no complaints about that.  I have video options with my DVR but I do not like the UI, which is why I'm examining other options.
