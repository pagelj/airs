Such a small investment to make life so much easier!
I don't know how we lived without Roku for this longâ€¦ We've had no Cable for years now, streaming all of our movies and TV shows, and all these years I've been frustrated with the experience almost every time. We pay for Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime, but all of those have serious problems playing in a web browser. Hulu used to have a desktop client for Mac, but they killed it. The web version is often unusable on my old Mac mini, as it runs with a delay of several seconds. Netflix makes me install a new version of Silverlight every time I run it, and then still stutters almost every time. Amazon will not let me play HD content on my computer. That's where Roku comes in. It just works. And it's so simple to use -- I can even control it from my iPhone or Kindle and have the advantage of a full keyboard. Everything is in HD and everything so far has been playing very smoothly. Setting it up was a breeze as well. Hats off to the Roku team!
