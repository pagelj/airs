Slots not wide enough
My toaster arrived in perfect condition but I couldn't use it even once. The slots didn't accept the bread slices (Nature's Pride brand) and that's why I had to return mine. I have had a Krups toaster for about 9 years and thought of replacing it because it doesn't toast evenly sometime. But the model that I have (it is not a very high end model though) has slots that accept different brands of bread available in the market and that's why I ordered a new Krups toaster. In general, I am impressed with the quality of Krups appliances as I own some of them. They provide good design and practical features  but it seems this model was created for some other countries (where bread size may be standard unlike USA).
