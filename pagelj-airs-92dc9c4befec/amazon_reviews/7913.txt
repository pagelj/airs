Sony Camera pricelss!
Love this camera. Zeiss lenz is the best. So many ways to get best results. If you like to ajust, you'll like this camera. I take photos of my art work (pictures), large and small. Lighting is never a problem. Oh, I almost forgot to say going from one thing to another isn't quick like a bunny so some people reviewed it who were impatient. Read the reivews and you'll see what I mean. I took pictures all the way through the Vatican Museum in Rome and they were excellent.
