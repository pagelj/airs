GREAT backpack for my 7th grader!!!!
This backpack is the BEST one I have purchassed to date!  My son is in mid. school and they do not have lockers.  EVERYTHING goes in his backpack it weighs 30-50 pds. at least every day.  I was buying a backpack for him every 3-5 mths because the zipper broke or straps or whatever.  He has had this about 7 mths and I must say it is in the same shape as when I got it in the mail (well it is dirty full of old gum rappers etc...)  I am VERY impressed with it and IF or WHEN it does break I will buy it again for him for sure!!!!!  I did see some rewiews about the straps being stiff and hurting.  I personal thought they were stiff/hard but my son NEVER said a word about it.  This is the only negitive thing I can say about it but he has no bad stuff to say and that is all that matters, it is his!!!!  Oh it also hold TONS of stuff!!! It is the best purchass I have made!
