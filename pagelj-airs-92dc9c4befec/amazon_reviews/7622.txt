Excellent USB Microscope
This microscope worked without any effort except installing the application software.  You have a choice of several resolutions, but I always select the highest resolution. Bitmap appears to be the default file type, but you can save it as a jpg image file easily.  The thing that I don't like about it is the microscope stand. It is attractive and works to some degree, but you really cannot adjust it much beyond the way it is pictured on this web page. Even though this USB microscope works, I do sincerely regret buying it versus a real microscope for not much little extra money.  This is the one I wish I had purchased:  AmScope 40X-1000X LED Cordless All-Metal Framework Full-Glass Optical Lens Student Biological Compound Microscope + Digital Camera USB Imager. For another $40 I could have gotten a professional microscope without the handicap of the microscope stand on this unit. And there is a huge difference in capability for a mere $40. But this microscope does function as advertised and I'm stuck with it. It is manual focus, but seems to focus fairly easily.  I cannot determine how to change the magnification. It seems to be a combination of a magnification and focus ring. The magnification seems to range from 35X to 55X. Depth of field seems to be reasonably good. I have no idea how they claim 200X. That must be some marketing gimmick.
