Quick Convenient GREAT
This is our second purchase - got the white Paula Dean for our RV and liked it so much decided we wanted for house too.  Got the black for house to coordinate with stainless.  This is a little tricky to get right in terms of perfect sandwich - but keep trying - it's worth it.  Great breakfast!
