Versatile Cover
This cover had all the elements I wanted in a case: (1) Hard cover, (2) option to fold it completely back, (3) hand strap, (4) strap to keep it open/closed, and (5) the ability to prop it into a standing position. Though it was a few extra bucks I think it was worth it since I was able to get everything I wanted (I got it on sale for $38). The hand strap has been the most useful feature since I will walk on the treadmill and play games -and the hand strap allows me to keep it secure in my one hand and play with the other. The prop up feature is convenient for when I want to lay down and watch videos. This case also holds the Fire in securely. All around a good cover. (And at the time I bought this it was the only one with the hand strap feature; not sure if there are other otpions on the market now).
