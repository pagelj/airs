Great TV Series
This started out as a great idea and then went south with "What?"  After several seasons I quit watching it.  Somebody should tell Hollywood that cocaine is not making a better script... it makes an ugly mess.  At any rate I loved watching Eureka, until it went somewhere I just didn't want to go.  First Season was best. Would like to see more of "Carter"!!!
