This seems like a simple story, that of a child who goes to war. But all wars are fight by the youth. While the old send them off. This is Cards best book, one I can always find time to read. It deserves a place on every science fiction readers kindle, or bookshelf. I'm excited about the film and hope it will be half as good as this book. If you haven't read it, do your mind a favor and do so. I'll say nothing else because spoiling this book four a first time reader would be a sin.
