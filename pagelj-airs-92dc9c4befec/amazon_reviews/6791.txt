Canon ELPH 100
I purchased this camera for my daughter. The name will tell it all. Light weight, easy to use and very clear pictures. The only regret I have that this camera would just use regular AA batteries like Duracell or any regular Alkaline batteries. The bottom line is a heck of a camera. Again, so happy I got it from amazon. com. keep up the good work amazon. com. Amazon is the best. Thanks
