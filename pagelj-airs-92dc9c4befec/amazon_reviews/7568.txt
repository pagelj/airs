Bought it for the novelty of it- It looks creepy.
Actual functioning gas mask with removable filter cassette. Easily achieves air tight seal for adult wearer. Fully adjustable for comfort and seal. Can wear for extended period without discomfort. Goes on and comes off similarly to putting on a baseball cap. Hold the rear straps low on the back of your head, and draw the mask forward and down towards your chin.
