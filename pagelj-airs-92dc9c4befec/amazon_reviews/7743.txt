Incredible machine
This purchase was one of the smartest I have made. I started years ago with a Sony CRT projector that cost $6000. It was replaced when it died by a Vidicron projector costing $7000. This was the worst purchase of my life. Poor company support, it died with less than 300 hrs on the bulb and off warranty. The Epson has a wonderful picture both high definition, and in the 3D mode. It is very user friendly. It's features,quality, and ease of use relative to it's price speak for itself. I highly recommend.
