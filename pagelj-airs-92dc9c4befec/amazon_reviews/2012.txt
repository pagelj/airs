Didn't Make It Half Way Thorugh
Love the Kindle Freebies and have found quite a few authors that way - but this is NOT one of them. I am a fan of Category Romances in general; I find them very comforting escapism. This means that I am more than willing to suspend disbelief in certain plot lines that would bewilder readers that are new to the format. But the predatory thoughts and behavior of the hero in the workplace with a dependent employee was so unacceptable, I just couldn't keep reading. I will not be trying anything else by this author.
