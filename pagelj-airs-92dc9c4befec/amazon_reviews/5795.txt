Laptop came damaged, awful customer service, laptop is good, once fixed
I ordered this product December 21, 2012 with 2-Day shipping in order to recieve it by Christmas as it was a gift for my girlfriend. Amazon ended up canceling my order without telling me and I didn't find out until I checked the shipping status on Dec. 23. After almost 2 hours on the phone and speaking to three levels of customer service managers, Amazon re-ordered my product, gave me a discount and promised it would be delivered by Dec 26. After Christmas had gone by I was informed that it wouldn't be delivered until the 27th. I again had to spend an hour on the phone to have the package rerouted since I was only visiting my family for Christmas and would be returning home the 27th. Amazon offered me a $30 amazon credit which I accepted but only was granted $10. We FINALLY got the laptop at home on the 27th and upon opening it, the laptop was inoperable, the LCD was non functioning. We immediately called Amazon and Dell and they said it could be fixed by a dell technician within 24-48 hours. As you can probably guess, this also didn't happen! After many phone calls and emails, we finally got the laptop fixed January 4, 2013. The laptop works fine and my girlfriend is happy but this was am experience I will never forget, I know this isn't the norm but it seems like everything that could go wrong did, and Amazon seemed to believe it was no fault of their own! Bottom line: Good laptop especially for a student, good battery life, but go ahead and buy it at Best Buy so you don't have to wait, or deal with nonfunctional laptops!
