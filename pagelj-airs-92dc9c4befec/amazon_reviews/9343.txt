I have this Eureka Maxima blue model #4704 and i have the sam eproblem as reported before, when I vacuum the vent that's in the front of the vacuum actually blows air and pushes dust away ahead of the vacuum. Before I can pick it up, the things are all flying around all over the place. It's powerful and lightweight though.
