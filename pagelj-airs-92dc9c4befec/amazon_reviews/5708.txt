I purchased a set of these knives for my mother who had nothing but misc. junk.  She loves them, I loved them.  I have a very expensive set of knives and find the Ginsu Chikara set super value for the money.  I was so happy with the set I gave my Mom, I bought a set for my boyfriend.  He loves them also.  Very sharp
