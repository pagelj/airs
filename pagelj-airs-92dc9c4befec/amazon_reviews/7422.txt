Product arrived in a timely fashion and this thing really picks up dirt and you can see it in the canister.  As I was warned in a Sears store when looking at this earlier, the hose is very stiff and needs stretching for a while to be easier to use.  It would also be better if I didn't have to go out and spend a fortune on new attachments.  But this thing really sucks ;-)
