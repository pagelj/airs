Blurry photos and pixelated noise are the downfall of this camera
We bought this camera after testing it out at Best Buy on several weekend visits and absolutely loved the small size, 3.0 inch LCD display, on-screen menu, and 4x optical zoom of the camera. However, the blurry photos are real downside to this camera. Our last camera was a 5MP Canon PowerShot A95 point and shoot that we got back in 2005 and it by far takes much better pictures. Despite listing image stabilization as a feature of the Cybershot w-230, you have to keep your hands absolutely still. I mean really still in order to avoid blurry photos. It is also difficult to capture clear pictures of movement even when you adjust the settings. Also, this camera does a poor job of taking photos in moderate to low light and night photos are poor as well despite using the low light settings. There is a lot of noise (e. g. big, blurred pixels) in the low light photos and I would say that 1 out of every 3 photos are ruined b/c of either blurriness or low light. Overall, the poor picture quality is real deal killer for me especially since our Canon camera from 5 years ago takes better pictures than this Cybershot. I would not recommend this camera because of the poor image quality. All of the other features are excellent and this camera would be perfect if it was able to combine the high quality images of a Canon camera with the features of the Sony (e. g. 3.0 LCD, 4x optical zoom, etc.) at this price point.
