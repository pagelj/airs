Food tastes better when it has grill lines!
Not sure why... it just does! I was nervous to order the Griddler because some of the less than glowing reviews.  After using it, I love it!  Some of the reviews mentioned the grill plates having plastic clips, not sure if that is the same model or this model has an update but mine came with metal plate clips so no problems there.  I used Trader Joe's non-stick coconut oil spray for my first Griddler meal of chicken and onions and had no problems.  I can see how clean up could be sticky (pun intended) without a non-stick spray.  Next to my Tassimo this is my favorite purchase of the year.  Then again, I am not a kitchen connoisseur and purchased the product for an easier way to cook meats and vegetables since I am trying to cut down on my wheat intake.  The Griddler has met this objective.  Hope you like the Griddler as much as I do!
