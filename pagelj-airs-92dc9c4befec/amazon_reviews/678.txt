My new best friend
The Kindle Fire HD 7" is my second Kindle and a lot of pluses over my first one.  After seeing my granddaughter's with the Standing Leather Case I knew I just had to have one.  The Fuchsia case helps me to find it easily if I misplace it.  I like the way it shuts off just by closing the case.  I miss the green light signal that lets you know it is completely charged.  I can carry it with me all the time and know it is protected.  I love the light and the color, too.
