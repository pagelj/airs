We received this as a wedding gift. The right side of the toaster didnt work so we exchanged it out for a new one. We received the second on and the right side caught on fire! We had flames coming out of our toaster within 10 seconds of turning it on. Disappointed with this product. We are returning it and getting a different brand.
