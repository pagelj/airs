Stage Set For Sequel
Two days later and I'm still mopping my face with a hand towel --- kleenex being absurdly ineffective against the proverbial ocean of tears. My only comfort is the belief that this story will continue -- the stage is set. In the back of my mind I hear old Mrs. Hempstock's bark of laughter as she paraphrases Heraclitus --- " Nothing's ever the same. Be it a second later or a hundred years" --- and while I know this to be true in one sense, in the unchanging landscape of inviolate loves ( of nature, children, and pawed companions ), there is a place for cherished stories such as this.
