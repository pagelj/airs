Highly Functional for the Price
This product is an excellent value.  While I will eventually upgrade in terms of quality and durability, the Gibson Flare 41 piece Cutlery Set has served its purpose very well.  I have more than enough steak knives, measuring cups/spoons, a ladle, slotted spoon, can opener, corkscrew, etc. On the flip side, be aware that you get what you pay for.  The knives are not fully rust-proof, the plastic melts more easily than other products, and the cutting board is tiny.  None of the materials here are top of the line, but they are great as mid- to low-range cooking utensils.  I've never had any complaints with them.
