Good fit and nice product, Poor fabric
I have a German Sheppard puppy and Sam has enjoyed this for our walks.  I used it to have him carry some of his stuff while hiking and even for his regular walks.  The product fits nice and with the different straps can be adjusted to a perfect fit. On the bad side, it does lack space, The saddlebags are not even big enough to fit a regular bottle of water (a standard size of plastic bottle won't allow you to close the zipper. Then after around 10 walks with 4 pounds or less, the fabric on the pokcets tear down. So, bad quality product all in all. I expected more size, more quality and of course, it shouldn't break in less than a month!
