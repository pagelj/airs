Great Camera - But:
I bought this camera after my Japanese brother-in-law bought it in Japan. What I discovered was that it is an exceptional camera with amazing features. However; it was made in China and my Brother-in-law's camera was made in Japan and supported a 20 to 1 zoom (optical & digital) and mine only went to 14 to 1 zoom. So far as I could tell the cameras are the same in all other respects even down to the version number. But it was disappointing to pay so much money for a pocket camera and then find that it is inferior to the Japanese made version. Also, the instruction manual is not very comprehensive - nor does it explain many of the features. I would do a lot more homework the next time I purchase a Sony product.
