Anker Astro 3E review
I purchased the Astro3E approximately one month ago for my iphone5.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  Keep it my day bag and use it frequently for a quick charge when on the go.  Would definitely recommend this and would be buy from this company again.  Anker seems to care that their customers are pleased with their item and purchase.
