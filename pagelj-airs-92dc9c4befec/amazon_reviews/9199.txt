Unreliable GYM BAG
My son has had two of these Adidas bags. BOTH break in precisely the same way: the cords break away from the bagThe one we ordered from Second Sole Total sports arrived broken, and we requested a full refund. The vendor refused, indicating they require "original packaging." What was the "original packaging"?  A brown manila envelope--whereas I returned it in a good padded envelope. I recommend instead the gym bag for the same price by NIKE.
