It doesn't work for me.
The Mountek nGroove Universal CD Slot Mount does not turn far enough towards me so I can see my phone.  It faces too forward for me even though I have it turned as far towards me as it will go.  I have to move my head towards the middle of the car, I can't just glance down to see it. I am not able to reach the buttons on my radio or see what station I'm listening to with out removing the Mountek nGroove Universal CD Slot Mount.  I thought I could just pop the Mountek out. I like to listen to books on CD's on long trips.  I thought the unit would be easy to remove from the CD player and I could just pop it out and change the CD.  I have to turn and turn the know to release the unit to change the CD. It seems like I will have to pull off an exit or go into a rest area to change the CD or else I'm going to be all over the road removing the Mountek nGroove Universal CD Slot Mount, removing the CD and putting in the next CD and reinstalling the Mountek nGroove Universal CD Slot Mount. My phone has a bottom charger so I have to remove the bottom shelf that the phone would normally sit on.  I have my phone in an Otter Box and the phone slips down no matter how tight I try to press the two sides in.
