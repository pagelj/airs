Uh... yeh..... it's not for the spatially challenged.... but it's a VERY GOOD case.
This will be mercifully brief. Unless you're totally incapable of the basest of mental deductions, you should have your Fire in this case in like...... ummm...5 seconds without the benefit of 'directions'. Common logic is a necessity though. The case is gen-you-wine leather and not some plasticine composite (smell it and then go smell your favorite leather accessory)so those complaints can get tossed. The case fits snugly and looks great. Setting the case up to use to view video is also a no-brainer requiring perhaps 7-8 seconds. There is NO danger of cracking the case or any other difficulties so I would  say if a quality accessory case is in you future, this might be a logical (re: logical) choice. I couldn't give it 5 stars as I don't think an item of this nature would probably ever garner 5 stars.
