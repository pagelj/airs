Great cable
I knew as soon as I touched this cable that it is quality. I'm an electrician and have handled a lot of wire. You can  tell by the touch when a cable is superior. Hooked it up and saw the difference immediately! Glad to know Mediabridge is around for when my friends or myself needs cables. Read cnet's reviews. Don't get ripped off by buying an $80. cable.
