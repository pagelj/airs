great memory card
I bought this to see how much faster it is over my numerous Transcend Class 6 16gb sdhc cards and so far it's captured photos from my canon dslr pretty quick.  Transferring the photos from the card to my hard drive was much faster than my Transcend memory cards.  The price is super cheap so I would get on the ball with getting these memory cards!
