Great Idea
I purchased the Mountek specifically because I didn't want anything attached to a ac vent, or stuck to a window. I own a 2008 Wrangler Jeep and locations are limited for any of the other devices. My Ipod fits perfectly into the adjustable cradle, additionally it's now easy to reach and access the screen. Mainly no scratches on vents, or Ipod falling off a window or dash. Great idea, and works better than anticipated
