Phone is OK, T-mobile is not
The good:It does all the things it says it does, provided you have a two year fully loaded plan.  IF you had that plan, you wouldn't be paying 189.00 for a phone. The bad:I have a monthly unlimited plan, and was curious about testing the USB tethering hotspot.  Works great if you only want to go to T-mobile's site with another device.  Yep, can't be used as a hotspot at this price. Turn your wifi off and go to a speed test site.  Best I got with T-mobile's "4G" was 500Kbps - not even 1 Mbps.  Know the difference between 4G and LTE.  T-mobile doesn't have LTE. Visual voice-mail won't work without a 2 year unlimited plan.  T-mobile even blocks 3rd party voice-mail apps. I have no idea when I have a new voice mail.  I have to call it to see. If you really want this phone and use all its features, you have to buy an unlimited plan with a 2 year contract.  T-mobile has done everything to hide that fact when advertising this phone.  Buyer beware. The Ugly:T-mobile, and their deceptive adverting. Who knows what else I will find that won't work. I only had it a week, and it is going back.
