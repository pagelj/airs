Fine product - It will pay for itself the first time that the protector film gets scratched and safes the Kindle screen.
After purchase, I quickly noticed that the screen of my Kindle Paperwhite was fragile.  Rather than wait to see how easily damaged it was I immediately ordered a GreatShield Ultra Screen Protector Film kit.  It came with three precision cut pieces of film (exactly the right size for my Paperwhite) along with a piece of lint-free cloth to clean the Kindle screen.  Application of the GreatShield film was a little nit-picky but following the instructions carefully worked fine.
