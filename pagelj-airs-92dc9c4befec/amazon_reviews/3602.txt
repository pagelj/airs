pretty cool
the phone works fine, although i gave it 4/5 because a few days later a tiiiiiiiiny blue dot appeared in the screen and i don't know if it can be repaired. sometimes it bothers me, sometimes it doesn't. here in venezuela those services tends to be very expensive. but this doesn's affect the functionality in any way. it's a good phone overall.
