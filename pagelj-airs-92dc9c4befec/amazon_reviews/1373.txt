Dont by if you are looking for quality sound!
If you are on a budget for car video, this maybe just for you, if you dont plan to add a sub. this deck due to low volt on the sub out line and cheap audio processor is not recommended. I have try everything to get a good thump from with no success. if the volume is up, it misses the good lows and when its down you get a good thump with no sound from any other freq. oh well thats what i get for not buying the hu i wanted from the beginning.
