Not terribly impressive but works reasonably well
I have tried several IP cameras including the previous, similar model from Foscam.  These work reasonably well with decent image quality given that its only 640x480.  The web interface is pretty typical and resembles that of all other IP cameras I've used.  PTZ controls are ok, but really wish you could adjust the movement speed on the view page itself without having to go into separate configuration pages.  It can be difficult to make fine position adjustments (such as for setting the position memories) except in lower speeds but can be annoying waiting for a lower speed to pan a great distance.  The camera resets itself occasionally but seems to always come back up within a few seconds and has been fairly reliable for 24x7 usage.  This Foscam FI8910W is extremely similar to the Foscam FI8918W.  Other than the slightly nicer external housing with matte finish I don't see any real difference between the two except that this one is quite a bit more expensive.  Wish I had bought two of the others instead.
