Fantastic Optics And Features!
I've been a Nikon users for 40 years (first camera was FTN). While I've enjoyed every one of the lenses I owned, this one is in a class by itself. Being a nature lover (birds, butterflies, critters of all shapes and sizes) I have to constantly shift between telephoto and wide-angle as I encounter new and interesting things. This lens delivers it all. Not only does it feature a HUGE zoom range but I can focus down to 18 inches at every focal length!! Every lens is a compromise because no single lens can deliver every feature at its maximum. The truly great design incorporates the most utility into the most affordable product. This lens DELIVERS!!! Now I'm left with only one decision. Can I put this lens down long enough to use my 200-400 telephoto with doubler for those incredibly long safari shots?
