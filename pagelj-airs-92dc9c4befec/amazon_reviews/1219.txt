I purchased one a couple years ago on Black Friday because I HATE to sweep and HATE to use the dust pan and I loved it so much that I bought another one this last year at Black Friday, just in case the first one breaks and they don't sell them at Black Friday again. I haven't had any problem with them, I only use them for hard floors and small rugs and they work great as long as you empty it out every once in a while. I am vistin my in-laws in Alaska now and cannot seem to find one up here for them, so I am buying another and at full price!
