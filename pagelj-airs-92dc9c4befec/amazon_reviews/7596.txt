just buy it
mounted 5 large flatscreens in my time, by far this one was easiest to mount for 150 dollars less than i paid for other ones, couldnt believe me and a friend had it up in a half hour. im soo happy with this mount i stood in front of it like a dummy jus moving the tv (panny 55st50) side to side(had to loosen the bolts on the arms first though). dont think jus buy!!!! oh bubble levels came broken though, used my trusty 2 foot level anyway
