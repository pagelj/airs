Truly Fanstastic
This is a fantastic read. Not only is the subject matter interesting, intriguing in fact, but the writing is perhaps the best quality writing I've read in a considerable amount of time. I'm not just talking about using proper grammar here. I'm talking about the ART of writing, something too many authors have forgotten, never knew, or have abandoned altogether. Howey has a way of constructing thoughts and painting pictures that is simply enjoyable to read. This is a high quality read for far too low a price in my opinion (not that I'm complaining) and I am very much looking forward to his next offering.
