Sharp Purchase
R. H. Forschner by Victorinox 8-Inch Chef's Knife, Black Fibrox HandleExcellent utensil. Performed better than expected for the price. Blade quality superb. Never had a knife this sharp so you do have to respect that and be careful how you use it. The handle looks a bit cheap, but it's sturdy and comfortable and easy to clean and that's what really matters. Can't beat the value.
