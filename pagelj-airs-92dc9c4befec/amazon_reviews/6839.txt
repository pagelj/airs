Very mediocre, too much noise transferred through headset wire
I know these are relatively inexpensive earbuds and expectations shouldn't be that high. That said, I would not recommend these. Audio sound through the headset is decent, noise cancelling is a bit better than I expected, but the big issue for me is these are only usable when stationary. If I use these while walking or running, as the headset wire rubs against my shirt, a surprising amount of noise is transferred through the headset (not through the audio, just physical noise through the headset). There are other, better headsets for similar price. Or, just go up a bit and buy a better pair.
