A great lens at an amazingly cheap price
The Nikon 18-55 is one of those rare pieces of glass that surprises across the board -- I find that it is far superior to the more expensive Nikon 18-70 kit lens now packaged with most new Nikon dSLR's. The 18-55 is not only a third of the price, but it is crisper and clearer at 18, and super sharp from 35 - 55. There is next to no barrel distortion at 18, certainly far less that the 18-70. And there is nothing better than a 6 ounce lens for carrying to parties, events, and dinners, rather than those pound+ lenses. I highly recommend this lens.
