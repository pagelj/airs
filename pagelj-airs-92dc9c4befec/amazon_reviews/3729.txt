I purchased the CUISINART CPT-120 COOL-TOUCH TOASTER to replace a Proctor Silex model that was driving me insane!  The Proctor Silex toaster was simply S-L-0-W -- sometimes I had to actually toast my bread twice (even at the highest setting) just to get it slightly brown. So, a friend recommended this one, and it's wonderful!  Its compact design makes it easy to fit on a crowded counter top, and the nine temperature settings allow you to choose between a very light toasting and full dark.  I tried the 6th setting first, and it was a shade too dark for my taste -- 5 was perfect.  And it's toasts in about a quarter of the time of my Proctor Silex. There is one negative (thus the four instead of five stars):  The temperature dial is illuminated (the numbers glow orange), which means the toaster is using electricity constantly, even when not being used to toast anything.  The instruction book that came with the toaster recommends unplugging it when not in use, but that's really annoying (and not practical).  There's no reason for the illuminated dial -- the toaster would be perfect without it. But overall, I'm very pleased.  It does what a toaster is supposed to do, and it does it very well.
