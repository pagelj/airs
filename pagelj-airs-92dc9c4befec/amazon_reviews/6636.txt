fantastic alternative?
Can't stand sat/cable pricing. This is my second roku. Rroku works well providing you have decent internet speed. approx 3gb or higher. does have a wide selection of channels. I have netflix and hulu plus.. netflix runs smooth but hulu locks up every once in awhile. Overall I'm very happy. I pay under $20 a month compared to $100 and get alot but not all programming I want. Sports is the biggest drawback as I have not found a reliable place for free football,baseball,nascar.. etc
