Works perfectly once you get it on the dash securely
We've been looking for something like this for a while.  Our primary concern is the type of car we have, where the windshield sits too far away from the seats to be feasible, and the dash isn't very smooth.  We ordered this one based on reviews, and love it.  It did take a while to find the exact right spot between comfortable reach and a flat enough area on the dash.  It also took a few tries to get it to stick properly.  Now that its on, though, its a great stick and doesn't move. Pros:Stays well, even on slightly rounded dash area. Fits both HTC OneX and iPhone 3Gs. Perfect to use for both GPS features on the phone as well as safety when driving. Works exactly as descibed. Cons:It does fit the HTC as noted above, but with the protective case on it *barely* fits.  That being said, it does work and holds the unit in place - it just doesn't snap down.
