I am telling anyone who will listen that this whole series is a must read. Generally, I arrive late to the party, but this time I don't feel like the last person on the planet to discover the work of such a talented author. I give the series my highest praise, and recommend it to anyone (even non- SciFi readers, like I USED to be;o) What a fantastic read! Kudos, Mr. Howey
