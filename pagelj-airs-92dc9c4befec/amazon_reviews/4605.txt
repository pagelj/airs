Sandisk never lets me down
I got a few of these for my sister for her new camera.  I've used sandisk flash drives, and memory cards for the past 7-ish years and (except for the ones I lost) they are all still working.  I've never had any glitches or memory loss problems with sandisk like I have with some other brands
