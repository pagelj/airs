cool but not that great
i tried these in a store the other day. they are cool, but not worth the money. the image stabilization wile it does make a shakey image stable, its no where near as stable as the people in the above comments claim. there is a noticeable improvement, but not $600 worth of improvement. id wait awhile and see what the next generation of this technology has to offer before comminting to purchase.
