Love Love Love this camera
So I've been a loyal Canon user for ages, till my canon elphs when floating down the rivers..  I then found my first stylus that was water resistant, that worked great for snowboarding.. then along came the ssw 770 and loved it, then something else as 10meg, and now this 8010 and it's a dream. I like the 720vid, also you can ZOOM in while you shoot video.. now granted the stills aren't as great colorwise as other cameras, but the others can't take the beating and elements like this camera can !!!  Here are a few vids shot with this camera [...] the last video I just mounted the camer on the boards with a gorrila mini pod and some duct tape ;0)
