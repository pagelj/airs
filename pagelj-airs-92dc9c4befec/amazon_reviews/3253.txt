Considering the price, I am very happy with this toaster. We have only toasted and baked breads and ready to eat items. So far have been very satisfied. Need to be careful about setting the timer otherwise it can burn the toasts. If you put the shelf on the lowest rung you need to set the heat time lower and so on.
