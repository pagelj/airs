The Hoover Platinum Lightweight Upright is a light and handy vacuum that works just fine.  Unlike many other reviewers, I find the included canister vacuum to be quite useful.  Hose attachments to upright vacs have never worked all that well for me.  I can use this one to vacuum the car and get into tight spaces and inaccessible areas to do things like clean out the groves that sliding doors and windows sit in. I have only been using this for a few weeks so I cannot remark on long-term reliability.  I bought a big box of replacement bags when I bought the vac but a single bag holds a lot of dirt -- still on the one that came inside the vacuum.
