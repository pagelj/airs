Good quality backpack
My daughter uses this backpack for school and really likes it. It sits nicely on her back and looks very secure, It has several pockets, including one at the tip-top for an mp3 player with the necessary holes for your headphones to reach your ears, and it also has straps at the bottom for a blanket, flute case, etc... she doesn't use the straps and it's not obvious that they are there.  Her only issue was that her large 2" binders along with books are sometimes a bit snug... but I really can't see her using anything larger.
