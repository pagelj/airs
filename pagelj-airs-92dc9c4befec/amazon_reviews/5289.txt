Great Product for Price
Bought it for HP dv7 notebook 17.3" and it's great!  Just be sure to select the right size.  My only complaint is that the padding was surprisingly thin.  I have a high-end laptop and would rather it be safe.  The padding is about a few millimeters thick, but it's of light-weight, foamy material.  I was thinking it had a hard-plastic exterior with foamy interior.  Oh well, good buy none-the-less and keeps dirt out!
