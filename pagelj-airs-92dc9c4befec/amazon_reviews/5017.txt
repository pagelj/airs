AirPlay works great, but content unimpressive for me
I really just bought this to link my iPad and our iPhones to my old Bose system to play music.  AirPlay function works excellent for that purpose.  For $100 I think this is worth it for that purpose alone.  Can link to computer to play music from iTunes, and also can upload purchased music into Apple TV to play directly.  You can mirror iPad or iPhone 4S+ to view on TV, decent feature except that iPad doesn't have 16:9 aspect ratio so part of your tv screen doesn't get utilized. Content of Apple TV was unimpressive for me, but I already had most of those features on my Bluray player anyway.
