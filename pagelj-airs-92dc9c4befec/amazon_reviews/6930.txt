If you want to do the solar charging go somewhere else
This Opteka Solar Power Bank can only provide you with about a half + of the capacity as claimed. After fully charged it would only charge up 20% of a Samsung galaxy tab 10.1 which is rated at 8000mAh. Pro:The included various USB adapters are very handy. Con:The solar panel is so small (or inefficient) that it can barely charge the battery (may be up to 25% for a day).  AC charging is OK.
