Danger Days - Worth Every Shiny Penny
Finally, a band has breathed life into a genre that, in recent years, has begun to lull itself to sleep.  Remember when rock was fantastical, larger-than-life, and challenged the very ground it stood on?  Yeah, neither do I.  The last time it did that, I wasn't even born yet. This band must have noticed the same thing since they took the ideals of pop, punk, dance, and rock, and brewed them together in the mind of a comic book genius.  The concoction is bold, jolting, and downright fun.  Totally worth the $10-$15 to buy.  Would make a great Christmas/Hanukkah gift.
