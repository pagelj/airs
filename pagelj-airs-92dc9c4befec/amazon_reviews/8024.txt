Broken after only a year
This DVD player is literally so broken I can't even get my DVD out of it.  And of course it broke like 3 days after the warranty is up.  Not worth it, there are so many DVD players out there that are inexpensive and will last 5 years like my last DVD player.  Don't bother with this one.
