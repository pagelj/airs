HEADS UP FOR BLACK FRIDAY BUYERS: this was originally nineteen bucks, not thirty six--don't think you're getting a to-die for deal. Chances are, the price will drop in a week or two. Last year, I lived in a decrepit hole-in-the-wall known as "student housing". The oven (older than my parents) was coated in an inch of black tar--completely unusable. Being on a tight budget, I opted for this toaster oven. I wouldn't say it's the best, but it served its purpose well. I cooked: toaster strudels, home-made pizzas, chicken, beef, home-made fries, home-made chicken pot pies, etc. Very versatile, good for anything you can't just heat up in a microwave. It does take time and patience, though. Seeing as I cook more to eat food rather than enjoy it (I'm no chef) I don't really notice a difference in quality. Those of you who actually know what you're doing when you cook, or are not used to sub-par living conditions, might not enjoy this product as much as I did. Also, I never used it to toast toast--I have a TOASTER for that. Most of the 1/5 reviews come from people frustrated with literal toast. NOTE: I would recommend lining the bottom with foil--makes it much easier to clean/remove crumbs. NOTE: Want to enjoy ghetto pizza like me? Toast pita bread, take it out and cover it in sauce, add cheese, add whatever toppings you want, and stick it back in until the cheese melts to perfection.
