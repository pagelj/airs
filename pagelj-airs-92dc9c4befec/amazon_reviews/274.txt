The best custermer service！
I bought this screen protector for my black iphone5, when I saw the screen protector ,when I finish I just curious"Why is this hole is to the left of the screen protector's middle,is there so hard to make it in the middle?"Then I sent a e-mail to Tech Armor customer service,told them the hole is not in the middle and also told them I feel the glare problem is too obvious. Hours later,I got a reply,the Customer support team explain very carefully to let me know the reason why the hole to the left is to leave spaces for two sensors so the two sensors can perform normally. And they want me 100% satisfy that they were very glad to sent me a replacement pack of 3 Anti-Fingerprint/Anti-Glare screen protectors at no cost to me. And I received the replacement pack promptly. I was so exciting about the amazing warranty, sadly there is another pack of 3 HD Screen Protectors but not  a replacement pack of Anti-Fingerprint/Anti-Glare screen protectors. Then I mail them again and told them this situation，you can't believe what had happened，they would like give me  another replacement pack of 3 Anti-Fingerprint/Anti-Glare screen protectors at no cost to me，This is crazy , although I feel upset with the wrong sending mistake，but their positive action just cheer me up . I love Tech Armor! It should be your first choice. If you choose Tech Armor! You'd got better manufacture and the best customer service!
