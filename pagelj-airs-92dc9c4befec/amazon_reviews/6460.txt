I phone 4 screen replacement
The screen works great, my only complaint is that the screen is not as bright and colorful as the original, but unless you have done your research and have compared side by side its just as good as the original. Its turned my ipaperweight back into a iPhone for 1/4 the cost of other places I found the screen. Good luck with installation!!!  You will need it!
