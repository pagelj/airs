my first blu ray
Ive been looking to buy a blu ray player for a while just never got around to it. I finally picked one up at a discount. For a first ime blu ray, its awsome. Put together with my big flat screen and suround sound in my living room, its the complete home theater experince. Linking your netflix, crackle or hulu plus accounts to your blu ray will open up your library, you can also acess and videos, music, or videos in the proper folders on your home computer. You can also copy media on to a usb drive that can be connected to the front of your blu ray. Along with this puchase i also bought the tarantino xx collectors pack and spent my week watching all his movies and the 15 hrs of bonus interviews.
