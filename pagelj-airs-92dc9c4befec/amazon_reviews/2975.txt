Amazing camera
So far this camera has went above and beyond my expectations. It takes amazing pictures in and out of the water. I have used this camera mainly for floating trips on the river and it's great not having to worry about it getting wet. It's very east to use and I couldn't be happier with the camera, especially for the price.
