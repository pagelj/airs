Very Happy
I had never bought a case from this company before. What made me go through with it was reading some of the many posotive reviews of this product  as well as seeing that they had a very good raiting. When i had recieved my phone case i was extremely happy, there was no damage done to neither the package or product itself and my case is holding up very well and i have had it for over a month now (no tears, marks, or anything really noticable). It is a great phone case and I recommend getting it if your looking for a good stylish phone case:)
