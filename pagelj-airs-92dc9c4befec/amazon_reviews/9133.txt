I love it
I got it last night and it was in the drawer within an hour after I got home.  It was the right size and everything fit and it is really nice looking.  The fact that it slides open (and shut) was not an issue for me, because it does not slide shut when you put serving pieces in the large compartment - they fill it up enough so it stays put. It is really roomy and such an improvement over the previous divider I had. It is sturdy and really well made and nicely finished.  And it is "green"!  I am really pleased that I bought it.
