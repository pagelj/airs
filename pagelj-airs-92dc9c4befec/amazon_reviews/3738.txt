Couldn't Put It Down...
I'm not a big reader but I couldn't put this book down. I am a major gamer though and where games are concerned this book hits on all points. Fans of classic video games, table-top RPG'S, and 80's nostalgia take notice because this book is an epic adventure written by and for the proudly nerdy among us.
