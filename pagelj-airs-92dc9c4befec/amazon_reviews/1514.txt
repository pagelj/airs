Adorable!
This backpack is a little big large for my 24 month old but the straps are adjustable and I can make it pretty snug for him. It's so cute and I know he will grow into rather quickly. The fabric is nice and durable and the zippers are sturdy yet easy for my toddler to use. We will be using it as a travel pack for him and he loves "packing" his own fun things in it already. The pocket on the side is big enough for just about and standard bottle or sippy cup. I actually love it so much I'm considering buying another one so we can switch them out if he wants to. They are a good price and I think worth every penny.
