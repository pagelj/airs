Extreme value
If you are looking for a compact super-zoom camera look no further. Everything is above expectations, speed, friendlyness, focusing speed, etc. With all the features included (I will not re-list them here) it's a no-brainer, however what strikes me most is the quality pictures you can take on dimm light and no flash. That's a cool feature specially when the subjects are beyond the builtin flash's range. I was evaluating the new Nikon 1 but, after careful thought, I decided against it in favor of the P510 due to more versatility, zoom, features, gps and less price. It's a safe buy for anyone looking for a feature packed camera and not willing to spend/carry a pro SLR
