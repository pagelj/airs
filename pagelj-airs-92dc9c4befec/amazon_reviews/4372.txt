Amazingly Satisfied
I decided to buy this cable when I bought Planet Earth on Blueray for use on a PS3.  I had read through a lot of the reviews, most are very good, but I was still thinking that there would not be too big of a difference between this cable and the $60 Monster component cable that I bought a few years ago and had been using.  But, for under $10 with shipping I figured what the heck, why not.  I had always noticed that the PS3, with component connection, looked a little "washed out", which I believe is a known issue with it.  After connecting the HDMI cable, the difference was immediatly apparent.  Colors were a lot more vibrant, text was so much sharper, contrast was better, etc.  Agreeing with other reviews, the cable is actually very solidly built, does not feel or look cheap at all.  You definatly would not think it was a $3 cable.  I can't comment on the sound issue some people were reporting, as I am using an optical cable to the receiver.  Oh and by the way, Planet Earth looks simply amazing on my Samsung 56in DLP in 1080i.
