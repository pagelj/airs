Love It
First let me say I got this item for $.01 cent. That in itself is awesome.  My original Kindle Fire charger came up missing. I searched everywhere and was so upset because we have several chargers that fit the Kindle and our phones around the house, I just happen to like [having] my own stuff.  After about a week of endless searching I decided to order another one.  Low and behold my original charger re-appears. But that's fine because now I have one I can carry in my purse and for $.01 cent I can't complain.
