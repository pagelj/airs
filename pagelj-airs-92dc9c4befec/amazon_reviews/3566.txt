The absolute best knife set you will every buy!! Hands down!!
I received this set as a wedding gift over 6 years ago and have purchased almost all of the products that Rada offers! I just purchased another set for my sister in law for Christmas this year. They are simply amazing. Be sure to also buy the knife sharpener to keep your knives freshly sharpened. I had a Cutco rep come to my house and do a presentation about a year ago and my Rada knives out performed his Cutco ones during his presentation!!! Embarrassing for him. :)  AND they are a fraction of the price! Everyone ended up going home and buying Rada instead of Cutco! Hilarious!! I also love the ice cream scoop that Rada makes! It cuts through the hardest ice cream with ease. Overall, Rada is a great product for a great price. Perfect for any gift or just for yourself!
