Excellent Camera
I bought this camera for my Wife because she told me she wanted a Camera that was easy to use and that takes good pictures, I read all of the reviews I could find about the Cannon T3 and the T3i and I felt that the value was there so I bought the T3i. I feel I got a great Camera for a fair price and so far my Wife is still Smiling so I guess I did the right thing. We have taken a few pictures of our 2 German Shepherds and of all of our Grand Children and we plan on taking quite a lot more. I am well pleased with the Quality of the Camera and of the Pictures we have taken.
