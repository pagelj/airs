Well done
I enjoyed this book more than I expected. It is worth more than the 99 cents. It's a good read and fast-paced. The only problem I had with it were the exclamation marks. There were just far too manyh of them, and I have never been terribly fond of them and they just seemed to pop out at the most inconvenient moments. I definitely recommend this one.
