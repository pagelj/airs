Three Cheers For My Chemical Romance
My Chemical Romance debuts from New Jersey. Their first album I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love was an excellent album, and thier followup from a much bigger record company falls short to the first album. Don't get me wrong, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is a great album. It consists of 13 tracks. They are:1. Helena-5/5. This track is one of the best lyrically and instrumentally on the entire album.2. Give 'Em Hell, Kid-5/5. This is a great song.3. To The End-5/5. This is one of the best five on the entire album. It probably is the best song on the entire album.4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison-3/5. This track falls short from any track on their debut album.5. I'm Not Okay (I Promise)-4/5. Great song, but it also falls short from the original.6. The Ghost of You-4/5. This a haunting song that's great, but it is far from being the best song on the album.7. The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You-4/5. Great song.8. Interlude-5/5. Haunting and incredible.9. Thank You For The Venom-5/5. One of the best on the album.10. Hang 'Em High-3/5. Just okay.11. It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A F***ing Deathwish-4/5. One of the best on the album.12. Cemetary Drive-5/5. One of the best on the album.13. I Never Told You What I Did For A Living-5/5. One of the best on the album. The only thing this album does is leave you begging for more.
