My FloorMate worked great the first time I used it, but the second time I went to use it, it wouldn't turn on. One day my kids were playing with it, folding and unfolding the handle, and somehow that fixed the problem and I was able to get it to turn back on. But now the water won't spray. I made sure the tanks were securely in place, but it still won't spray. I tried turning the cleaning mode dial very slowly to make sure I didn't have it in between one of the settings, but it's definitely on the "clean" setting. And as soon as I messed with the handle to see if maybe it wasn't clicked in place which might be causing the problem, the unit shut off and won't turn back on. Arrrrrggggh!!!! I called Hoover and they said I'd need to bring it to a certified repair store. Ugh. Well, the ONE time that it worked for me it did do a great job. UPDATE: So I decided to try something before I took my FloorMate to a service center to get it fixed under warranty. When you get the FloorMate, you have to insert the handle into the machine and push until it clicks. I did that, but the problems that I was having with it seemed like there was a short in the handle somewhere. So I pushed down on the handle as hard as I could, and that did the trick! The sprayer now works and yesterday I was able to clean my kitchen floor without the FloorMate shutting off by itself. Hoover should put this step in the "troubleshooting" section of the user's guide.....
