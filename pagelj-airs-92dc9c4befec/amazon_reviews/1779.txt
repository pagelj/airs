This product does a generally very good job, although I agree with some comments that it doesn't scrub as well as it could - different scrubbing powers would be a good feature. However I had it just over a year and used it twice a week, then the motor burnt out and I was quoted more to repair it than it cost!! The machine is not up to what I consider to be normal wear and tear. I would not have expected an ordinary vacuum cleaner to have a burnt out motor after a year and this product should be of the same standard. I remain firmly convinced of the value of such a product, however there is no real immediate competitor on the market, most other wet/dry vacs only suck up spills and don't actually deliver detergent and scrub. After considerable searching of the net I have forked out nearly 8x the price for a Lindhaus machine that seems much more heavy duty (they were originally for commercial use) - at the price it had better deliver the goods!
