I wasn't expecting much but was pleasently surprised
I rented this because the trailer looked good.  Of course we've all done that before and have found that everything good is in the trailer.  So I was surprised that there was more substance in this movie then you would expect.  Just enough action, sci-fi, story and done well.  This ones a keeper.
