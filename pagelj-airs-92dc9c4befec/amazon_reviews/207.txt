Video stopped working 1 month in...
We bought this video monitor, set it up in our infant's room before she was born.  It worked great initially.  After our daughter was born, we turned it on and the video display was grey- only a shadow of an image day and night.  Because it worked initially, we got rid of the packaging, so can't return.  Thank goodness the sound is good- we will use for that- a very expensive audio monitor...
