Short but Sweet
Your typical waking up in Vegas story with a slight twist.  The characters' motives for getting married are unique but thats about it.  Characters aren't as developed as I would have liked and the plot line is a bit jumpy but it was a decent read.  Would recommend if you are looking for a good read that won't take long and doesn't beat around the bush.
