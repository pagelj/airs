Skip Hop Zoo Pack Review
I purchased the Frog Zoo Pack for my son to take to Pre-K.  We went online to Amazon and he was able to look at all the options and pick the animal that he liked the best. We are thrilled with the backpack.  It is very well made. It is the perfect size for him and completely adorable.  He loves taking it in each day. Amazon made getting is very easy.  Most of the stores in our area were out of the frop and with Amazon I was able to get it in time for the first day of school.
