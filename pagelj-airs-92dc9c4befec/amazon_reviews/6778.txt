This New Roku HD is Awesome
I have a house full with Roku XDS we cut the cord last year. We need an other one and at $99.00 for XDS we wanted to save a couple of buck so we tried this New HD model. I tried the old Roku Hd and the Wifi was awful but we thought what the heck. I am happy at we did :) The wifi adapter in this new Roku is great. It is way better than the one on my XDS's. I tired one of the XDS upstairs in our son's room and the wifi signal was weak. With the New HD the signal is on Excellent. Also we Discovered a Media Server called Plex! I am so happy we Did now I stream all my Media to all my Roku's and no longer in need for USB port. One thing I wish it had was an Ethernet port but for $59.00 it a good deal.
