I was quite happy with this vacuum.  For a while, I had been considering the other brand that didn't lose suction, but I just couldn't justify the price.  Once the Hoover came into my life, I have to say that I'm quite happy I waited!  The power behind the suction is awesome, it's lightweight, and awesome to use! I loved how easy it was to put together.  Other vacuums I've had seemed extensive, but this one was good to go in minutes!  I also appreciate how the filter is reusable, because who wants to spend extra money and add to the landfills?! My only complaint would be about the additional hose add-on.  Mine always wants to flop off the side of vacuum when it sits in its storage.  It aggravated me to no end, so now the hose just sits in the closet until I use it. I received a sample of this product to facilitate my review, but my opinions are entirely my own.
