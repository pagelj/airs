Before purchasing this Presto percolator nearly everything in my 1954 kitchen was period appropriate with one glaring exception, my drip coffee maker. After doing quite a bit of research I quickly settled on the Presto as it has not only the most authentic looking classic coffee pot design, but also the best ratings. It may take you a pot or two to get the hang of using a percolator but once you have it I think you'll be impressed. You don't have to use filters with this but I recommend them as it gives you the best of both worlds, a nice bold cup of coffee but without the oils and sediment and no need to invest in a pricey grinder right away that has a percolator grind setting. No grinds to track down also makes cleanup a snap with no worry of grinds getting into your disposal. The filters that came with this weren't too impressive but I was able to find pre-punched wrap style filters both locally and online. The trick to having zero grinds get out of the basket and into the pot is to gently work the pre-punched opening of the filter over the stem without tearing the opening any wider... I sort of push gently while twisting back and forth side to side a little and it will slip right on. The directions that come with the pot may give you coffee a bit stronger than you want. For 4 cups I use 2 and a half just slightly rounded tablespoons of coffee which still provides a very robust flavor. Perhaps one of your biggest surprises when you set this up will be what a compact footprint it will have on your counter top and how much less cluttered things look. Highly recommended.
