Science twisted by fates
Because I'm a retired scientist, I enjoyed all the ins and outs of the decisions of the career path of Anne.  The fact that we are told somewhere early on that Stanford owns the company only made me want to see the end.  Early life family connections, in spite of unknown last names made the story real in this day and age where so many young folks are parts of blended families.  Many of the reviews obviously were written by ones who couldn't get beyond the science and "green" company.  More like this one would be fine for summer reading.
