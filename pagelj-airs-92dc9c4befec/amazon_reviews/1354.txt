We've owned many different vacuums over the years, and this vacuum out-performs them all!  It replaced our Oreck AND our Dyson, after we received it and saw what it picked up ... that the Oreck and Dyson had BOTH left behind!  This vacuum sucks!  In a GOOD way!  :)  The price is awesome, it's light-weight, the hose is just the right length, and it comes with a LONG power cord (which we love).  Quite possibly, the world's best vacuum!  DON'T buy an Oreck or a Dyson!  This vacuum is MUCH better!
