Works excellently, just requires a bit of effort
I highly recommend this product. Pros:- Works excellently. The touch sensitivity doesn't seem to have diminished, and the glare doesn't seem to have increased, even in bright sunlight. Cons:- The protector's slightly smaller than the screen (for a Kindle Touch as on Jun 20, 2012). Maybe it's to make applying it easier, but I wish it could be the same size.- The tab they provide isn't very useful by itself. I used a credit card to smooth out air bubbles while I held the protector up from one end using the tab.- It takes a little time to apply it (this really can't be helped though, it's the nature of screen protectors). Tips:- Dust particles on the screen will lead to air bubbles when you apply the protector. Before applying it, sit away from air conditioners, fans, and windows.- Make sure you have a decent source of light in the room when you're applying the protector.- When you apply the screen protector, apply it widthwise instead of lengthwise. That makes it much easier.- Smooth out air bubbles as you apply it. Be patient.- Try smoothing it out in a way that in the end, you have just one corner left to smooth out instead of one side.- If you can't do it perfectly, you can always use another one of the protectors; you have 3. When you remove one from the screen, you also remove any dust particles that were on there. Makes it much easier to apply the next protector.
