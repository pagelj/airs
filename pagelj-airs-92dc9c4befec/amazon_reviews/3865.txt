Very disappointed.
I just wanted a simple phone. I thought this was perfect, and it was for the first month. Then after that I can't use it at all. It has a mind of it's own and will not let me use the flip open option at all. Any button I press makes it go haywire and bring up every option besides the one I am requesting. It will not open any text messages, including media ones. I think I got a lemon, because a phone should definitely last more than a month!!! Very disappointed with this purchase.
