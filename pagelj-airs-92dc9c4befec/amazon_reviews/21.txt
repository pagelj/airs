Forged Henckel knives, using the German steel formula, at less than half the cost of the professional series.  Full tang blades, solid handles, great steel, same blade shapes as the 4-star series.  These are a great buy and I have not noticed a bit of difference between these knives and the Henckel 4-star knives I grew up with.
