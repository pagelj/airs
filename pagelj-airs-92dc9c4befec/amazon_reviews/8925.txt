Thank goodness
Thank goodness I had this on my lens! My camera was in its bag, this filter and a lens cap were on my lens, my camera bag fell from the height of a regular Dining room chair onto a hardwood floor and my $1000+ lens was protected because I had this filter on it; the filter itself completely shattered (of course a filter is a pretty thin piece if glass) but I believe it protected my lens from breaking.
