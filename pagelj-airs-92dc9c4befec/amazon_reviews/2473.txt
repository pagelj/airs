A Beautiful Slim Cover for My Kindle Fire HD 7"
After buying the Kindle Fire HD 7" here on Amazon, I knew I needed a protective case.  I went to my local Staple's store and saw the Amazon's Kindle Fire HD 7" Standing Leather Case in Onyx Black.  I'm the type of person who has to see the product in my hands before buying. Much to my surprise, this case is well worth the price.  It's an all in one case (form-fitting):  back cover that molds around the back and sides of my Kindle device and the attached front cover that covers and protects the glass display.  The Kindle Fire HD slips and kind of snaps into place.  The sides of this case protects the edges of my new Kindle device. The case is light and slim a huge plus when you are carrying this device/case in your bag.  There are cutouts for the audio jack on one side and for the HDMI and micro-USB connectors.  There are two grills that cover the dual speakers on the back. The inside front cover has a nice soft fabric that won't scratch the Kindle device.  The front cover is magnetic and can "put the device to sleep" when closed.  The cover can be used to prop up the device in the horizontal position.  The cover can also be swung to the back and folds flat behind the Kindle device.  Nice! The Kindle device and case combo has a nice feeling in my handles.  The case has a nice textured leather pattern and very sturdy.  It doesn't feel like it will slip out of my hands. I also own a second general iPad and Apple cover.  Considering what I paid for just the Apple cover (non-leather, this Kindle leather cover is a bargain. I believe the only issue with the case is figuring out which color to get.  The colors are beautiful. Amazon did a nice job with the quality and functionality of this case.  I really like having this all-in-one type of case.
