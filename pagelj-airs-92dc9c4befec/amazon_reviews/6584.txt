Great Item
I originally had a hdtv with a built in dvd player... the dvd portion of it stopped working and I had to get a new one. For the money and short time it took to get this product I was anxious, two kids in the house they miss their Land Before Time collection and other movies. Set up is 1,2 and you're good to go. I love it so far.
