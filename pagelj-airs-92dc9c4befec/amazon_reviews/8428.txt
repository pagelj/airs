Great lens - easy to use
Love this lens.  I am not a professional photographer so I can't rate it based upon that.  But for my use it is just wonderful.  I have very shaky hands but the pictures still come out crisp.  I have used the telephoto and it works well.  I still have yet to use it on a tripod, but even fully zoomed out (and my shaky hands), the pictures are great!
