Disappointing moralizing
Abaddon's Gate begins innocently enough, we are introduced to new characters and the overarching story takes a reasonable turn, the goal of the protomolecule is revealed. The novel moves at a much slower pace, but, slowly the authors' purpose for the entire series is revealed. We aren't being lead on a scifi/horror adventure for entertainment, or even to explore the complexities of human thought - but to be preached at. If you agree with the premise of the lecture, you'll probably find the journey plodding but tolerable. Myself, I could barely finish the last 200 pages, when the mask slips and intent of the series is revealed. I fluxed between bored disinterest and moments of anger at the characters I've grow to care about being betrayed by their creators for some ideological end. The entire narrative revolves around a number of new characters that are merely ideological tools. One in particular, Anna, serves as the mouthpiece of the authors' ideology and is an archetypal Mary Sue. She has no faults, and her only struggles involve finding the best way to manipulate others into accepting her worldview as correct. Our old favorite characters, and particularly Naomi, are used as props to justify and enable Anna. Other characters are introduced to serve as counterpoints to anyone who would disagree with Anna. These other characters are all broken, with clear, obnoxiously referenced, character flaws. Anna is perfect in every way and never exhibits so much as a moment of doubt or a single human flaw. Anna is not a person, she is a bald-faced worldview awkwardly wearing a human's backstory. I've not encountered such a one-dimensional, arrogant, and unrealistic character since reading the unbearable works of Ayn Rand. I almost can't believe this was written by the same authors as the first two books. In fact I hope one of them didn't participate, so I can still respect the other.
