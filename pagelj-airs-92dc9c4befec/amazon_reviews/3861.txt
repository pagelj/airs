ASUS Ultrabook
The notebook came in good time and was packed well. I will use it as my work computor and carry it around alot so wanted somthing light and easy to transport. The touch screen is nice to use and have had no issues with it yet. Did load up windows business and it was preloaded so only took like 5 min. to have it installed. Just put in key that i purchased on line from Amozon. Was cheaper that what was on the notebook stated for the package price.
