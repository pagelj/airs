I like to vacuum now... CRAZY!
I got this vacuum for Christmas (yes, I know.  But in hubby's defense I actually asked for a new vacuum for Christmas).  He did TONS of research to identify a canister vac that met my needs: had to use bags, had to be light and good with pet hair.  By getting this as a gift cost wasn't as much of a concern as it was kind of a treat, and let me tell you--this is totally worth the cost.  It's super light, super quiet, and super effective.  I can vacuum while having a conversation, that's how quiet it is.  And you can easily take it up and down the stairs.  It has a handy little hook that allows you to connect the hose and bar to the canister so that you can carry it all with one hand. It is so easy to take this vacuum out that I find myself cleaning more frequently than I did before.  And its multi-level suction capability makes it perfect for everything from light cleaning of curtains to heavy-duty cleaning of high-traffic carpets.  And the unexpected benefit that I love the most: you don't change the attachment when you switch from hard floors to carpet; the same head unit is used for both.  I never thought about it, but just pushing a button when I switch rooms rather than having to disconnect and reconnect attachments is a HUGE timesaver.  I love this vacuum!
