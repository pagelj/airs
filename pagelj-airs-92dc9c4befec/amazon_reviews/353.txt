Like so many others, I spent weeks researching coffee makers and feedback before finally deciding on this product and I couldn't be happier with my decision; it's everything I hoped for, and more.  My primary goal was the ability to program cutoff WHEN I WANTED IT TO, rather than the usual 2-hour cutoff (some days I get up at 5:00 a. m.; some days at 7:00 a. m....)  This product (in black) is extremely attractive and easy to clean.  Program/set-up was a breeze. The carafe lid snaps on & off and has a small spout so the coffee stays HOT but not too hot, and it does not leak.  Altho the water filter is nice, I always use bottled water in my coffee makers anyway.  I really like the 4-5 beeps to let you know the brewing cycle is finished and the two beeps to announce the auto cutoff.  Can't say much for the clock since it's so small and not illuminated, but that's insignificant, considering all the other outstanding qualities.  Even better: this Amazon order qualified for free shipping!
