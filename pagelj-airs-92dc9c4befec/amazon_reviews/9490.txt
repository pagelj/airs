Oustanding! I love it!
I bought The Atopia Chronicles on Hugh Howey's recommendation and I'm glad I did. It is an expertly written vision of the future where reality and virtuality become blurred and there's no coming back. At once chilling and exciting, Mathers' ability to weave a human voice into a world of cold tech is disarming and addictive. Now I'm just waiting for his next books! In the meantime though, the author has a site phuturenews that is regularly updated with imaginative glimpses of what the future holds in the form of fake news stories. thank you!
