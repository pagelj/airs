Great Classic Movie At A Fantastic Price!
"When Worlds Collide" is one of my very favorite Sci-Fi movies. It is based on a book by the same name, co-written by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer (which is a great book with and enjoyable sequel, "After Worlds Collide"). The movie is appropriate for all but the youngest viewers and rates highly on my family's "Lazy Saturday" movie list. The plot is fast moving, the acting is good, and the "classic" special effects are enjoyable (matte-paintings :-)This is a bargain priced DVD for a fantastic movie! Highly recommended! CFH
