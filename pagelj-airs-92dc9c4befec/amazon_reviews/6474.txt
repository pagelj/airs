everything promised and more
I've been buying square trade warranties for years and only had to place a claim recently. My laptop hard drive crashed and they paid for overnight shipping both ways and even put in a bigger (double the gigs) hard drive than had been there. Square Trade is awesome! I will certainly go to them for all my warranty needs!
