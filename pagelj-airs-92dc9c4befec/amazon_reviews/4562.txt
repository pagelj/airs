Get over it!!!
For those expecting "Enders Game", or any one of the wonderful pure science fiction books out there, just stop. All the people complaining about the "Rampant sex", orgies and drug use, fail to mention how minor a place these actually fill in the book. Even if this offends your puritanical sensibilities, note that of the 300 or so pages of the book, you could take all the references to sex and drugs and fill 3 to 4 pages. Look beyond your own hang ups, and see the deeper messages that this book tries to convey. Yeah, you can write a scathing review and feel better about yourself in a "See how smart I am" kind of way, but you missed the true points entirely; War makes no sense, it's usually waged for the stupidest of reasons, and true love will stand the test of time........ and what a long time indeed. Do yourself a favor and just read the book. After having served in the military for 22 years and retiring in 1999, I truly enjoyed the book as a reminder of how silly things can be when taken too seriously...............
