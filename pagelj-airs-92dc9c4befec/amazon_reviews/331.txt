Awful product
I read a zillion reviews of moderately priced Blue-ray players and this one consistently came out at or near the top of the class.  Well, it appears as though I received a lemon.  This BR player stops playing after 55 minutes of play on hearly every Blu-Ray movie. Panasonic's response:  buy a thumb drive, b/c this player may not have enough storage for newer Blu-Ray movies.  I said, REALLY?  Thats a sufficient response.  I did that, and the player STILL diddnt work, so Panasonic required my to return the player to Texas AT MY COST.  I will never buy another Panasonic product.  They sold me a lemon and then I had to incur the cost of postage.  RIDICULOUS.
