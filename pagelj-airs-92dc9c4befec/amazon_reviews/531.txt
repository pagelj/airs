Redeeming Love
This is the best book that I have ever read.  I couldn't put it down, and I would find myself constantly thinking about it.  It was such an awsome way to see how much God loves us like Micheal loved Angel.  It was a great  way to see how a love relationship should be.  It was a God-sent thing for  me. I love it!
