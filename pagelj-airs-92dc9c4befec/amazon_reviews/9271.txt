Does not seem like a mini phone
I am using the phone for a few days now. I bought it from another site though I belive the seller also sells the phone in amazon. The unlocked phone I received had default settings in french (had language set as french and temp as celcius). The box also had the samsung website address for french (/fr). It was easy to go to settings and change these. Phone has all standard features. Browsing is fast and is able to find and connect to wifi fast. Phone is great overall.
