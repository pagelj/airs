I love this machine. I had misplaced the manual and mrcoffee. com doesn't have this manual on their WebSite, so I was lost and it was hard getting everything to work and to figure out how it works, but I did it.  We have had this machine for almost a week, and I just found my manual for it tonight! I am now addicted to this machine, if I could marry it, I would!  The froth works perfectly, just as it should, and it's easy to use after you know what you're doing. The ONLY thing I have a problem with is how you pull the milk container out and the coffee grounds twisting left to right.  It's hard, I'm not terribly strong, so it's a little rough on me. Either way, I should have bought this years ago!!!  LOVE THIS MACHINE!
