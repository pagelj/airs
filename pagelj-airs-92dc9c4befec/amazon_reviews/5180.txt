Excellent at this price.
The Good:-Wide Zoom Range-Low Price-Compact Size and Weight.-Good Optics/Great at this price point.-Decent Macro Performance for a Zoom-Well Constructed-Includes Lens Hood. The Bad:-Autofocus is slower and noisier than my Canon Lenses-In Dim light, It often hunts for focus. I was looking for a lens to take hiking that would replace several in my camera bag. It needed to cover a wide zoom range and be compact.  I was actually considering one of the better point and shoots, but at $200 I figured I should at least try this lens on my canon rebel. I am not disappointed. Lens is well constructed, reasonably sharp, and compact.  No, it doesn't focus like my USM canon lenses, but for what I want it for, it is a perfect lens.  I gave it 5 stars because at $200, it is a tremendous value. The outdoor shots are reasonably sharp and macros at are quite good for a zoom of this range and price. However, if you do a lot of indoor shooting, buy a faster lens - this one does not focus well in dim light.
