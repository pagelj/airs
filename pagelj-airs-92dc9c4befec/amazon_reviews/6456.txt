This is a nice collection, even with the fork. The one thing to remember about these knives is their handles are hollow so water will get inside. If they are tip up they fill up with water and it's like a faucet when you point them down. Learned that the hard way. I don't put my knives in the dishwasher, but if you do, tip down or lay flat or your will get an extra shower. They are not heavy. Due to the hollow handles all the weight is in the blade. I don't know how long they will hold their edge, I purchased an electric knife sharperner when I got these so they are sharp always. I don't see why I won't get a lot of service from this set. Like everything else in life, take care of it it may last. I've had more expensive but without a great sharpner, no knife, no matter the cost, is going to satisfy.
