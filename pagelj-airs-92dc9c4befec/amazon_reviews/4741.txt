Egg/muffin 2-slice toaster
My son and I have really enjoyed this egg/toaster. It's easy to use and clean. It's especially convenient to use while getting ready for work as you can start it and shower or dress while it's working. Your breakfast is done all at the same time. The only thing that would make it a bit nicer would be to have two egg pans instead of one. I've also used it to make hard boiled eggs and it worked great!
