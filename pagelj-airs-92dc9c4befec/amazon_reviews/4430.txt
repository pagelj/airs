Pure Awesomeness
I have a great super zoom bridge camera and sometimes I just don't want to carry it around with me because of the bulk factor.  So, I was shopping around for something I can stick into my pocket, but I also wanted performance.  I bought this at a higher price than what it is now, and all I can say is that it does not disappoint!  I took it to San Francisco while visiting my mom in the bay area, and took fantastic pictures outdoors and indoors with the upgraded CMOS sensor.  I don't think I'll be going back to CCD because of the pure speed CMOS offers.  Digic 4 produces the colors very well!  24mm wide angle helps a great deal in certain situations because there was one huge church and if I didn't have that I wouldn't have gotten all of it!  It records great video on a touch of the dedicated button, just make sure your SDHC card is fast enough.  Go for the silver or red one because the black one has a rough texture on it and it can scuff, while the others have smooth metallic finishes which make the camera look and feel better.  For me, the only con if you can call it that is the LCD screen resolution.  My bridge camera has 921K, and I would have liked at least 461k.  But, I wouldn't take a star away for that since everybody looks at their pictures on the computer anyway.
