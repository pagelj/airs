Just what I needed!
I have a droid that I use for both personal use as well as for work, so I am CONSTANTLY on it, which gives my battery about a 4 hour life per charge. which is ridiculous but this is not a review for my droid. This external battery has been a life saver. On one charge it easily keeps my phone charged constantly for about a week. If your phone accidently becomes unplugged the battery knows to shut itself off so it's great at making sure your phone gets all the power! I have a messenger bag I keep this in and with the droid connection, it was hard to keep the mini usb in the phone so I've found the easiest solution is to keep it snug by putting the phone in the bag that the battery is kept in just so it moves around less. If you're out and about and can place it on a table it's not an issue but for those of you on the go it might help!
