Love the device  - love the service even more
I recently wrote a not so nice review of the Kindle Fire's ad platform. A couple days after the post, a representative from Amazon called me and helped resolve the issue. This was totally unexpected and greatly appreciated. Great service experience and an especially great example of using these ratings to help customers. I feel compelled to keep my original post listed below, but rest assured, Amazon deserved this modification of my original rating from 2 to 5 stars. We owned another Fire so we decided to buy one for our 6-year-old daughter as well. The device itself works great but the home page with ads is very annoying and even has ads (like movie promotions) that are not appropriate for young children. If this had been disclosed I would have probably purchase a different version.
