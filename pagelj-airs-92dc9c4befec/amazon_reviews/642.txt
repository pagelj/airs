FAST
Knowing that this computer had a 750GB HDD, I ordered a Samsung 500GB SSD to go with it. After swapping the drives, this computer is faster than any computer I've ever seen. Between the USB 3.0 data transfer speeds, the speed of the OS and programs and the beautiful look the white color gives, I couldn't be happier. I use external speakers or headphones so I can't speak to the audio issue people are talking about, but everything else is perfect!
