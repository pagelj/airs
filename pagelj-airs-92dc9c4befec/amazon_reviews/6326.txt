Pebble Blue - Awesome!
Before I ordered the SGS3 I owned a SGS2 what is really great. But the SGS3 seems to beat the band. It is much better as expected. More comfortable, bigger and clearer screenand... just smarter. It's too much of paean to tribute to this phone, I would burst this place here. You can't make anything wrong buying this phone. But the price... will come down with time. And watch for your warranty! I have got NO certificate for a guaranty! (I hope, I never need)
