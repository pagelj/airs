The resin used for the Wonderwash has turned a deep yellow color, so the unit itself looks quite '70's retro.  But it was purchased in '99. At the time, we lived in an apartment and had to use a laundromat. We used it mainly for undies and bras and the like.  It will clean jeans, towels, small blankets- the problem is drying the heavier items. (I purchased a ringer. So-so on that. Wish I'd have had access to a centrifugal spin dryer. A wonderwash and one of those would be the perfect compact portable laundry solution.)  Can't underscore too much the ease of use.  Also has been used by us for dying objects.  I've used it in the tub, outside, on the kitchen counter.  Eleven years of use, still going strong. Right now it is being borrowed by a friend.  Still being used! Go Wonderwash!
