Looks decent, does its job
I was surprised at how few choices there were for Kindle Fire cover/stands when I shopped for this in Nov. 2012. This is a nice quality product and it looks good, but I'm not crazy about the design. The scored areas are tight, so I find it difficult to bend it enough to stand up at the angle I want. That will probably loosen over time. I also don't like having to pop out the corner of the device and shove it back into the tabs every time I use the stand; it seems like a lot of stress on the screen and casing. My boyfriend's older Kindle Fire cover/stand doesn't do that, but unfortunately it also doesn't fit the newer Kindle Fire, so I had to get what was available.
