Great Camera for the Price
This is a great little camera for the price.  It's wired or wireless, it tilts and swivels, it comes with a mounting bracket, it can mount upside down, you can access it from your iPhone/iPod, and it is inexpensive.  The night vision works great.  So far I've had no problems at all with it and a lot of fun.
