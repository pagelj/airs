Decent bag, but bad smell, broken snap, and generally too big
As a few other reviews mentioned, this is a decent bag but has a BAD SMELL.  The shoulder strap in particular smells terrible.  Washing the bag didn't get rid of it. I had to soak it in vinegar for a couple hours and then wash it, and now it's ok. Also, one of the side snaps broke within the first week. I happen to have a snap tool, so I just replaced the broken snap. Finally, the bag is really a bit too big.  A 15" Macbook Pro is lost in it.
