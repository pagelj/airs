I was worried with the bad reviews on this game. You don't have too buy every main pony people! But yes you can spend a bunch of money on it. But you don't have too do that stuff. Just play the free way.  Its a lot of fun. Right now I'm at level 15 or 16. forget witch but its a ton of fun! You can get apple bloom and applejack and big macintosh for bit coins! Those are the free stuff you use too buy stuff. At the beginning it will ask you to use a few gems. You have to buy these if you run out so just wait the 30 seconds and it will let you keep the gem! That's a trick I learned. You start with twilight sparkle my favorote pony! hope. this helped.
