Loved it!
I had gotten this pack for my 18th birthday for upcoming backpacking trips during the summer.  It came wrapped in plastic in a cardboard box and came out in perfect condition.  It has a ton of straps and plenty of places to but carabiners.  I wish that it had more small pockets, but that is easily fixed with stuff bags.  The hydration pouch does a good job of supporting your bladder and not allowing it to break.  The sleeping bag compartment allowed me to fit a regular sized sleeping bag in with a little bit of nudging (it wasn't in a stuff sack).  I am going to get one though, so that my sleeping bag is less likely to get wet.  The rain cover worked very well considering that I was in an infamous dolly sods rain storm.  There is plenty of cover to fit over your pad and bag.  I do suggest putting your sleeping pad on the bottom of the pack, due to when I tried to tighten mine down on the front, all the pressure was put on one corner of the bottom compression strap and some stitches popped.  I was easily able to fix this with some sewing and moving my pad down to the bottom.  I didn't experience any balance problems (that mostly depends on how you pack it) or the squeaking mentioned in some previous reviews.  The waist straps won't really go down past 30".  I have a 32" waist and I had about 2 more inches of tightening, so don't get this pack if you don't plan on being around a 30" waist.  I highly recommend this pack to anybody interested in getting into packing.  It's very comfortable and durable.  The popped stitches were my error not the pack's.  Get it you won't be disappointed!!!!
