One player would not read DVDs
These players are a great idea.  I like that you can connect them and show one movie on both screens, but I also want to ability to play different movies for our kids while on trips.  That's why I got this set.  However, one of the players I received was defective and would not read any dvd that I tried in the player.  The motor never even spun.  I returned them.  Maybe I was just unlucky...
