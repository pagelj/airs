sandisk card review
Usable space is under 8GB, which is unfortunate as I wanted the full 8, but the item works fine otherwise.  I wanted a card that would work in older equipment, and hold a lot of information.  The will do that even though it is smaller than I'd hoped.  To go larger may not be an option.  I am not unhappy with this card.
