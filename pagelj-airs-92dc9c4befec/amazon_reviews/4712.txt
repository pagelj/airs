Great product
I moved to an ultra book that has a small solid state drive.  Its fast, but can't store everything that was on my old PC.  So I put my Pictures, music, and projects files on SD cards, and have a little case to carry them in.  I found the cards to be faster than the old hard drive and I can move files to my Chromebook and work PC with ease.  I do make sure I have all the files backed up, but the portability have having three 128 GB SD cards with huge amounts of data is great!  So far I have had no errors or issues with the cards.  Their speed for read and write about the same as the Ultrabook internal SSD and way faster than the old PC drive or new 1TB portable drive I purchased.
