Grey Market Product not warrantied by Canon
I saw the lens and thought great price; but hesitated when I noted that it is shipped and sold by a third party, "Adorama Camera" ("AC"). I went to Adorama's web site and within the lens description it states:"Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Standard AutoFocus Lens - Gray Market - "Within AC's web site FAQ:What is the Grey Market?"Grey Market," also known as "direct import," are products imported directly into the U. S., and not through the manufacturer's authorized agent/distributor. There is no factory-authorized middleman involved in the import of these products, so the costs are lower. Are there any disadvantages of "Grey Market" goods? Because there is no factory-authorized middleman, there is no manufacturer's warranty. However, "Grey Market" products purchased from Adorama are warrantied by Adorama Camera and are returned to Adorama Camera for any warranty repair. I am not disparaging AC... just stating I would prefer a manufacturer warranty on new products and that new products not covered by a manufacturer's warranty should EXPLICITLY state this within the product description on Amazon's web site. Based on earlier reviews (many of the reviewer stated the lens is not very sturdy)  the warranty is very important on this product.
