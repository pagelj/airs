easy, effective and quick. what else could you want?
this shapener dosnt give a better sharpen than a flat stone but then nothing else dose. however, it gives a very sharp edge and its is extreamly quick. I use the sharpener just before I use my cooking knives, a quick two or three swipes and its sharp and ready to go. i bought this product after trying it at my fater in-laws and we both love it. deffinatly good for more than the monye paid, the deffinition of good deal.
