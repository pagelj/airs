Nice Knives
I did alot of reading and research before purchasing a set of knives. I wanted to balance quality and price. This set was my final decision and I am completely sastified. These are not flimsy knives, they arrived sharp and regain their edge quickly with a few swipes across the sharpener. They even included sharpening instructions for those who are unsure of how to properly sharpen a knife.
