Just what I needed!
I just got my very first surround sound system, and didn't know how to set it up. A friend of mine told me that I needed this cable to make my home theater system work all the time, not just when i'm watching bluray. All you have to do is connect this cable from your Cable box or Satellite receiver to your home theater system. Pretty simple!
