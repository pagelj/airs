A Great Resource for Guitarists
I purchased this to learn how to do my own setups and maintenance on my guitar.  This book has allowed me to do that and then some.  I'd highly recommend that anyone that is tired of paying for maintenance and repairs on their guitars pick this book up and start learning to do it yourself.  It'll save you money and you won't have to leave your guitars with a guitar tech for days at a time.
