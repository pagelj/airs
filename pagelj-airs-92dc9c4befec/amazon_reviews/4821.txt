Love the look!  Would buy again!
I LOVE this toaster  - it looks great on my countertop!  You know - it works pretty well - I do have some slight issues when I toast a bagel - when I toast at level 3 or above - there is a dark spot at the bottom of each bagel.  To solve this - I put it on a lower setting (with the bagel button pushed) - pop it up - then rotate them.  Comes out perfect that way... even on higher settings.  I don't know if the heat wires are uneven inside - or what causes this - but you know - I feel I was more paying the price for the looks and the ability to have a toaster that has accessories, like the sandwich cage and warming rack - both of which I have, and am happy with.  I don't think any toaster is going to be perfect - and I would buy this one again... I really do like it.  Also - I love that when the toast pops up - it is extremely quiet when it does.
