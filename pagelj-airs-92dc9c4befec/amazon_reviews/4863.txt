I wanted to be able to vacuum my steps without hauling my heavy upright (Wind tunnel) up on every tread.  Done.  I like the retractable cord... and the color (RED is my fav).  When the canister is in the upright position it likes to topple over.  Most of the time it topples on to its power cord retraction button..... ooops!  If you leave the handle/sweeper standing, you must rotate the handle to keep the whole thing from falling over.  It does not fit under my sofa... boooo!... but it does fit under all of my beds... which is great.  Now I can dump that junko Rumba which requires more babying that a two month old. I like the quick release wand and love the head light. It is QUIET :o) yaaaaaayyyy!  The thing I hated most about vacuuming was the noise. I CAN NOT find the "C" bags at Target or Home Depot... grrrr... and since the bags are small, I'm going to need new ones soon. I really would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I guess once I figure out how to keep it from falling over, and find some bags... it would be a 4 to 4.5. K
