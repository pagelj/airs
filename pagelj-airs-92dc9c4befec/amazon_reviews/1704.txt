Great Backpack !
Purchased this backpack to use as my emergency pack. Holds everything I need for 3 day supply with room to spare. Very sturdy and is holding the 45-50 lbs of stuff in it very well. Very comfortable even with that amount of weight. Great pack for the price. If you're thinking about purchasing one, jump on it!
