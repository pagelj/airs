I was sceptical to order this product but since I heard only good reviews and really needed a high quality vac... thought what else can I loose. The price was quite reasonable compare to the other listed items on the Miele brand. The vac does work well on wood and rugs which I do not have any complaints. But as one reviewer mentioned, the cord was a bit short and therefore have to use an extension cord to cover area being cleaned. It solved from plugging and unplugging. As for the noise factor, it is less noisy but it is not quiet as some has stated. Just more tolerable. Easy to handle. I recommend.
