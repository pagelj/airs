Like it MUCH better than the LaCie "Rikiki"
As a Mac computer tutor, I am fortunate to have experiences with LOTS of different computers, applications and accessories owned by my clients. I had been quite happy with LaCie's Rikiki until I discovered that they have a tendency to break soon after the warranty expires. That has happened to me three times in the past two months. When I called LaCie, they apologized but kind of implied "Well, that's the way the old cookie crumbles."The crowning blow with LaCie came last week when a brand new Rikiki wouldn't connect to a brand new iMac. I had my client re-box it and send it back -- Amazon was really good about exchanging it. Hopefully, the replacement will work -- but this is the end of my relationship with LaCie. I have lost confidence in the quality of their products. I am giving Western Digital a try. So far, so good. It's as small as the Rikiki. Had a longer connection cable. Is priced similarly. And is actually faster! I'll post an update after a few months -- hopefully still having good news!
