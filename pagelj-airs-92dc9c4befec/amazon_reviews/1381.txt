I was lucky and my sister has had one of these for some time. Big coffee drinker where I am not. However after much research. Got mine at Bi-mart for 39.99 and very happy with it. She had a little hint which I have used to prevent coffee grounds from going on lid. I put another coffee filter on top. I cut around the edges. She is very fussing and always finds ways to improve things. Little problems made easy. I was ready to buy 29.99 frother and saw a Mr Coffee for 3.99 so thought I would give it a try. This will work for me and I appreciate all other people who gave their input, was very helpful
