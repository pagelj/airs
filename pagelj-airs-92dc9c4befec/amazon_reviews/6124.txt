Great Backpack!
I'm a college student and this backpack is able to hold my 17" laptop, charger, school books, and a few other things. This bag has special padding on its back and shoulder straps which allows air to flow through to provide extra comfort and help prevent sweat from building up on your back and soaking into your clothes in the heat. This bag also has 2 additional straps that go across the waist and upper chest to help secure it to your body, but the strap across the waist can be tucked away in a special pouch if you're not into that kind of thing. I have an average build for a male, and even though this bag is a larger version of some of another that High Sierra sells, it doesn't stick past my shoulders or waist so it's not going to look "packed" if you need to carry quite a bit. Additionally there is another pouch at the bottom of the bag which contains a rain cover (yellow) that goes around the entire bag. I don't use it, because it rarely rains where I'm located, but because it's stored at the bottom of the bag it provides an extra layer of impact protection for my laptop. Overall I like the backpack a lot and chose this one because I needed a large bag to hold a 17" laptop. I have been using a smaller version of this backpack for 8 years, so I know it's of good quality and very durable.
