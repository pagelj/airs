Exceptional Hard Drive
This was my first time owning an external hard drive, I was in desperate need of space and began researching different drives online. My first choice was a Seagate, I looked at the reviews, the good and the bad, and then researched Western Digital drives. I found that most of the negative reviews for these drives just come from the software included, defective drives, poor care, bad customer support, or problems with the 1TB ones. I knew this was the drive for me when compared to the Seagate drives. I use these external drives only for storage, so I don't use the software included at all, since it's not that good. The speed of transfer is ok (for a USB 2.0 transfer speed.) I really like how these drives are powered just by the usb ports on your computer, though, some older laptops/computers may have problems not supplying enough power to the drive, rendering them useless to the particular laptop/computer. When the drive is not in use, the tiny light on the drive will start blinking slowly, indicating that it's currently on standby, this was probably implemented to preserve power and to prolong the life of the drive. The drives are not heavy at all, and are quite durable. I now own two WD External Drives (500GB), and both perform great and are running fine to this day. One of them was even dropped (by a clumsy friend) about 3 feet high and still works fine. If you want a reliable External Drive, consider a Western Digital. UPDATE: I NOW PURCHASED A 1TB DRIVE, AND IT ALSO WORKS WONDERS. Thanks Western Digital for your reliable Hard Drives!
