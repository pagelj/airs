I love it!
This screen is way better then the anti glare one. I recommend over the anti glare on hands down. It feels good when I slide my finger across the scsreen, with this product on. One thing that I don't like about the design is that it has too many corners. Corners are more likely to get lifted up, even if you put the screen on perfect. When I was using the Anti Glare on, it started to lift from around the button from putting the phone in my jeans pocket. And no, i don't wear tight jeans, I wear relaxed fit jeans so its was easy to put the phone in my pocket.
