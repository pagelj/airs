Great Cable!!
Great Cable. I used it on my cable box for hdtv with my 57in Mitsubishi. Great picture(Bout the same as component cables),but with the component cables I had to crank up the volume just to barely hear it. I hooked up this cable and it fixed it. Don't waste your money on other cables. I even bought the blue cables to go just in case and they actually seemed to have a worse picture quality.
