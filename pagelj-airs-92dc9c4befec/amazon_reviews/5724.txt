A good shoot them up story
The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is a welfare state full of slums with little hope. In contrast, the world is colonizing far off worlds to push humanity into the stars and provide "New World" opportunities. This is the setting for a young man who joins the military and goes to war. The author crafts a wonderful set of characters, world building par excellence, and a steady plot which pushes the story forward with my full attention. I will avoid spoilers and just mention you experience a realistic view of basic training and solid combat scenarios. The author is effective as making everything believable and interesting with regard to the military setting. My chief compliant is the next book is not available yet.
