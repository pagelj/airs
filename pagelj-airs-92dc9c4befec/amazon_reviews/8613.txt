Works, it's cheap, what's not to like?
The charging cord for the Sylvania DVD player is really short--I guess if you're in a Mini Cooper it would do the job, but that's about it. We've got a minivan, so this was a REQUIRED purchase if we were going to charge the DVD players in their headrest positions. No problems so far, and we've been using them every day for the past 3 months.
