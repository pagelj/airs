I did a TON of research before buying a new vacuum and setttled on this one with all the great reviews. I have to say that I have been very disappointed. Not long after I started using it, the suction stopped all together. I finally called Bissell and found that there were not one, not two, but FIVE places that things could get stopped up enough to slow or stop suction. Ours was in the wand, which I had no idea would stop the suction of the entire thing, but it did then and has multiple times since. And when I empty the canister, I have to empty THREE different (very messy) filters. No thanks! Besides that major issue, it does a really bad job going from wood floors to rugs/carpets. I have to pick it up to get over the lip of the rug and it misses anything that is near the edge. It also can't seem to pick up anything but tiny particles of hair and dirt off the ground - for instance a crumb or piece of paper that is on the floor will just get pushed around and not sucked up. I am extremely frustrated with this vacuum and would not recommend it. I previously had a Dirt Devil and next time I will most definitely go back to that as it seemed to be much more user friendly!
