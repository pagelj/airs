Wife an I have been very happy with our purchase of the Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee maker. I was a little concerned given the product's cost was on the low end of the self grinding coffee makers but have been very happy with it. Like others have mentioned the grinder can be a bit on the loud side (but no worse than a regular coffee grinder). Brews quickly and the coffee taste great. I would recommend (and have) to friends and family. Enjoy!
