The product speaks for itself
This product speaks for itself. Read the other reviews, don't be fooled by people who may have had one defective cable. I purchased 5, just because of the price. I have 3 HD tv's and these cables on all, my Sony blu-ray is hooked up with a Monster Platinum Series cable to a Sharp Aquos 46" 120hz tv, and that cable was just a waste of money, the picture and quality is identical. If you don't believe just buy one anyway, and buy a monster and try for yourself. at under $2, how can you not try one?
