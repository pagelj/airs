An early review
I got my 360 HD-DVD player off the shelf at CC. We all complain about Microsoft for the things they do wrong. For example: The 360 console has marginal quality. The break down rate is unacceptable (I'm on my 2nd), it's noisy, ect... all the problems we constantly read about in the forums. However Microsoft has gotten a few things right; the 360 controller is an ergonomic piece of art, by far the best game controller I've ever used. The wireless adapter it's another thing; easy to set up, great range, great design and reliable. So far the 360 HD-DVD player seems to be another thing Microsoft got right. It plugs right in and the picture quality is amazing. The colors are vivid and crisp. The feature that lets you access options while viewing the movie is great and works flawlessly. There are however, some minor issues: The dashboard and remote should have a separate botton to open and close the HD tray. Both by default open and close the console tray. Also the plug from the power adapter to the player does not fit firmly and seems kind of flimsy. In the long run this could cause problems. It's way to early to make a judgement on reliability but considering you get a $25.00 dollar movie included and a remote which sells separately at a way overpriced $29.95 dollars, the 360 HD-DVD player is a great value for the money. I definitely recommend this product for movie buffs and early adopters.
