My new favorite walk around lens
This is an amazing lens. I have had the 24-70 on my D3 for years and today it is being replaced by the 28-300. I was always looking for a bit more reach with the 24-70 and was always having to settle for the less reach and try and save the photo in photoshop by cutting out all the things I did not want in the image. Now I can compose with no limits. I shot some sample in a dark room in the house and was stunned again at what I was able to capture. Granted the D3 has a higher iso so take that into consideration. But for me for now, this lens is my new best friend.
