Great card, good read/write speed rates.
I use this card with my OMD EM5 almost on a daily basis. I shoot on RAW+JPEG 100% of the time as well as FUll HD settings for video. This card is fast enough to handle FullHD video + stills without a hiccup. Once back at home, I can load the pix and videos on my workstation in a jiff. No problems whatsoever, no lost files, no skipped frames, etc. Definitely a great choice.
