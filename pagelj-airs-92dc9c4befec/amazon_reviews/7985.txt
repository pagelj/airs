This Dirt Devil Versa Power All-in-One Stick Vacuum is awesome at cleaning up messes off of my kitchen floor! I use it after every meal and it does the job. I have a 2 1/2 yr old and a 16 month old so quite a mess gets made each day. I also noticed after the first time using it in my kitchen and emptying everything it had picked up into the garbage, there was a lot of dust it had picked up that when I had used a broom before, the broom didn't get. Wonderful product and one happy mom!
