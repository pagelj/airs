Love It
Both my son and brother-in-law highly recommended the COOLPIX S9200 and I am very satisfied that I finally purchased it. I bought it a couple of months ago after my camera crashed and had to wait until a friend brought the camera in March to Uganda, East Africa where I live. I have had it about a week and love it. It has everything I was looking for and more. It is a great camera for taking photos of the children that I work with and love.
