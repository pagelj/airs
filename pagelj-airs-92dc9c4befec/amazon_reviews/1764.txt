Wonderful Novel
What a delightful read!  An enjoyable story guaranteed to keep you reading late until the night.  I'm not the type of reviewer that likes to give away plots but this is a novel of jealousy, deceit, love, and even redemption.  I thought the story was well written and engrousing.  The antagonist was deliciously bad (evil even) and I laughed out loud when she finally received her just dues- what a mean character!
