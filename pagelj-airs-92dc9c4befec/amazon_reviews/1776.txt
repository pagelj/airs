I was a crop junkie!
Hello Amazon reviewers! I think by now you have read the reviews and seen all the pros/cons of a new purchase or upgrade. Most magazines have already deemed this "camera of the year" for 2012, yes even over the Nikon D800 (lets not get into a discussion about this, I did not write the review). What I wanted to mention is the ding ding wake up call. What do I mean? For all of you DSLR people pimping your cropped sensor ride (Canon 7D, etc) to get the most out of it to satisfy your mind that you are close to the full frame, WAKE UP and smell the coffee. Why? I talk from experience, because I was there. I started with the Canon Rebel (first digital), then to a Canon 50D, added quite a few extras, then went to the crop Canon flagship 7D with all the extras, cards, you name it. In my mind I was close to full frame, and was happy. Then I tried the Canon 5D Mark III. I shot, edited, viewed, and then the bubble popped. I found myself quickly realizing FULL FRAME is the name of the game. I will not go on any more, just saying, if you are a crop sensor and do "some" shooting, then your fine. If you are shooting, and are striving for the next level, then stop the mini upgrades, and slip into a 5D. You will wonder why all this time you drove on the bumpy road. Everyone who wants to comment on how fabulous their crop pictures are, I am sure they are all of that, what I am saying is there is an easier road to get there, plus more.
