A great introduction to a great series
After reading this book, I was completely hooked on Honor.  There are two great qualities to this work and the other books in the series, The internally consistant and well explained technology, and Weber's complete  lack of concern for wiping out characters.  As far as the first one goes,  I, for one, appreciate greatly the explainations of how the technology  works, why the tactics are such as they are, and how these ships are  fought.  Some may see it as techno-babble, but a few years ago so were RAM,  CPU, and all the other terms that we now use in casual conversation.  Second, I really appreciate how Weber has no problem with killing his  characters.  In the situations that Honor gets herself and her crews into,  some people aren't going to come back.  The main characters are in  dangerous situations, and some of them get bitten.  Good!  Now, if Mr  Weber would only write the next ones faster.
