Corinthians in action
If asked to find the book of Hosea in the Bible, most people would look kind of blank, and after reading it the only thing many would say was her name was GOMER? Francine Rivers brings the story forward a few thousand years to tell the story of Sarah, [an illegitimate child] of a whore in the Gold Rush era. Sold into the same slavery as her mother, Sarah quickly loses her identity and innocence, becoming the fallen Angel who is sold to the highest bidder night by night. Her rescue comes from a young man who sees the lost child within the pagan goddess, Michael Hosea. Like the ancient prophet, he claims her for his bride, renaming her several times, Mara (bitter), Tirzah (Desire), and finally Amanda, worthy of love. Angel can not believe herself worthy of love, and fights him every step of the way. Her past continues to drag her away from him, and she seeks to escape often. Yet, every time, he brings her home, fighting equally hard for her love. Even when Amanda begins to love, she believes herself so fallen and unworthy that leaving would be best, but now not for her, but for him. Yet, like God, Michael does not agree, and still fights for her. I strongly reccommend this as a witnessing tool. People who won't talk about God might still be compelled by this story and then you can hit them with the allegory.
