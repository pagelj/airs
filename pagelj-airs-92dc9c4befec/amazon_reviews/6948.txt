I give Hyperion (the trilogy) an augmented 10 out of 10!
Hyperion should NOT be read apart from its "sequels."  In fact, the three books are so closely linked that they are not really sequels:  they are a single story in three volumes. My review is based on the three volumes as a whole, and I give them a collective "10."  If you are a lover of intelligent sci-fi, then these books are for you. So why do I give these books a 10?  Hmmm, many reasons: 1. It WILL expand your ideas about what reality could be. 2. It will make your feel emotions you've not felt before.  (When I finished the section about Paul Dure on the tree I had to put the book down for a while in order to reflect on what I had just read! Good Grief!  I can't believe someone can imagine stuff like this! Thank you, Dan.) 3. The sci-fi part is great!  How about those faster-than-light ships that accelerate so fast that the only way to fly is through resurrection? 4.  It has great hard action sequences.  I will never forget the battle between the Shrike and Nemes. (What a babe?!) Sheesh, can anyone really review this trilogy adequately?  There's nothing like it.
