I have had this for about a month now, and I cannot believe how well it works for the money. The 15 bar pressure is key to get the true crema, and this unit delivers. I use two espresso pods that cost me about .33 each to make a double shot latte for less than a buck each morning. The time to make this his about the same as brewing coffee and requires more direct attention, but I now look forward to the whole zen of both making my latte and cleaning up the machine. This true espresso machine costs less than a decent drip coffee maker; you will save the price of it over a year just in coffee costs! Yes, it's kind of tiny to work with, and the steamer is a bit close to the counter, but the quality is excellent all the way around. If there is one thing that worries me, it is that the steamer end is made of plastic. And, since you need to remove it to clean it, I worry that the threads will eventually wear out. So far so good, though! Edit: I forgot, the reason I am even back here is because I am buying a second one for our cottage. :-)
