The Bad: It left a horrible, scary smell and taste to coffee and/or water. I rinsed the machine out multiple times--more than the instructions recommended. I changed coffees. I rinsed it out some more. The smell and taste persisted. Unfortunately, we are returning this machine. The Good: I'm sad that it couldn't make a good, safe cup of coffee. The design and simplicity is fabulous. There are two scoops, so making two cups in the morning is a breeze. It makes coffee quickly (a little more slowly, naturally, if you are brewing stronger coffee.) It rinses out easily. No water sits waiting because it only uses the cup's worth of water that you pour into it. I am really sorry that I have to return this machine. But I am actually afraid to drink anything that goes through this machine. More Good: Amazon has a really simple return process.
