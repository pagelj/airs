Can't wait for the movie and the next book
I read this and Insurgent back to back, and I am so glad that I did. I can see why people say that it is close to "The Hunger Games" but it is more about the mystery of what is going on in the government where you can see right through President Snow. The love story between Four and Tris is also heartbreaking. A must read.
