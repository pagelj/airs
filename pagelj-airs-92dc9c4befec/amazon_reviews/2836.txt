We purchased this toaster probably two years ago and have gone through 4 units in that time. There were electrical issue where the toaster ceased working. We received a replacement toaster that had a K-Mart sticker on the box and crumbs in the bottom tray. And our latest toaster stopped toasting after about 6 months. Time to move on to a new toaster...
