cBear External USB DVD/CD-ROM RW Drive for Netbook, Choice of Colors
I ordered a cBear External CD-ROM/DVD RW Drive for Netbook, Choice of Colors. It arrived well ahead of time; works very well; is easy to use. I could not be happier with its performance. cBear enclosed sufficient information for this plug and play item. The good folks at cBear should really emphasize how light weight it is and takes up very little space on a desk. It also travels well. Now, I do have to add that my Acer Netbook is Onyx Blue (like Midnight Blue) so the color choice option was important to me as a second concern. cBear has a very good range of color options for this. I did get to browse some of their other products when I was searching for this external drive. The good folks at cBear have a good selection. I am definitely considering cBear first for any other computer accessory needs. Great customer service and very prompt. I like these guys.
