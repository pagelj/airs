not happy
I am somewhat disappointed in this camera..  First of all the camera feels rather cheap. , plastic.  Secondly the pop-up flash is in an awkward place.  Right where you hold the camera .  I'd say, having owned a Panasonic, the Sony lens isn't as good ..  If I hadn't already returned one camera i would have returned this one also. Linda Allen
