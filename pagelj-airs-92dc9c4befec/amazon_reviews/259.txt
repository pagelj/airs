does the job well.
Though I agree a camera app should have been included, this developer should not be punished for a decision by Amazon. That being said, I needed an app to record video, and this app did it easily and without issue. As a bonus, it includes a shortcut to your recorded videos, which I still can't figure out how to get to without this app. Until Amazon includes a comparable video cam app, I recommend this one.
