I used the vacuum for the first time today and when I depressed the switch to deactivate rollers nothing happened.  The rollers kept turning.  The vacuum does have good suction and not as heavy as my past Windtunnel vacuum.  Another problem is the short 12" extension wand.  Not long enough for any good.  Like the other reviewer I have to use the extension wands from my other vacuum.  Also the Pet hair attachment uses rubber beaters instead of bristle brushes like my previous Windtunnel vacuum.  I like the retractable cord, we'll have to see how long it takes to break.  All in all sort of disappointed in this model.
