Temperature Does Not Work
The reason I paid extra for this monitor was so I could keep an eye on the room temp. I have separate units on each level of the house for heating and cooling and the baby is on a separate floor from me. When I read the monitor it says the baby's room is in the 80's even though I have the AC blasting and set at 72 degrees. I go into the room and its freezing but the monitor is saying 84 degrees. Anyway now I have to constantly go into the room through out the night to make sure it's not too hot or cold for him. Very annoying!!!!
