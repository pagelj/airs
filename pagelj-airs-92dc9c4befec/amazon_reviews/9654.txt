Deff not the best out there.
It looks really cool in the pictures but its actually crap. Its thin plastic?? And the fans have no covering underneath so you can not try to put in to your lap or you'll get yourself cuts. Its basically just cheap all around. I was definitely expecting better. The only positive thing is that you actually get what you pay for, a cheap product. Also the shipping sucks. I live in an apartment, and they can not leave your package so you have to be home when they come or leave a door hanger card, but by time they get there it will be gone. I would no recommend this product to anyone. There are plenty more on here!
