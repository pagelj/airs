Top quality. No complaints
---Edit July 11:---Something is different with the finish on this screen... It seems to be missing the oleophobic coating since it collects more fingerprints and oil than the original. Not a deal breaker at this price point, but something to keep in mind.---Original review:---This assembly is a perfect replacement in every way. No issues with fitting or picture quality. I did some side-by-side comparisons with another iPhone 4 screen and absolutely nothing is different. I'd venture a guess and say that this part is actually OEM. No instructions come bundled, but pull up a helpful youtube video and follow along. The process is quite tedious, but with patience and a clean workbench, you should be fine. The ONLY problem DYIers may run into is that newer iPhones have two slightly different screw heads at the bottom of the phone. If you have the strange dimpled star type heads (vs '+' philips), you'll need to find that tool elsewhere. For the price, though, this part is definitely worth it. I have absolutely no complaints. Last note: DO NOT forget to transfer your speaker grill mesh once you have the old screen out. It does not affect functionality after assembly, but if you forget it, you'll have shiny metal bits staring at you through the earpiece. It's not worth pulling your phone apart again to put it in, but it leaves your phone slightly less than perfect (though, a broken screen is probably 100x worse).
