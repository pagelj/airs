A fine washing machine this is. Quiet, efficient and thorough. Easy to use. Large enough for bulky comforters. I have nothing bad to say about this machine. I purchased it for $627 before a $40 rebate so it actually cost $587. Clothes come out clean and drier than other machines due to the high spin cycle, and as a consequence, need less time to dry in the dryer. 5 temperature settings and the 8 wash settings are plenty. Extremely happy with my purchase and I highly recommend this product.
