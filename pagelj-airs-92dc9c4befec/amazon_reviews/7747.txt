I Misjudged This Item.
In my original review, I did not give it a good review. Now a couple of months have passed by, and this little cam is still working better than expected. You will get a better quality of video if you use a class 10 sd card. it still is not HD as they stated, but is good enough. Someone else's review indicted they could not make out license plates, well, I have no problem making out numbers and letters. I would buy second unit.
