Okay if you have a smaller TV
I don't recommend this mount if your TV is 65inch or larger (I've used it with a 65 and 70 inch Vizio). It worked okay when I used it to to hang my old 42inch plasma for testing (it was able to fully tilt). It's just okay if used without the tilt, but in order to use the full tilt capacity with my 70inch TV I had to bolt risers made from 2x4 lumber to get the TV far enough away from the wall. Without the risers the bottom edge of the TV contacted the wall which prevented it from titling completely.  Another downside is that there isn't any means to adjust the set for level after hanging it on the mount (and making sure the mount is level doesn't mean that the TV will be level when hung on it). It's impossible to use the locking screws to secure the TV to the mount if the mount is tilted to full capacity, which is a design flaw. If I had to do it again, I'd buy an articulating tilting mount that allowed for leveling. I'm going to have to make some kind of shim to level my TV. Another ding on this Cheetah mount was that a nut and bolt had come undone and were rattling around inside the packaging. The upsides to this mount are its' low price and the included HDMI cable (which works perfectly).
