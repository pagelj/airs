Wow. That is all.
This camera is amazing. I've been playing with the settings and uploading and sending - all kinds of stuff!!  I found a webpage that has some beautiful photos of a gray fox baby and it's clear as day on 20X optical zoom (http://www. squidoo. com/how-to-take-really-foxy-photos) which I thought was awesome.  My own photos don't have such interesting characters :P But they are still as awesome! Thanks Canon and Amazon!
