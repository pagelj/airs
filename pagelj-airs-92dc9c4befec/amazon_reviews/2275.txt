Olympus Zuiko 70-300
I thought I would give this lens a try and was very pleased with the clarity and magnification.  It would be nice if the lens was faster but for the price and combination with my E-3's internal image stablization, I can shoot clear focus images with wonderful clarity while hand holding at the 600mm equlivant focal length even while moving in a car!  Definately worth the price.
