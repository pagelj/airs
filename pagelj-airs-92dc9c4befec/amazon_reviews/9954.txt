Functions very well
This is a quality product and it gets lots of use.  The only complaints are that it indicates the preheating is complete before the desired temperature is reached as checked by an oven thermometer.  So, I regularly wait a few minutes after it indicates preheating is done and I also set the oven temperature about 30 degrees warmer than the recipe calls for -- with good results.
