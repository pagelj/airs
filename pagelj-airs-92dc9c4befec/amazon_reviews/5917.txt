Analog Sunset - Component Video (RGB) Output Users Beware
It may not be fair to post this specifically to the Sony BDP S580 sales site, but by ALMOST purchasing this player I discovered an important change in standards that impacts my (and perhaps your) system.  This review applies to ANY Blu-ray player manufactured after 1/1/2011.  If you are upgrading your aging DVD player to a Blu-ray player and use component video outputs (Red, Green, Blue cords) this player will NOT support 1080i or 1080p to your television for protected content.  You will only get this resolution via the HDMI output.  Yes, my television supports HDMI, but my receiver does not.  If you don't believe me, just look at the manual for this player at [...].  On page 22 it states the following: "When connecting via the COMPONENT VIDEO OUT jack and [Component Video] is selected, BD-ROM playback of protected content is only supported at 480i output resolution."You'll find a pretty good explantion from Consumer Reports here, [...] but here is a summary:"After decades of effort, Hollywood is finally "plugging the analog hole," as it's inelegantly been called, thanks to new restrictions imposed by the licensing administrator for the AACS, the copy-protection scheme used in Blu-ray players. For example, as of January 1st of this year, manufacturers have not been permitted to make new Blu-ray players with component-video jacks capable of outputting high-definition (HD) video; instead, video sent via the component outputs is limited to SD (standard definition, either 480i or 576i). Existing models in the lineup with HD component-video connections can be sold through 2013, but starting in 2014, no new models will have any analog video outputs. Hence the term "analog sunset."Do what you like with this information.  I scrambled to pick up a Sony BDP S570.  A great player with basically the same technology but without the restriction on component video.
