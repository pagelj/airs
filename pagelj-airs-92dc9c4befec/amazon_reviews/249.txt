Great except for backing
This product is great, holds great, makes my phone quite a bit bigger then I was expecting, but nothing to stop me from using it. Looks exactly as picture. My only issue is that the back stand, very cheaply made. 90% of the time, I can't even get it out, as you only have two little spots to try to get your finger in and pull it out. It sticks most of the time. I even used a pen to try to get it out, broke the pen. When you do manage to get it out, be careful not to pull to hard or you may break the stand right off.
