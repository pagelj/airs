Love this 2.8" video monitor with easy access volume buttons
We debated long and hard or which video monitor to buy. We researched all of the models and we picked this one. I love the idea that we can expand to more than one camera when we want to. The 2.8" screen is great - I personally didn't think it was worth it for an extra $50 for a slightly larger screen. The benefit to getting the 2.8" screen is the menu buttons. Other reviewers stated adjusting the volume levels in the middle of the night was impossible or very hard to do with the 3.5" one. The Amazon stock image for the 2.8" screen is not accurate. There ARE volume and brightness buttons on the left and the image shows arrow buttons. So with the smaller screen, you are able to easily adjust the volume without having to navigate through the menus as described for the 3.5" version. Yes it is true that the volume will not turn off completely as other reviewers stated. I can't see why that would be a bad thing though. Baby monitors are used to hear the baby and be alerted when baby needs to be checked on. If you want to turn off the sound, then turn off the monitor. The image quality is great although I haven't used other video monitors to compare it against. The night vision is very good as well. The temperature readout is a great feature to have and the battery seems to be lasting for a long time. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase. I only wish it wasn't so expensive but I really think it is worth it if you want a good quality video monitor.
