This trash can exceeded my expectations.  I read all the reviews before deciding to purchase it and I also ones on all the other brands of touchless trash cans on amazon. com before deciding to go with this one.  I selected it after reading complaints about other cans, such as walking by and the lid automatically going up, which people found annoying.  Nine Stars trash cans received consistently high reviews and justifiably so.  Everything about it is great.  When you put your hand by the front, it automatically goes up and only then.  If you walk by or near it, it doesn't open up--which I do frequently throughout the day.  It's so easy to change the bag, and the frame inside is easy to remove when replacing the bag .  It's so easy to add a new one around the frame and the bag is totally hidden inside so nothing shows outside.  It also has a generous capacity for such a slim looking trash can.  You can't go wrong with this one--or probably with any of the other models.
