i dont care about extras, this is great
i really dont care about 40 minutes of outtakes and special features and interviews with the cast and all the other stuff.  for twenty bucks and get both blu and regular dvd, its a bargain on an awesome film.  this is spectacular special effects and the movie is all i want.  get this and you will be happy!
