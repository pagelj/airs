Bricked My Wife's Device
DO NOT BY ANY MEANS PURCHASE THIS PRODUCTI consider myself rather tech savvy, so I'm no stranger to modifying hardware and making repairs/upgrades. After replacing my wife's cracked 4S screen with this one the phone would not boot whatsoever, even on the charger it would simply vibrate and chirp. I can only assume the generic cheap components fired the MoBo.
