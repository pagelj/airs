My favorite camera ever!
I have been using Canon digital cameras since 2005, after many years of using Pentax SLRs. My hands are small, I am left-handed, and as one reviewer said somewhere, there is a great "Canony" feel and user-friendliness to them. I also NEED an optical viewfinder, which many other manufacturers did not include with their digital point and shoots, because most of my personal photography is outdoor. (Hopefully in the sun.) I still keep my little SD 1000 in my purse at all times, just in case! Anyway - at the end of 2010, Canon also had dropped its optical viewfinders on all but it's higher end cameras. So, with promises of an easy to read display, and a good bridge-type of zoom, I tried an SX 130. Good camera, but I really missed my optical viewfinder. Also had purchased a Panasonic high-def camcorder that did not have an optical viewfinder. After almost 2 years of giving these a fair chance, I got an email from Amazon about the SX40 HS, and started researching and dreaming about it. Finally bought from Amazon in February, 2012. I have used it on trips and on local birds and more. It is my favorite camera since my old A95, and of course I like the SX 40 HS even better due to the optical zoom capability. Amazing night and low light photography! Excellent high def video that is beautiful on a high def TV. I know that some people have complained that it only uses . jpeg files, and long-term I may miss this. However, I have found that I've used the . jpeg for about 95% of my digital photo needs over the past few years, and haven't needed anything else since I retired. Thank you Amazon and Canon for my perfect camera
