GREAT Protectors!
These are awesome for the price and work great! They have a great feel to them not hard to slide your finger across and the screen quality is awesome! They are easy to install and have two plastic covers one on each side. The holes lined up perfectly and a hard cardboard card was provided to put the screen on with. It also came with a cloth to "clean" the screen before hand, but I found that the cloth left some fibers behind, so I just used paper towel and some Windex to clean the screen good before application. I've had it for a couple of days now and cant tell that its on. I haven't had any problem with the corners pealing up or anything. It makes my iPhone look shiny and new, I will definitely buy more for my other devices!!!
