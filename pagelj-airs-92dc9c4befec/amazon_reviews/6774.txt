I received a round 30L can for Christmas that broke several times; I repaired it the third time and called Simplehuman toll free to get a replacement pedal. The new pedal was free and received in about a week; its made of metal and should last the lifetime of the rest. Give it a light coat of silcone spray and wipe it down.
