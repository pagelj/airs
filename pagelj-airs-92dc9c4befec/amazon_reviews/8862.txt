Very good camera for the price.
I found this camera to be a good value for the price. I have not figured out all the settings that this camera has but am happy with most of the results I have got with this camera. It would be easier to have a manual that explains the various settings and how to use them instead of having to go online to look it up. This practice of manufactures just adding a manual for basic operation is a BIG NEGATIVE ON RATINGS. I want to know how to use all the products functions without having to go online. I want to have a manual in my hands for looking up the different functions and how and when to use them out in the field when I don't have online access. This is something that all manufactures should do for the consumers satifaction,they have the full manual online so to save costs they give you manuals that are very basic and really of no use to the consumer. So to all manufactures don't be so cheap start giving the consumer a full manual with your products. I don't believe That I am the only one who feels this way on this subject.
