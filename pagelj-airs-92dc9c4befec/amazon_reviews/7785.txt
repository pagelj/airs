Canon EOS 7D
I love this Camera! Is is perfect for any type of photographic imagry one can imagine. It is another example of Canon's ability to produce an excellent product. I have used several different types of traditional 35mm SLRs (Olympus, Nikon and Canon) in the past and was a bit leary converting over to digital. I have used two smaller Canon digitials (non-slr) for just routine family shots and to have a camera to keep in my pocket for those "quick" shots. I was impressed with those, so decided to take the leap and purchase the EOS 7D. So far it has operated flawlessly. I love the resolution plus the variety of other features. Haven't tried it yet with acessory flash equipment but that is next.
