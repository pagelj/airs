Great!
I got this cable to connect my Macbook to my TV. It was cheap and had good reviews, and I have nothing negative to add. the cables worked perfectly and the quality of the picture was outstanding. So excited to be able to watch my online shows on the big screen. Great quality and fast shipping! Thanks!
