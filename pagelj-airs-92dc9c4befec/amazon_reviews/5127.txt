Died on vacation
While on vacation, this SDHC card failed after 65 photos. Was lucky enough to be in a foreign city when the card failed, but had to purchase another card at a premium. The photos were recovered but only after purchasing recovery software. Sometimes what seems like a great value isn't one.
