Performs as well as expected
Overall I'm mostly happy - it works with only minor usability niggles, ISO6400 is usable, and optical quality is quite good.  Battery life is weak, as expected. Bear in mind that, as a video camera, it's not great - it'll randomly stop recording after around 22 min, and at best recording times are limited to less than 30min.  Unlike my FT1, you can't set this camera up to record an event without a minder - it's ok for clips, but that's it.  Battery life for taking video is around 82 minutes.  (Also, video ISO is limited to 1600.)
