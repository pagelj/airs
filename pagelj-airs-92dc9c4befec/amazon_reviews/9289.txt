Great starter Camera.
After using a Kodak Advantix film camera for a long while I finally moved over to trying out a digital camera for the first time and this was my first one. Right out of the box it was easy to set up and familiarize myself with the menus and settings. What I liked about it the most was the 14 MP screen which made it easy for me to take photos outside or indoors since I did not want to have to squint to see a small MP screen. Pros: Small for portability, great indoor or outdoor shots, settings to fit the shooting situation. I am impressed with the quality of Olympus and would definitely recommend one to a friend that wants a simple point and shoot camera.
