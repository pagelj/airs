NOT A SLIM LED!  No picture of it from the side, why????
There is a big difference with this TV from one I bought last year! I went in to my orders, pulled up the order of the TV I bought from Amazon in December 2011, when I clicked on it, it stated that the item was unavailable and that there was a newer version of it, and it directed me right to this TV.  So I thought that I was getting a really great deal. I placed the order for this TV for my Grandfather in Florida.  I just saw a picture of it today and it is NOT A SLIM design like I wanted! It appears to me that there is NO SIDE VIEW PICTURE OF THIS so you think you are getting a great deal for the TV because of the price.  I did not think I was going to have to go all the way down and read the big Samsung model chart with the options since I was directed right to this TV as the newer model, so why would it be so different???  Buyer beware is all I have to say, so, if you think you are getting a SLIM LED, you most certainly are NOT!  Read all the details, I did not, I just assumed it would be slim since it was supposedly the new and improved model of the TV I already own.  I am just so upset about it tonight.  Really, really seemed to be a photo left out on purpose for people like me that did not know that any LED TV had become so much thicker.  Yes, it may be light according to my brother, but it is the principle of the matter to me. Not happy...  and it takes a lot to make me unhappy about anything as you can tell from my many reviews over the years.
