Good versatile FX lens
You may hear a lot of photographers putting this lens down.  I <<will>> say this is NOT the equivalent of the 18-200 lens for the DX series (that lens is just phenom)..... BUT... this is a great versatile lens, and it's on my D800 99% of the time.  LR takes care of virtually ALL of the "putdown issues" with auto lens correction... and the end result are images that are incredible rich and sharp.  A good workhorse lens for those needing more versatility than being a fashion photographer (which is pretty much everyone else, methinks).  :-)
