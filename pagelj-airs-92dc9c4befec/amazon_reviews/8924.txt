Sony Children's Headphones
Our 5 year old granddaughter had a Justice headset and some other one and the quality was just unacceptable - I bought this set because it was Sony - I felt the others were really just toys and this was truly audio equipment - for the price you can't beat the sound quality - and she loved that they were Pink.  Loves it with her iTouch.
