Is anyone else's distorted?
I can't tell if it's the camera or the monitor, but our picture is very distorted. It looks like I'm looking through night vision goggles. All I see are heat waves, and no clear picture. I know it's an issue because when we first got it and plugged it in the picture was crystal clear. Now, less than 2 weeks later, I can't seem to get our picture back. Thought maybe it's placement near a heat source was the problem but when I moved it nothing changed. In the process of getting a refund. I really really like this monitor when I can see my baby clearly, but lately that has been few and far between. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Or did I just get a lemon?
