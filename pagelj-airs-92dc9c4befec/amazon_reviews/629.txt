This camera worked great in the water and out.  The pictures were only grainy when zoomed in all the way, but overall the pictures were good.  This camera was perfect for snorkeling and boating.  I got great underwater shots.  Extremely easy to use as well.  For a 7 day trip I only changed the batteries twice.  It took a beating on some rocks without breaking.  Most important of all it did not leak water into it and break like most of the other cameras available.
