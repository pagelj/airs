Great Resource
I purchased both this book and the second volume. I can best describe the value of Kelby's books by telling you the following story. I thought I was lending these books to a good friend who's a very highly experienced and gifted professional photographer. After a couple of days he called me and told me how much he liked the books and that it was so nice of me to let him have them! Guess I'm buying them again. Both of us really like Kelby's sense of humor - reminds us of our own conversations. I found the Photoshop sharpening techniques he describes to be superior to all the ways I've tried. Just this one little trick more than paid for the book. Kelby's photos alone make the books a worthwile purchase. I would highly recommend these books as required reading for anyone starting out. They'll most certainly be useful for experienced photographers as well.
