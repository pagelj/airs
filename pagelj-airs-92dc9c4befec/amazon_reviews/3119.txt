I did a lot of research before purchasing this machine.  This will not replace your vacuum cleaner, but serves as a quick easy clean up machine for small messes.  I wanted something to help with stairs instead of lugging our big machine up the stairs one at a time to vacuum.  It serves it's purpose.  I also wanted something in the sense of a motorized "dust pan" for small messes--crumbs from the kids, etc.  It works great!! I thought this detached and acted as a "dust buster" as well, but I was wrong (read so much about so many different ones, I most likley got confused).  But it is so lightweight and small and you can use it just about everywhere.  I would like something with a little more pin-point action, but it's not advertised as such so it's not the machine's fault. My only real complaint is the battery/power life.  Now, it does come with a second battery which is helpfull but they do not last all that long.  As I mentioned above, it does what I wanted it to do.  It's great for stairs, small messes and cleaning up a small room.  Don't expect to replace your normal vacuum with it.
