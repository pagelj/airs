Doesn't fit, waste of money
I should have read the reviews! Everytime I buy a cheap version of the iPhone adapter, it goes right in the garbage, usually because they stop working after a short while. This time, the dang plug didn't even fit into the phone! Complete waste of money!!! Because I only spent a couple bucks and it took so long to get here, it's not even worth sending back (which I'm sure is their goal - send a crappy, cheaply made product from a foreign country and hope the customer doesn't want to waste their time sending it back = instant profit.) SCAM! Amazon should have better standards - if a product doesn't meet quality standards, they should remove it from their offerings so their customers aren't cheated. It makes them look just as bad.
