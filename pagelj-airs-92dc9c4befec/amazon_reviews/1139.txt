great replacement, more sturdy than the original
The original cable was flimsy and broke recently. The whole head attachment just detached from the plastic part. So far it has lasted 3 years almost so I figured it was time to replace it. This part is actually of better quality than the original part and works like a a charm. Not disappointed at all of buying it since the replacement cable from the manufacturer is twice as expensive.
