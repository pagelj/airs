Love this Toast / egg poaching machine!
I laughed when my wife gave me this as a gift.  I told her it would run the typical cycle of kitchen > pantry >  basement > goodwill.  I was certain it couldn't possibly make a decent poached egg.  I actually wanted her to just send it back as a return.  She asked me to read the reviews and give it a chance. I must say it makes PERFECT poached eggs EVERY time.  If it disappeared or stopped working I'd order a new one the same day.  Very easy to use and actually does everything they claim.  It even keeps your toast or muffin warm until the poached egg is ready. I sometime toast big slices of rye bread.  The toaster slot depth is really designed more for a smaller depth item like english muffins or bagels.  No problem really, I just cut large slices of bread in half and the toaster does a fine job.  If I could make one change it would be deeper slots to accommodate larger bread types... but with that said, still a remarkable product. I have used the boiled egg function a couple of times to make hard boiled eggs.  It will make up to eight perfect hard boiled eggs quick and easy.  Just follow the directions and put the correct amount of water in and it times it's self.  It cooks using steam and turns it's self off when the eggs are ready. I've seen a few reviews that complain about clean up and I have no idea what they'er doing wrong.  Very easy clean up.  I use a little spray non stick oil (like "Pam" spray) in the poaching trays and NOTHING sticks.  Takes a few seconds to clean up up after each use.
