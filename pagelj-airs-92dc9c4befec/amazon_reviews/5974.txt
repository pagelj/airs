Great Cable
Not much to say here, this is a great cable. I got a more expensive one from Walmart when I first bought my TV because I did not want to wait to order one off of Amazon and then have to wait for it to ship to me. This cable here is half the price and double the length! For a long time I was wishing that my first cable wasn't only 3 feet long. Sometimes with the other cable that I have, it takes a while before the signal is detected but with this one, it's almost instantaneous. I really like this cable and would definitely buy a second!
