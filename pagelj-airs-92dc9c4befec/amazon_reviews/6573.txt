I've had this for about a month now.  I replaced a heavy Hoover upright that never worked right.  If you're looking for a small, lightweight, yet powerful vacuum, this is it.  It does make my rugs look great and it's amazing how much dirt gets sucked up in minutes.  I can vacuum places in my small condo that I couldn't reach before with my bigger clunker.  A couple drawbacks are - the size of the compartment that holds the dirt is quite small although it is very easy to empty.  The cord isn't retractable either and that would have been great.  The wand sits in the vacuum while not in use and dust collects quickly around the air holes which you must wipe off before using - BUT it's great to have it so handy.  Those few negatives don't detract from all the positives - I'd recommend this vacuum.
