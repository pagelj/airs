Older than my old battery
I ordered a new battery but when I received it, I found that this battery is older than my old battery. It discharges very fast, less than an hour, even after fully charged. The manufacturing date is 07/01/2011, which is older than my old battery, which was manufactured on 08/09/2011. This battery is almost at the end of its life.
