Great backpack, poorly constructed shoulder straps
Have had this backpack for about a year now and everything has been awesome about it except for the shoulder straps which have started to tear in places.  I give four stars because the backpack is still fully functional and has been perfect for my needs (student carrying lots of books and a computer everyday).  The tears so far have been on the not-so-important parts of the shoulder straps like the reflective bands and the sunglasses holder - so merely cosmetic at this point.  This being said, for a company like Swiss Army I expect much better construction and I feel that it is only a matter of time before the strap fully rips away from the top of the backpack.  I don't understand why they decided to attach the top strap with enough nylon to hold up a truck, but then skimped out on the shoulder straps.... dumb!
