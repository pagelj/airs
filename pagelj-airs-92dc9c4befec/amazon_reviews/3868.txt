A light, entertaining romance
Actually, Marriage by Mistake was two romance stories for the price of FREE. I don't normally choose light romance as reading materiel, but I do love to find out about new writers through a free read. So - that being said, I'm probably not the target audience. And yet, I enjoyed this book so much that the number of 1 and 2 star reviews here on Amazon actually surprises me. Yes, the initial set-up requires some suspension of belief - that Kelly and Dean met, fell in love, and got married all in two days in Las Vegas while Dean was under hypnotic influence. Once I bought in to that, the rest was easy. The secondary romance was a pleasant surprise. In fact, I was delighted that the female antagonist, a self-proclaimed Ice Queen who had hoped to marry Dean - went completely off stereotype and wasn't nasty to the female protagonist. Talk about refreshing. Very nice. I think readers of light, comic romance would enjoy this story.
