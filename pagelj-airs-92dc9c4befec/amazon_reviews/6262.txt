My 20 year old GE under cabinet coffee maker gave up the spirit and my wife has been wanting to try a Keurig.  Not me, I grind my frozen beans and immediately brew a pot.  Besides, that K-cup stuff gets pricey compared to buying whole beans.  So, this rig seemed to strike a good balance. After owning it for a month, I remain quite pleased with this model.  My wife gets to have her Senseo flavors while I enjoy the traditional method.  While I won't critique the Senseo flavors, they are far "greener" than the plastic K-cups. (I have I mentioned how much I hate plastic water bottles strewn everywhere?)  The Senseo pods easily disappear with a flick of the in-sink waste disposal. The travel mug is OK, I suppose, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice for travel since it uses an O-ring lid compression seal instead of a screw on lid.  The Senseo side of the coffemaker also allows for ground coffee or drop some instant coffee (yuk), cocoa or tea bag. There is a water sight indicator on the carafe side just in case you need to remember if water was previously added. The only possible negative is the clock/timer setting in that it is easy to accidentally change the hours or minutes while handling the unit.  The clock has no lock feature.  No biggie, really. If anyone seeks a dual purpose coffeemaker, this Hamilton-Beach product is just the ticket.
