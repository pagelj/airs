VERY HAPPY WITH DESIGN: Easy Install, Does What It Should
I bought this despite the other reviews because I liked that I could mount my 9" Sony that has a swivel screen like a flat screen. This saves me space over the laptop like cases. With my portable DVD player EVERY BUTTON IS ACCESSIBLE so it is super user-friendly. I was a little concerned changing the DVD would be a pain because you have to take the DVD player out of the mount to get the DVD out but when I tried it it took me maybe a minute to get out and put back in once I figured it out. Also, I'm installation challenged and I got this assembled in just a few minutes!!! That has never happened before. It fits my Honda EX Odyssey perfectly. I've only test driven it around the block but sound was good and from what I could observe from the driver's seat shaking was minimal. I figure it is for the kid's anyway so a perfectly still picture isn't all that important to me. Finally, the only negative comment I have is that my van does not have an auxiliary input so I can't use the included cable to hook sound up to the van's speakers. This was a big plus when I bought this, but it isn't the mounts fault that my van doesn't have this feature! Just an FYI, if that is important to you check your car's user manual first. All that to say I'm glad I ignored all the bad reviews and tried it. I'm really happy with this design and probably would pay more than $15 if I had to.
