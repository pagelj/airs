SO-SO!
I GAVE THIS LENS THREE STARS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S EXTREMELY LOUD!!!! IT'S FINE WHILE TAKING PICTURES OF IMAGES EVEN PEOPLE FOR THAT MATTER, BUT JUST PICTURES!!! I SHOOT MUSIC VIDEOS/INTERVIEWS AND YOU CAN HEAR THIS LENS THE ENTIRE TIME!!!! IT IS WAYS AROUND IT LIKE SPEAKING LOUDER THEN NORMAL OR EDITING IT WITH A GOOD SOUND MIXER BUT IT WILL BE MORE WORK THEN YOU WOULD ALREADY BE DOING. I PAID $249.00 DOLLARS FOR THIS LENS AND AMAZON SOLD IT ONE DAY LATER FOR $199.00 DOLLARS, I WISH I WOULD HAVE WAITED! BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME GOOD QUALITIES AS WELL, IT HAS REALLY SHARP IMAGES, THE IS WORKS RATHER WELL, AND THE FOCUS IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THE PRICE!!! IF YOU ARE MORE OF A PHOTOGRAPHER THEN VIDEOGRAPHER THEN IT WOULD BE AN AFFORDABLE LENS TO START YOU OFF!!!!:-) SN: IT WAS FREE (3-5 DAYS SHIPPING) AND IT CAME EARLY! HOPE THIS HELPS!!!
