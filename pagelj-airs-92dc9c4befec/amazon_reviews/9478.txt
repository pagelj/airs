It's an HDMI cable..
It is an HDMI cable. It does exactly what an HDMI cable is supposed to do, for a FRACTION of the price of what big box retail/electronic stores charge (Why do these things have such a markup?). Anyway, it's awesome. I now know where to buy any HDMI cables I will need in the future. Currently using this one to go from the back of my 670 GTX to my monitor. The cable is thick and heavy duty. Pretty good stuff.
