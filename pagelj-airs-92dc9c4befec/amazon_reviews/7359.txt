Useful information for newbies - condescending style
Kelby's book has useful information for those just beginning to explore Single Lens Reflex (SLR) photography - though targeted at Digital SLR (DSLR) users, it has useful information for all. The style of writing is rather condescending - the sense of humor makes fun of the target audience - those who picked up this book to learn the basics. Pluses1)  Useful information, accessible to those learning basics of photography2)  Easy to follow, details on how to make photographs in certain stylesDeltas1) Condescending style of writing2) Makes fun of the target audience itself3) Repetitive
