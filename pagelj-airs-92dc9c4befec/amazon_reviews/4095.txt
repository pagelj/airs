Thought I could trust Nikon and Amazon
I purchased the camera from Ritz Camera through Amazon and the camera did not work once.  I put the batteries in and got nothing.  I put different, new batteries in and got nothing.  I went to Amazon's website to try to exchange the item and got kicked off to RItz Camera.  The Ritz site did not have  instructions so I called the "contact us" number and got representative that did not speak english as a first language.  I am not sure what he said.  Needless to say, I still have nothing.  No exchange, no return authorization; just a promise to look into it and get back to me by email.  This sucks...
