newest technology "pays off" in more ways than one!
This highly rated cordless phone (by a nationally accredited rating organization)did not fail to impress. A superior amount of advanced features, easy programing & great pick-up & transmission of handset 'speaker-phone' makes it a SUPER BUY"! The only down-side that I can relate is that I could not find how to select the same ring-tone for the base station that I selected for the hand sets.
