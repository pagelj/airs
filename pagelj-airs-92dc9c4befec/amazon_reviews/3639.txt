Pure junk, except it takes really sharp pictures
Sharp and cheap.  If you only have the 18-55 kit lens, this is definitely your next lens unless you can throw down a lot more cash. Pros:Once you get to about f/2.8 this thing gets pretty darned sharp.  The sweet-spot seems to be around f/4.0 to f/4.5 on my XTi which is where it is sharpest. No noticeable chromatic aberration.  Of course being a prime, we all should hope so. Cons:Everything else that makes a lens a lens is what this fails at. It's hopelessly soft wide open.  The bokeh is nasty looking.  Color saturation isn't so hot.  It gets softer towards the edges.  In low light, auto-focus will "hunt" far more often than it should.  I can deal with all those issues.  What really makes this a bad lens is the auto-focus miss issue. Focus will too often land just in front of your subject meaning that you're going to just toss the picture in the trash.  Given that it tempts you to use a thin depth of focus, this will happen a lot.  If you can get a good in-focus shot then all the other issues will melt away and you'll be in awe of what a great shot you can get from this thing given the number of dollars this item commands.
