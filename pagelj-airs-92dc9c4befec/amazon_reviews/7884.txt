Fixed what was wrong with the last model.
Love this recorder and I am always amazed at the quality. I don't use 1/3 of what this this can do, multi track and such, but as a field recorder it's great. The dual jacks (XLR & 1/4) are a great way to save space and save having to take adapters along. The body is a big upgrade from the H4, the menus are better. Overall quality is way way up. It now feels like a $300 tool.
