Great book, but women grunts? No.
I love this book, it's very well-written.  But I'm enjoying it because it's sci-fi and pure fantasy. Women "combat grunts"?  Lol... absurd.  Reality is far different.  I can see where Obama gets his ideas.  And the reason "the military" agreed with accepting women into infantry units, is because not a single Army general on the JCS is an infantry officer.  Just fat POGs wearing those p*ssy CABs. I spent 15 years as an infantryman with the US Army, btw.
