Travel Purse
I love the purse -- living out of country so is perfect for using when out and about and like a color that doesn't attract attention.  I have plenty of room for my wallet, reading glasses and sun glasses cases and more.  I like all the pockets, the material, and the side pocket for the iPod and a water bottle.  Received quickly too.
