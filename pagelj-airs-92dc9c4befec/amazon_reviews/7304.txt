Dora Backpack
I was very pleased that the item was delivered 2 days earlier than expected. Overall, the backpack is very nice. My only semi-complaint is that in the picture it shows that the backpack's eyes, mouth, etc. are embroidered into the backpack. But instead, the facial features were made out of a plastic material and sewn in. I still would have ordered it regardless, but just wanted to mention it to those who care, that you may not be getting the embroidered stitching if that matters to you. I'm still very happy with the seller and purchase. And I would definitely order again from this seller. 2 Thumb's up!
