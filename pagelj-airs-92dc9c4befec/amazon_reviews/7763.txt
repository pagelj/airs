good but what the ???
We bought this for our 6 yr old who loves to sing. The 300 songs are old time gospel songs, and kids rimes that are quite old. There is also a few Christmas songs with verses that I have never heard. While the Karaoke machine is good I would suggest purchasing a disk with more current music or your kid like ours might be bored with the songs he has never heard before...
