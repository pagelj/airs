Fooled by "Wi-Fi Ready"
I did not know that "Wi-Fi Ready" is code for needing to connect with an Ethernet cable OR buy an adapter that costs about the same as the blue-ray player.  LG needs to make the meaning of "Wi-Fi Ready" clear to purchasers.  It seems to be fine as a DVD player, but I wanted the ability to connect to the internet easily.  Purchased at Amazon but did not discover this issue until it was too late to return it.
