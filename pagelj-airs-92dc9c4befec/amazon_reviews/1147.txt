Installs easily, does protect but affects clarity in trade-off for anti-glare properties
I'm glad we got this because my child DOES use the Kindle Fire outside but he is complaining that he needs to put on his fairly mild near-sighted reading glasses when he uses it with the screen on.  That's because you trade some of the Kindle screen's Clarity for the anti-glare qualities.  However, once I showed him how he could take the anti-glare  iVisor on and off, he got used to it and only puts it on when he needs the Anti-Glare feature.  He had been leaving it on all the time.  This is a decent enough product but frankly, I feel it should be in the $12 range.  $19.99 is a bit steep for something you have to keep popping on and off.  In fact, I'd rather see a sleeve like antiglare device that is mostly open on the back but fits the Kindle fire more like a glove so it is easier to slid on and off. Even given my dislikes, I'm still happy with this accessory.  It was very easy to install and it is simply to remove and then put back on.  It meets a need we have so I'm happy with it.  There's not much more to say because it is a simple accessory that does what it says and doesn't cost very much to do it.  It's not a luxury item but rather a convenience item and I'm glad we have it even though it doesn't do everything a person might want in a screen or protective sleeve.  For the price, it IS worth buying but I still think they should come down just a bit to the $12 price point or at least reconfiguer it into a sleeve device.  It is an improvement over a cheaper no-name brand we bought at a local electronics store so I am pleased enough to give it 4 stars.
