smart toaster
this is a nice toaster but has some fail type occurences....... gets stuck at times and won't eject the toast and open up unless you unplug it and wait till it goes back to default on its own..... don't feel like sending it back.... too much trouble...... hard to get in contact with someone from breville.... did once but lost the phone number.... generally okay machine.... costly......
