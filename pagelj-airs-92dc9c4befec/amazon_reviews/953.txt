Loving Ode to an Era
I haven't looked up Ernest Cline yet. I am almost afraid to. I would be willing to be my last dollar that he is a white, 40-something college-educated male. If he's not, then Mr. Cline is frighteningly talented since he would then be performing a pitch perfect imitation. If you are a man of a certain age (early to mid-40s), this book will likely give you provide you with a nostalgic smile on almost every page. The plot, such as it is (it's not the book's strong point - neither are the characters), is a delivery mechanism for myriad '80s pop culture references, delivered with love and reverence for the source material. Highly recommended, especially if you are among the target demographic cohort.
