Toaster doesn't toast
How hard can it be?? It seems like ever 1-2 years we have to get a new toaster oven. It is the work horse of our kitchen and family. We've tried the expensive ones, we've tried the less expensive ones... they all break or die after a year or so. Not this one. It lasted 2 MINUTES. Knobs wouldn't turn, and after 10 minutes it only slightly toasted one side of a piece of bread. We cleaned out the three crumbs, boxed it back up, and pulled out the old one. ( Another Black & Decker, 20 months old with a wacky door, and two broken knobs-- we use needle nose pliers to turn it on.) Sigh. I just want a toaster oven that lasts longer than a manicure.
