Great little inverter
This is a fantastic inverter, it has an on/off switch so I can just leave it plugged into the cigarette outlet all the time.  My one complaint is the fan noise. It has a fan that runs when the inverter is on and it's at just the right frequency where it becomes annoying after about 5 minutes, I did find that if I sheltered it the noise wasn't as unbearable.
