It is indeed Nifty
Ok so basically i call this a disciplinary lens , since it is a fixed lens it definitely teaches you to zoom with your feet and forces you to experiment with range. Although it is a low light lens , DO NOT be disappointed when the auto focus creeps. The AF sucks. I rarely use AF on any lens always MF. The depth of field is really strong so its great for portrait photos. The casing is made of plastic but I haven't had any problems with it. I personally love the lens. ( i find that you either love it or hate it . . . although i think if you hate you don't know how to use it )
