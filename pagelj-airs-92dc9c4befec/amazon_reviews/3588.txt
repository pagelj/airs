The only USB charger you will ever need
This is not only a dual port charger which is very handy in itself. The additional plus is that one port is very capable of charging an IPad and the other port can be used for smaller devices such as a phone. The overall size of the charger is good and the blue power light is very helpful clearly indicating power is available. Many times in airports some of the outlets are not active so this eliminates the guess work. When charging an iPad the charger is very warm but not excessive.
