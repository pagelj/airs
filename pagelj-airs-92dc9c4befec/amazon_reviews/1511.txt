Maybe I have a defective one but the toasting is not consistent at all.  I toast the same bread on the same number and it never is the same sometimes only one side toasts and other times its very dark or very light using the number two. I finally decided to comment because yesterday I toasted my last two pieces of bread on two and they were so dark I could not eat them so they went out to the birds. Not too happy about this product.
