I was looking for a  something light and cordless vacume. This delivers and more. It has good suction power for bare floor and carpet. I really hated vacuming before mostly handling heavy vacume and plugging on and off but no more of that. I can just put away in corner of a closet as it is so small. Buy and use it you will love it.
