Fm radio requires use of a headphone
I was dissappointed  in the cell phone as the FM radio feature requires the use of a Nokia headphone. Some cell phones of Nokia's competitors do not require the use of headphones. Amazon website did not state that the FM radio feature required the use of headphone, so I had assumed that it did not.  I did not return the item to  Amazon because i had already left for overseas when I realized that a headphone would be required. Amazon/Nokia should not omit such detailsfromtheir product description.
