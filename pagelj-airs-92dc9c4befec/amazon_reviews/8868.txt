iPhone 5 Adaptor
GREAT product, if not using a phone case. In order to use it I have to take my phone case off due to the bulkiness of the charger spot. Kind of a pain in the rear, but considering the price and the fact I still have 15 iPhone 4 chargers and didn't want to buy another 5 charger, this is a good investment.
