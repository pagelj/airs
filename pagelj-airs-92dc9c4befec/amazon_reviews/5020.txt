Worked well then failed just like others have posted
We ordered the LG BD670 after reading the glowing reviews about the great video quality and the ability to bring streaming video to our home.  Now after 4 months of light use the player will no longer load disks. Just as others have reported the player makes a loud grinding noise when trying to load a disk.  Also, the same as other reviewers, we have problems with it loosing the wireless settings.  Also, had to reset the player several times after it would no longer load our Netflix account. I could have lived with the occasional resets but it is pretty much dead for loading disks.  The warranty on labor is not long enough as it should match the warranty on parts (1 year). Since there are multiple buyers reporting the same disk loading issue this is an obvious flaw and I wouldn't recommend this player to anyone.  Look at the most recent reviews to get the true user experience. The other features and the video quality are good but look elsewhere as there are lots of similar priced players in this segment.
