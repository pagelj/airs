Why go to a Store??????
This isn't the first probuct I've purchased from Mediabridge. Thier products are just as good if not better than anything you can buy at your local "Electronics Store" and they sell at a fraction of store prices. The same quality construction, the same gold plating, as a matter of fact the HDMI cables from Mediabridge, I feel are tougher than a cable I had bought at a store two years ago. The thing that gets me is ,you know how when a product first comes on the market it's priced on the high side then as time goes by prices start to come down? So why is it cables and electronics peripherals stay high priced in "stores"? Mediabridge through Amazon is the only way to go!!!!
