After 2 years, our B&D 480BS had its last gasp... shame because 2 years isn't enough time. The dial knobs got too hot and fused up, leaving it useless other than a paperweight. I can't remember the toaster over we had prior to this one, but we owned it forever and abused it daily. Not going to buy this brand again. Hope this helps you.
