Screen bubbles very aggravating!!
This case got nothing but good reviews, so I didn't hesitate to purchase one for my husband's new iPhone 4. Be sure you order it from a seller who indicates "retail packaging" in the description. I received mine & it wasn't in a box. There were no instructions on how to install it. As I've never had one before, I couldn't even figure out how to get it apart!  I googled it & there are many videos out there demonstrating installation. The built-in screen protector gave me fits! I could NOT get the bubbles/watermarks to disappear! After googling & watching many videos, I installed an HD anti-glare screen protector on the iPhone screen. This appears to have corrected the issue. None of my friends have had this problem... but after googling the issue, it is apparently a problem for others too. Otterbox apparently tells people to put baby powder on the screen??? I did NOT want to do that. Not sure why we had this problem, but it was aggravating to say the least! Since we just got the case yesterday & finally got the bubbles to go away today, I cannot say how the case will hold up. I'm contemplating returning it & ordering the newer version which seems to be sturdier where the flaps are. Time will tell...
