Great Value
I bought two of these after the factory headphones for my Chrysler Town and Country broke.  I just put the batteries in and the blue tooth worked great with no hassle.  I can't comment on the sound quality or even the comfortability of them because they are for my kids.  They have not seemed to mind them at all. I was impressed by the quality of them for the price they are at.  I fully expect my kids to break them at some point because that is what they do but they should withstand quite a bit of abuse. I am guessing the majority of purchasers will be getting these for your kids.  So I would overwhelmingly recommend them to those people. UPDATE:Just replaced the batteries in them a couple weeks ago so the battery life was pretty good.  Lasted about 2.5 months or so with pretty regular use.  I think my kids leave them on when we get out so the auto off seems to work well.  My youngest just turned three and he can turn these on and off easily and he knows how to adjust the volume on them so I guess they are easy to use.  I think the fact that they fold up helps them take more abuse than other headphones.  So I stand by the 5 star review and would absolutely recommend these over the more expensive ones if they are just for your kids.
