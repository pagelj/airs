Just what I was looking for!!
The original toaster I got as an anniversary present 36 years ago was still working fine when I gave it to my brother after using it for 20 years! BIG MISTAKE!! I have searched for a good toaster for the last 15-16 years. Every time I would get one it would work great for awhile and then gradually need to be turned higher and higher to achieve a decently toasted piece of bread. This toaster is perfect every time and I have had it for 6+ months. Toast, bagel or homemade bread is wonderful! I love to toast my homemade banana bread in it. The lift and check feature is nice too, I use it more than I thought I would. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is pricey. But I am old enough to remember all my mother's 1950s appliances that lasted forever and was willing to pay for something that would last. I don't want to have to go shopping every few years to replace things as seems to be the case nowadays........ If you don't mind the hefty price, buy this toaster!!
