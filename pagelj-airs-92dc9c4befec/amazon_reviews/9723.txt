very slow for a toaster
Ii bought this at a different company for $50, so $100 seems high. However, I don't think it is worth $50.  It looks good for the price, but it takes forever to heat up. My old Black and Decker heater which just died would heat the elements to orange hot in about 45 seconds. This one took about 140 seconds ... almost 2.5 minutes before it even starts toasting bread. Maybe as a small oven for baking it might be ok, but not for toasting bread.
