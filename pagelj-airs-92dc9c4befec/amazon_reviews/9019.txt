It's defective!
I got this camera, and it seems well manufactured but after trying to get it going, I won't exit the "Mass Storage" menu. It does work with the internal battery, but for less than forty minutes then I had to recharge. The quality of the video is fine, but,  I searched online and apparently some do malfunction. I'm returning it, but Amazon won't replace it, it will only make a refund which I hope is without restocking fees! I really can't see why they won't replace it...
