Disapointed
I did read the reviews on this bag but took a chance any way. Should have paid closer attention to the negatives. Just received this bag which I was going to give as a gift for my mom. Figured I would inspect it first before I was confident in giving it to her. I was sorely disappointed. First impression was this bag looks cheap. This is not good imitation leather by any stretch. I looks fake, feels fake. Second the odd fishy smell is absolutely accurate. Also the color in the picture is not true either. The picture feels like it would be a richer tone. It is much more pale in color that what the picture represents and part of what makes it look cheap. I will be returning it as I do not feel good about giving this item as a gift.
