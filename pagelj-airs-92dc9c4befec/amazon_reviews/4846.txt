Love the look but not the toaster
I had high hopes for this toaster.  I looked forever hoping to find a red toaster to match my kitchenaid blender.  I finally settled on this one.  I dont love that it is metallic but the red is pretty.  I do wish it were more of a flat red though.  The toaster works but after the first round of toast, the second round always comes out burnt on one side and not on the other.... not the best toaster but if you want a red one, its pretty.
