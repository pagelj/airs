A slam dunk winner
I had to give this a 5 star. i bought it for my six year old grand daughter's birthday. It was worth every penny, she absolutely loves it. I was worried because I saw it had some mixed review's but it takes great pictures indoors and out and the special features are fun and easy for her to operate. I'm afraid she basically ignored all her other gifts after she saw this camera. A great product hands down. Never seen her so delighted discovering what she could do with it.
