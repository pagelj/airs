Great service... all my worries were for nothing
My camera is one of the most important items in my life.  I don't just take photos of trips and families, I'll take specific trips just to take photos.  So when my camera broke, I was pretty upset and worried.  I bought the Square Trade warranty but didn't expect to have to mail my camera off.  I figured it would stay in Richmond.  Every thing took about two weeks, from shipping it off, to finding out out that it couldn't be fixed, to getting back a refund check for the original price of my camera, and getting parts sent back to me promptly when they realized I sent extra parts to verify my camera worked.  I couldn't have been more thrilled.  I was sad my camera couldn't be fixed, but knowing I was getting a quick refund help me buy the replacement camera.  And, I bought a new Square Trade warranty, just in case. Great company.  Easy to work with, easy to get results.  I don't work for this company or have any affiliation.  Just a happy customer.
