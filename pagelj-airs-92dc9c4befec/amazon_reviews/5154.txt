At twenty his star ship the Araidne  was all, beyond himself  that  he was comfortable being responsible for. Charting a  course for Megiddo station orbiting Delta Oriana he had only one thing on his mind, to make a profitable trade. The moment he stepped onto Megiddo station he knew something was wrong. When he arrived at the station masters office he knew he was in real trouble.  The trouble came in the form of the  Station Master's  five daughters,  he had no choice  but he had to choose, so he chose the oldest. Now the story begins!
