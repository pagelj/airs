Excellent smart phone
This is my 1st smartphone & like it very much. Good battery life. Very lightweight. Looks sleek and appealing. V fast wi-fi. GPS is amazing. I did not give 5 stars due to:- T-Mobile does not support 3G or 4G on this device. They say, they use 1700/2100, that this phone doesn't support.- Phone slows down at times. Otherwise this is the best I could get for around $240
