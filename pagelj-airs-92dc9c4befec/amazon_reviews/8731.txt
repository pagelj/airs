Great start for Samsung. Now, here's what could be better.
I've owned this Samsung model for a couple of months now, and it has slowly worked its way into becoming my primary machine for most daily tasks. Much like a Mac/OSX environment, any given Chromebook is just plain going to work. ChromeOS has its limitations -- covered in these reviews and elsewhere -- but for what Chromebooks are, in terms of a very basic productivity/web browsing experience, this Samsung Chromebook does a very admirable job at a very respectable price. For the rest of this review, I simply wish to focus on one thing: what keeps this from being a 5-star machine?* SCREEN: While more than adequate for the given resolution, we live in an era where screens on laptops count a great deal. Apple gets this, but other manufacturers just aren't there yet. Granted, mediocre displays keep cost down, which was a primary factor for Samsung in creating this Chromebook. Still, we need higher resolution and a greater pixel density in this Samsung line before we can call this size-factor truly .* RAM & PROCESSOR: Though I've not seen it benchmarked, I'd predict that the ARM is fantastic here. The problem is that these machines simply do not carry enough RAM, and this has an overall affect on page rendering times. Even basic extensions, like the new Google Hangouts, are unwieldy and run with slight delay. When Samsung can fix these two factors and give us just slightly better hardware in a future model, this machine will become an indispensable one in the lives of geeks and regular users alike. Until then, one still can't go wrong with this system as a secondary or tertiary computing device for content consumption AND creation. That said, I would rank its utility above most tablets at this current time.
