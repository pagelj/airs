Too slippery, very poor manual, VERY annoying software
I'll be brief:(1) No camera this small should be this slippery; it is simply too easy to drop.(2) The lanyard is missing a slider to snug it up around the wrist.(3) Plugging its USB cable into a computer unleashes a torrent of Sony windows popping up, all but one of which are irrelevant to downloading photos the most direct way possible, which is NOT through Sony's PlayMemories Home software.(4) The DSC-WX150 manual (printed and in-camera) is incomplete and utterly exasperating.(5) There's no manual focus, and the auto-focus is pathetic on close (< 1 foot) objects.
