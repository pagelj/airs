Amazing, But Will Make People Edge Away From You When Talking About It
At first I was a bit skeptical to read this book.  But it came with a lot of recommendations, so I dove right in.  Since it was the first sci-fi book I had ever read, the beginning was tough to swallow.  I admit that once the author started to describe these "tree ships", I wanted to stop reading.  I'm glad I kept at it, because the book turned out to be fantastic.  After completing this book, I devoured the final 3 books of the series, eager to learn more about the fascinating universe that Mr. Simmons had created. Admittedly, this is the strongest book of the 4.  The characters, plot, language, element of mystery, and diversity of technology make it feel very fresh and exciting.  Dan Simmons does an excellent job of sucking you into this universe, so much so that when you're gibbering on about the book to a friend or colleague, the way in which you will describe the story may invite some strange looks and cause some people to edge away from you slowly with a nervous smile on their face. I recommend this book (and series) to anyone who will listen.  It is my go-to answer for the question "Do you have any good book recommendations?", because I know most people have not read it. In short, do yourself a favor and read this book.
