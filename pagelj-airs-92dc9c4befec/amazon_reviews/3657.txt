Easy to use
I have had this Sony Disc Player only a short time but find that it was easy to hook up and use. I purchased a short HDMI cable and connected the unit to my TV and it was ready to use. The remote works well and the play quality of the unit is very good. This is my first Blu-ray player and the picture quality of the Blu-ray DVD is amazing. I have not used the Wi-Fi feature and probably won't until or if we get faster internet service here. The size of the player is very compact and it looks very stylish. I read some complaints in the product reviews related to the small size of the operating buttons, their black color and location, but I find them easy to use where I have the player located. If you have vision problems they could be an issue. I did stop a movie at mid-point and shut off the player. Later, when I wanted to finish watching the movie, it started from the beginning and not where I had stopped watching it. I had to fast forward to the point where I had left off. There may be a way I can find the stopping point but I have not had time to study the manual closely yet.
