Sometimes you find an album that makes you cry
This was one of them.  There are elements of this album that are empowering and there are elements that can make you feel that your life is small and fragile. It's flat out beautiful, it's not the same sound as I Brought You My Bullets but it's the same raw emotion, just evolved and that's a wonderful thing for those of us that have been fans since they've played VFW's in New Jersey.
