30 Days - 6 Times Calling Customer Service
Considering that this laptop was just released in October and considering I have it for a bit over a month now, I am shocked that I had to call Toshiba Support 6 times in 32 days. More so, I paid an extra fee of $159 to have them be on call for any PC issues that may come up. What was my issue? At first, the VLC wouldn't play but then the downloads just wouldn't downloads. Now mind you, I am downloading very typical stuff that most PCs have. And yet, I can't open them UNLESS I restart my computer which is ridiculous as I have to do it often. Now, the support team are kind and spend time helping, about 2 hours each time but time is money and it is annoying that something so new -  have so many issues. Heck, I have a desktop that's over a DECADE old and I NEVER had any issues with it. Maybe it is Windows 8's fault. Maybe it is Toshiba. But I am on the verge of a refund shortly. On the good side, the computer itself is fast. Does what it needs (when downloads are not involved). Screen is OK (need to find the right angle). But overall -  it is good. My issue is what's happening to me personally. Toshiba Care mentioned that they will exchange it with a brand new laptop if this continues (which it is) and let's see if they follow up on that.
