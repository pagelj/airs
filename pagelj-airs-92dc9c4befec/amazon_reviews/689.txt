Very very good in-ear headphone and the price is great too.
It comes with not so eyes catchy packaging. When I opened the box, the cable and the audio jack does not impress me much but that is what I am expecting for a 7 bucks headphone. However when I plug-in my Phone to listen to a song, I am so impressed with the sound especially the bass. Somebody might say the bass is a bit too heavy but I just like it. It is comparable to those $30-$40 bucks headphones that I bought. I will see how long it can last.
