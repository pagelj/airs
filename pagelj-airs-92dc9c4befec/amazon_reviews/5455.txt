Very Nice Science Fiction Tale
I judge my science fiction on a modified version of the Baen criteria: the scientific advances / future technology needs to be somewhat believable, if there are aliens they need to be presented in some realistic format with names I can pronounce in my head while I read, and must have some type of plot with circumstances - good or bad - with their resolution I can get my head around, believe, and be interested in turning to the next page to learn more; that's quite a mouthful, but we've all read a lot of bad science fiction over the years. With all that being said, this book hits it on all fronts - I literally had a hard time putting this down while on an out of town trip, and became impatient when the stewardess announced all Kindles ahd to be turned off lest my Kindle somehow crash the 737.  The author does a great job of explaining in somewhat layman's terms the gadgets and technological advances, the dialogue between the characters is to the point without a lot of fluff, and I found myself daydreaming a couple of times about the spacecraft and technology and what  I would like to do if that was available now. As I type this review, the Kindle version is being offered for free - grab it now while you can.  This is Book 1 of a three-part  series (hence the name trilogy), and I subsequently bought the others and enjoyed them.  I think the regular Kindle price is $2.99 - when it revert to non-free status it will be well worth the $2.99 investment. If you couldn't tell, I enjoyed this one and I am looking forward to reading more material from Thomas Stone!
