Great idea for a bag, low quality
Before this bag started to fall miserably apart, I really loved it. It had all the necessary pockets, and was great for a college student that didnt have more than 2 classes a day, but traveled by bus everywhere. It had enough room to hold my notebooks, pens, pencils, water bottle or umbrella, wallet, brush, some makeup, cellphone/ipod with headphones and laptop. That sounds like a lot of stuff, but as my textbooks aren't heavy, and my laptop is small, there wasnt much weight in the bag. I only had it for about a quarter (3 months) before it started to fray at the zippers! Now everything gets caught, fraying the lining even more. Great IDEA for a bag, but low quality!
