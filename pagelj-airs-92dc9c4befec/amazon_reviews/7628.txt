Great value for the money!
Bought this for myself for Christmas and as of 02/19/2013, great so far. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the uncontrollable automatic scroll it does if you move your finger in a certain way on the mouse pad. I haven't figured out how to keep that from happening. Otherwise great for everyday use, facebook gaming, students, etc.
