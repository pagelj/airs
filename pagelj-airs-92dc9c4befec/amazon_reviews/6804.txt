I got this handheld vacuum to pick up those small spills and get to hard to reach placed where you don't need or can't get your big vacuum to go. It is pretty heavy and has decent suction, but it fills up really fast and it is a bit of pain to clean the filter. Also note that it is not as compact as you may think it to be and actually takes up a decent amount of storage space for a handheld vac. Overall, not bad, but not great either. One thing is for sure, with its bright yellow color, you'll never lose it!
