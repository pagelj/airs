I bought a DeLognhi Retro espresso maker through Amazon, got it home, and just tried it. The OK light comes on, but when I turn it to the coffee drip position, it only makes noise but no water reaches the filter. I've put the filled water tank in and out several times, thinking maybe that was the problem, but it makes no difference. Plus, the steamer part is working, which means water is being received from the tank. Still, the coffee part does not get any water even after several minutes. I have put the handle in all positions, turning it as far to the right as possible, both with and without coffee in it and with and without the filter in it. Would love to be able to use this and not return it, especially since I bought $50 worth of pods that I'll have no other use for. Any help or ideas much appreciated!
