Bought blue and black. They look good.
I only saw all my orders yesterday for the first time, as I was travelling. First of all, delivery was great, in time. But make sure they don't just dump them at your door when you are not around. I was simply lucky nobody took them. Secondly, I like all my bags i bought from Amazon, but these are a bit smaller than I thought. They are out in the garden, to air and get rid of the plastic smell, but it is not an issue, clean air will do good, even to bags! :). I like them, and might order in other colours in the future.
