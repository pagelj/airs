Tiny little kid sized
This is a cute little tiny tomahawk but for the price it was worth having.  It's small enough that you can carry it in your BOB bags or even in your boot.  It's very small so don't plan on using it to build a house or anything but it would still be better than a dull knife.  My 4 year old looks like a badass holding it too.
