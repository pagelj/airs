Future of Tech
I have owned this chromebook for probably more than a month now. At first it was a huge pain in the ass. It certainly does take some getting use to but once you know how to use this device it is amazing. My biggest complaint, after acknowledging all of the major drawbacks of having a chromebook, was that this device couldn't play certain video formats at first. The workaround was to rename the videos to mp4, was pretty easy but very annoying when your watching a Supernatural marathon and that means over 75+ renames. You certainly can not get by with having this chromebook as your main computer unless all you do is Google Chrome because that is ALL it is. It does not have it's own apps. If you add an "app" from the Chrome Webstore it downloads a link which will open up your "app" in a tab. Clicking on settings will also take you to another tab in chrome. It is ALL chrome, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Once you understand that this is not a Windows or Mac or Linux computer you will start to see how easy it is to use, since it is only a web browser and nothing more. For this reason it would be perfect for kids or old people that don't know much about computers. It boots up in under 10 seconds, including time to input password. It goes from sleep to fully on in under 2 seconds. I don't know about the rest of you but that is ridiculously fast! Thousand dollar computers can't even do that, well none that I know of. The speakers are VERY LOUD! I am not an audiophile but the speakers are much more than I was expecting. The only con about them is you can cover them easily if you put them on your lap but it is still more than usable. The screen doesn't wow me but I wasn't expecting much. I like the matte display as it greatly reduces reflection. The keyboard feels pretty good. The trackpad feels decent, not premium but much better than some other ones. My only complaint with the trackpad is if you lift it up and click on things there is a possibility that it may get stuck but can easily be fixed by putting it down and clicking it again. I do a lot of homework on this. I completely forgo Microsoft Word and the other Office programs and I use Google Docs for everything. I love Google Drive. Not only does it have everything you need for work but when I have group projects, which is all the time, it is a LOT more convenient and very helpful being able to collaborate together in real time. Cloud storage is amazing too, especially with videos and how Google Drive has a YouTube player, doesn't actually upload videos to YouTube, that streams videos you upload. Incredibly cool when I am at school or at a friend's house and don't want to the movie but I can stream it. The 100GB is insane too, it doesn't even count the Google apps like Docs or Presentation! The battery life on this machine is amazing as well. I never need to use it more than several hours at a time and when i'm not using it I charge it. Regardless the battery life is easily 6hrs+. This is also INCREDIBLY light and thin as well. I would say that this feels lighter than the MacBook Air. Despite being plastic I feel like this is a premium device when I use it. It is SOOOOO worth the $250 price point! Despite my rocky start I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. tdlrPROS:-CHEAP-EASY TO USE-KEYBOARD FEELS GOOD-100GB CLOUD STORAGE-GREAT BATTERY LIFE-INSANE BOOT AND WAKE UP TIMES(UNDER 10 SECOND BOOT AND UNDER 2 SECONDS WAKE UP)-LOUD SPEAKERS-VERY THIN AND LIGHT-USB 3.0-HDMI-GOOGLE DOCS DOES EVERYTHING FOR WORK(LIKE WORD AND PRESENTATION BUT BETTER IN WAYS)-OVERALL FEELS PRETTY GOOD AND FASTCONS:-NOT TO BE USED AS ONLY COMPUTER DUE TO LIMITATIONS-ONLY CHROME, NO APPS-PAPERWEIGHT WITHOUT INTERNET-FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM VERY BASIC-LIMITED VIDEO FORMATS(CAN FIX BY RENAMING TO MP4)-CANNOT MAKE ME BREAKFAST IN BED!!!!!!
