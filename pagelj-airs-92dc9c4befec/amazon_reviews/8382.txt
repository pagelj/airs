perfect amount of power
I have used it 3x since it arrived a week ago. It charged up an Asus Infinity pad and a HTC Vivid. I am going to use it on my next trip. Can't wait, no more worrying if I charged up all my stuff before I get on a plane or looking for charge station. For the money it is the best. Since it is not brand specific it can be used with any of your phones or tablets.
