Helpful on a long walk
Works great and holds enough. The only challenge is that it tends to slide a little to one side if not perfectly balanced with counterweight. I have a small dog so I am careful to keep it light (a very small water bottle on each side, my phone, keys, and some keenex. Ok - call me lazy.
