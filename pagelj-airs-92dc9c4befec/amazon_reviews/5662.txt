well made but smaller than I expected
this was a christmas present for my son who intends to use it as his only piece of luggage for an extended vacation.  I'm not sure how well that will work as it is not quite as roomy as I expected.  It is well constructed and should take a beating and does have numerous pouches for holding smaller items and the price was the best I could find after shopping brick and mortar stores, and other online sites. Overall, we are pleased with this purchase and do expect it to be very useful.
