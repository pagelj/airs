Safe and comfortable for little ones...
I was so pleased to find these headphones! My twin girls discovered our old discmans (discmen?) a couple months before they turned nine. We were always worried about how high the volume was. These headphones don't allow the volume to go beyond a certain decibel. They also fit very nicely on their heads. Up until these headphones, they wanted to wear earbuds because the bigger headphones weren't comfortable. In one of the descriptions I read about these headphones, it made me think that you could manually control the volume with the headphones. This is not the case, but it doesn't really matter. The one downside for us is that we can hear what they are listening to even when the volume is low. I don't mind this as much as my husband. Overall, if you are going to let your kids use headphones, I highly recommend these!
