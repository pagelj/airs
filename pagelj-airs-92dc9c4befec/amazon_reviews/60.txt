Windows PC convert ... never a regret
A discounted price for a new Apple laptop is hard to find from a reputable company.... and then there is Amazon to save the day! As for the laptop, this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years. Prior to that we were die hard Dell / PC fans. After getting sick and tired off all the blue screens, the (what seemed like daily) updates, and the OS lock ups, we decided to give the Mac world a chance. While we have been faced with some limitations regarding software (getting better daily), the problems that are persistent with a Windows PC are all but gone. The huge accolad I can give to Apple is; they just plan work... period. With this laptop in particular, to review it, will take some time as it is pretty fresh out of the box (so far so good though). However, I dont expect it to be any different than the rest... awesome!
