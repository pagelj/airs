Unplesant Experience !
I have recieved the Apple iPhone (verizon version) screen, there were multiple issues with it:1. Toolkit provided was not sufficient, I need to buy another instrument to open screws near the screen from other store.2. Once I fit the screen and switched on the phone, the edges look brighter when the phone was booting up. (It should have been a completely black screen with only white apple logo, but now the screen is blackish but edges are hazy white). The screen edges remained hazy white and it looks like it is defective. Actually i can also see pixels - and an unexpected line on the top of the screen (like a line of pixels gone bad). It was a great pain to open the screen and it took me more than 3 hours to fit everything properly, with this screen edge brightness issue it seems the whole exercise was not sheer waste of time.
