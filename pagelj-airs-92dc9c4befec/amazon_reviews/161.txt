Great Sling!
I've had this sling for about 6 months now, and I absolutely love it! I have never liked big bulky bags and prefer easy to carry ergonomic light bags. This sling allows you to carry everyhing you need and barely even notice it's on your back. I am able to my camera, 3 lenses, battery charger, memory cards, and a hard drive. You can also get your lens cleaning stuff and some smaller odds and ends. It is exactly what I was looking for. I have been carrying it around on ball fields for the last six months and it is very durable and still performs as new. It also has plenty of adjustments to provide a good fit. This was a concern for me, (I'm 6'6 295lbs), and it has more than enough length to be comfortable.
