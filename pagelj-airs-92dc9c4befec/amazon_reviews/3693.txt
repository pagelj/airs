Best Lens Purchase Possible
I was thinking about getting the 50mm f/1.8 but once I went to the store and saw it I changed my mind. It already felt like a plastic toy that was going to fall apart in my hands. The manual focus ring is non-existent. The 50mm 1.4 on the other hand is a beauty. It really feels nice in the hand especially with a metal mount I can rely on. The full time manual focus is great even though this camera isn't a true USM. The low light focus ability of this lens is decent. Although the lens has somewhat of a soft focus at 1.4 is gets sharp at 1.8. All in all great lens. It id definitely worth paying extra over the f/1.8
