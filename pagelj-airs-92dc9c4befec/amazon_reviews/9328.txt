perfect for our use
These are flat and simple in design, a bit smaller than most flatware. This makes them compact to store and easy to keep clean, which is what we want in our truck camper. Edges are finished smooth, knives are sharp, a quality feel. Not that it matters, but they are labeled "Ikea" not "Fornuft"
