amazing deal for solid hardware
Simply put, this stand is far above expectations given the ~$50 shipped price I paid.  It's extremely stable when mounted on a stable desk, and the swing arm joints feel very solid as well. My only thoughts for improving this unit would be to allow for manual locking of the joints once they're positioned.  My co-workers think it's the height of hilarity to move my monitors around. While certainly not a failure of the stand (more of a failure of maturity lol) it would be nice to have manually tighten-able joints on the tilt and lateral adjustment points. Great equipment at a superb price.  All my co-workers have asked for the link so they can get their own - that's the best recommendation I can give it.
