I can breathe easier!
I have a very excitable 8 yr old who bounces around and also 2 6 month old kittens- I feel this product is a MUST HAVE! It works great and takes minutes to install. I actually have mine strapped to the ladder shelf that I have my new TV on, We chose not to wall mount it  and it really does work great!!!
