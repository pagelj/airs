Using a few dozen vacuums in my life, I finally decided to upgrade to a European model that does not rip off my carpet, that does not wake up everyone in the house, and that does not smell bad after using it for a few month. This vacuum cleaner is very compact, light but very powerful. So far I am using it in the lowest speed and the suction is still very high. Carpet looks good, very easy cleaning of steps since this model is not heavy and easy to carry with you. The build in floor option is good when vacuum tiles or concrete floor. The adjustable handle can be extended or collaps with a click of a button. For a quick spot suction you can remove the main handle quickly from the normal floor tool and can get the entire house cleaning done in a few minutes.
