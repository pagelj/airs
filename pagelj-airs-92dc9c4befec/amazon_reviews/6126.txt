Makes great coffee.  Hot enough for us.  We had an older model that lasted about three years, until moisture got the controls.  Needed a new one and it works just fine.  Maybe even a little quieter than the last model (yes its still a jet engine sound).  Plus a new charcoal water filter pellet feature (necessary, I don't know ....).  Best part is the old pot still fits. My only complaint is that there's no improvement in the internals - still a small hassle to clean the grinder each time.  But its worth it to get fresh ground coffee from my beans.
