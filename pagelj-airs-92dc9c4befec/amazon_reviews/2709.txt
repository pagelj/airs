Great results
First, the ordering process was easy and shipment was very timely.  Also, the help provided in the FAQ section of the company's website was very helpful to me on how to clean and attempt to remove stains on leather before using the Leather Honey product. I purchased two very old leather chairs from the college I work for which had not been cleaned nor treated for years (and I mean years.) I cleaned the leather lightly with a damp rag of soapy water (used diluted dish soap). I then did the same process with the vinegar/water mix as recommened in the FAQ.  Then treated the chairs with the leather honey and they came up very nice.  They were a burgundy/red leather - very traditional style and "hard" leather. It took some "elbow grease" to apply and then wipe down after waiting for it to work. I let the product stay on the chairs for 24 hrs before wiping it off. I even used the product on a newer leather chair I had purchased (brown, soft/cushiony leather) a few years back and it worked beautifully. Overall I was very pleased with the product and have already been recommending it to others.
