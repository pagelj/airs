Love the game BUT.....
I love this game but it is way too expensive to play. There are too many ponies that cost hundreds of gems to get and ponies you have to gamble for by spending even more gems. I might earn one or maybe two gems a day. Also the game has a ton of glitches when comes to connecting to Facebook and even gameloft. Most of the time my friends list won't even come up so I can't receive or send hearts. The hardest thing is for me is to go to my friends towns and leave chests (about 80% of the time I can't). Other than those things I do love the game play and animation.
