Pretty darned cool player. The remote, though...
I don't have much to add to the other reviews, and I like this unit a lot. It can do almost everything my Roku can do. I just don't, however, love the remote control (which is included, despite what they tell you in the Comparison Chart).  If you're using the smartphone remote app or a Harmony, you can stop reading now. My beef concerns the four directional arrows near the bottom, surrounding the 'OK' button. The arrows form a circle, such that each arrow is curved.  Unfortunately, just above that cluster is another set of curved arrows -- one for "pop up menu", the middle one marked "INTERNET", and the third for "picture".  And by "just above" I mean that it's all too easy, when trying to use the 'up' arrow, to mash the INTERNET button instead. This makes for no small amount of frustration. Otherwise, I like it a lot.
