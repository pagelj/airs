not made well.
Basically: the alignment of the oven door was warped a tiny bit when we took it out of the box from walmsrt. We thought it would be ok since the oven still worked. Over time .. about 7 months now... the door wont stay shut at all. It still works. The silver finish is cheap. The glass door is nice,  but doesn't shut. Update: the door shuts again after not shutting for 4 months. I still don't like the cheap metal it's made of.... you can cover the pan with aluminum foil though.
