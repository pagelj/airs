Fantasmic Book!
I wasn't so sure about the book at first. I'd read all the reviews, thought about it and decided to pick something totally out of my typical genre. I'm so glad I did! The book had a mystery feel to it at the beginning and just got more exciting from there. The characters were well developed throughout the book and left me guessing more than once before the end. What an exciting end it was! I would recommend this book to anyone that would like an exciting read. It doesn't leave you hanging, but it looks like there could be a sequel in the works...
