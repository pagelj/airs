Ok to be fair I have only used it one time so far. So I will report back in a few weeks. I had a Mr. Coffee and I really love coffee and wanted something with a "better" taste.  I wanted a Capresso, but they are so expensive.  So I am drinking  my third cup this morning. The flavor is so rich and smooth. It's so much better than the Mr. coffee it's unbelievable. I am only using Maxwell house and I used the setting on the coffee maker as regular.  Simple to set up and to use.  I have read many reviews about lukewarm coffee with this maker. The coffee was hotter than my Mr. coffee made.. no big feat I'm sure.. but it's hot enough to drink, yes, I wish it was a bit hotter, but mainly because it would stay hotter longer.  It won't burn your lips, that's for sure, but for me it is hot enough.  What I am impressed with is the flavor of the coffee.. yum!  4 stars because I wish it were a bit hotter and I have only used one time.
