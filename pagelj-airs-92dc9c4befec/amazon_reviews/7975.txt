not compatible with netflix
I bought this player yesterday to work with a new samsung flatscreen. Player works for discs and other apps but cannot connect to netflix. I was sent back and forth between netflix customer service and samsung customer service 4 times. Samsung customer service was horrible and the agent actually hung up on me. Netflix suggested buying another brand as Samsung dvd players apparently have trouble connecting to netflix servers. I will be returning this player. Samsung has lost me as a customer. I will now buy sony or panasonic or LG. Very disappointed.
