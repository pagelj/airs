Early "disaster" flick the predates "Armageddon"
George Pal's 1951 flick still holds the interest as it tells the tale of mankind's attempt to continue the species after the impending collision of the planet with a big old rock from space.  The effects were groundbreaking for the time, garnering Oscars.  Sure, there are no persons of color onboard the "space ark," and the "science" was unbelievably absurd.  However, the film does entertain and features some realistic scenes of destruction, courtesy of great matte paintings. Although there are no "stars" in the cast, character actor John Hoyt stands out in a role he perfected in so many films and television shows: a pompous aristocrat whose sole purpose in life is self-preservation at the expense of others.  As the "villain" of the piece, he makes for one who is easy to "hiss."
