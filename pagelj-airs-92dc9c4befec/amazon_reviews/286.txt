Best value purchase I have ever made
It has been now 3 months since I bought this camera. This is probably the best value purchase I have ever made considering the price and features offered. I use it to monitor my 1.5 year old, works great even in complete darkness, never had any problems from day one. Easy to setup, came with not much documentation (in a way that is good) cause whatever documentation it had was to the point. Some technical details as I understand it: The camera has an embedded OS, with DHCP client and built-in web server capable of streaming jpg/mpeg images at a high refresh rate, it has infrared lights to see at complete darkness, capability to rotate the camera left/right or up/down remotely, jpeg streaming is what makes it work in most modern browsers without the need to install Activex/Java, although there is an added Activex version for IE that gives more control to the user, it does all that wirelessly, I don't know about you but I am not aware of any device that can do all that at such a low price. I generally don't write reviews but the product is so good that I had to write one. I can't think of any product that has such a low price to features ratio.
