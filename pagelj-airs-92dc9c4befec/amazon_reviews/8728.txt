Nearly perfect walking-around camera.
I did a LOT of research. An obsessive amount. This was the winner, and now that I'm using it I am not disappointed. Quibbles: You can't shoot RAW format in Intelligent-Auto mode. Which is a pity because IA mode is awesome. But at least the JPEG creation on this camera is superior to the LX5 (the previous model). The LX5 JPEGs were really messy. These are cleaner. Another quibble, although I appreciate the ability to adjust exposure compensation, the multipurpose dial and software implementation is a bit fiddly. I'd prefer a dedicated control for this. The lens cap. It has a lens cap. Really annoying in a P&S. I keep forgetting to take it off, and I'll probably lose it eventually. And a completely unreasonable quibble: no dedicated microphone jack. You won't be using this for commercial film production, despite the video quality. But almost no camera in this price range has a mic jack anyway. (The onboard stereo mics are fine, as far as they go.)Raves: The lens. The low-light capability. The way it fits your hand. The lens again. The fast focusing. The excellent VR. True HD movie-making. Responsive, fast operation. It's a small sensor, so there will be noise at high ISO, but it is not too objectionable and looks very much like natural film grain. With adequate light, the pictures are quite smooth. This is my 4th Lumix. Panasonic is doing a very good job.
