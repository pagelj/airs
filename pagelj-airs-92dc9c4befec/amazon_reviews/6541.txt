Mr. Inverter
Needed an inverter for a 25 day road trip, this powered and charged many of my devices including a MacBook Pro, mobile phones, powered USB hubs (to charge USB devices) and camera batteries. I was impressed it charged my laptop while I was using it since I had a previous inverter that, when I plugged in an (old) laptop with battery, something happened with the battery and it wouldn't charge. Anyway, great product. 175 watts (or as someone said, 130 watts or so through DC) is enough for your typical electronic devices, just check your watts before buying.
