Not Really
I enjoy fiction, and I enjoy paranormal fiction. I even enjoy fiction involving werewolves. So before I read any of them, I bought all the books in the series. It didn't take me as long as it may perhaps take some folks to finish, because I skipped through all the torrid sexual encounters. And there are lots of them! After the first panting, breathless hook-up between Elise and Kane, I knew all I needed to know about that subject. I am neither a skilled editor or reviewer; but the story, the characters, and the dialogue all seemed superficial and a bit shallow to me. I would find myself skipping ahead to try to get to some "meat."I couldn't determine which book in the series was first; so I started with this one. I then began the next one, but after about 30 minutes I decided I was done. With all of them.
