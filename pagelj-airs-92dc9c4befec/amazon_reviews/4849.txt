Not very reliable, and not easy to use either
I bought this product for a recent camping trip. I was hoping to use it to keep our cellphones charged. Well, within the first hour it shut down and only charged my phone to 7%, soon after that, the "reset" button wouldn't do it's only job of "resetting". It was extremly frustrating and I wound up intermittently charging the cellphones in my truck. I tossed the packaging otherwise, this thing would be returned. I'm give 2 stars for the shippers prompt delivery, not for the panels performance.
