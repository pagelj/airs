I picked this very short ebook up free, as well as many others. It was well written, be forewarned, the story is fast paced! Since this appears to be a teaser for a series, Dane and Charlie are old flames, and he doesn't expect to find her in town when he comes home after ten years away. He has his reasons for leaving, and though he deserves everything Charlie dishes out, you still feel compassion for them both. Their chemistry is electric hot and their past only helps turn up the heat even higher than they could ever imagine. The pages turn themselves and the sex sizzles, read the whole series. You will not be disappointed.
