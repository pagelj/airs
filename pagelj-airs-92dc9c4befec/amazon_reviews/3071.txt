This is one of those kind of things that you don't have to read the instruction manual to figure out.  I love how well it works but also how simple it is.  When I first got it I thought I would leave the hot water side on all the time, but I found that it makes me feel guilty to hear it keep heating up to keep the water hot and I don't drink THAT much tea or cider.  So now when I know I'm going to want a cup I just hit the button and wait a minute (literally) and it's ready.  I love this aspect.  The timer is very easy and I love having hot coffee ready for me as soon as I get out of bed.  Another thing I love is the dripless spout!  No more messes all over the counter. Great coffee maker for the price!
