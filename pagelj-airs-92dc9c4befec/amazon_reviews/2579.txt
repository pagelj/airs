Ultimate Test To See If Lojack For Mac Works ...
Everyone knows that Macs and PCs are different. PCs have BIOS chip on the motherboard, whereas Macs do not. Lojack for PC will activate certain function of it in the BIOS, so even if the hard disk is wiped clean or even replaced with a different hard disk, tracing the computer once it is connected to the Internet is still possible. Lojack for Mac seems to be entirely software-only that resides on the built-in hard disk. To test this, just take out the hard disk on the Mac where you have Lojack installed and put in another hard disk. Connect the Mac to the Internet and see if Lojack headquarters can detect its location. Formatting and wiping the hard drive on a Mac may or may not erase the hidden Lojack files. You will need to test this. The SSD type of "hard disk" on MacBook Air is pretty easy to replace. Therefore stolen MBA's can have their SSDs swapped out easily. So far, perhaps only the MacBook Pro with Retina Display would discourage thieves from stealing it, since its SSDs are glued to the chassis and are extremely difficult to remove. You can also consider Google's Chrome OS computers: Chromebook and Chromebox. You would never lose your precious data, because they are always stored in the "cloud".
