only a few difficulties with Canon camera
The only problems I have are:There is no book. There is a CD, so I have to have my computer nearby if I want to look up something about the camera. I sometimes turn off the camera when I mean to press the shutter button (it is close to the power button). I often press playback when I am setting up for a shot. Again, button in a bad place. I don't know how to use it in low light. (No book with me when I'm trying to figure it out). The movie setting only takes pictures, until you take a wild guess and press the red button. After taking a picture, it takes a full 1-2 seconds to get the screen back to see what the next picture will be. Frustrating when taking several pics of a moving event. I like that I can zoom during videoing.
