With two dogs, we have a lot of shedding during the summer. As a result, we keep a heavy duty vacuum cleaner to ensure we can pull up the fur. So, while I was willing to try the dirt devil, I wasn't expecting it to do a lot. I figured it would come in handy for small jobs. But I was pleasantly surprised at how much it picked up running it down the hallway!  One small trip, and it had picked up loads of dog fur. Besides having good suction, this was incredibly easy to put together. Everything simply snaps together. No screws, no confusion. When needed, the HEPA filter can be washed. And it is incredibly light! I noticed in the instructions that it has a safety feature to keep the motor safe, if there is a problem and it heats up, it has a 30 minute thermal protector that times out. Because of the size of the cup, I do suggest that this is best used for smaller areas. But the small footprint also makes it perfect for getting into areas like bathrooms and around highchairs. With the ease of assembly, the small footprint, the lightweight yet mobile capability, I really do see this as perfect for a dorm room as well, especially given the price. I can't attest to its ability to stand up over time, but I will be enjoying it as a supplement to my larger, much heavier and bulkier vacuum. Edited - after my daughter joined our household, she pointed out that the whole thing fits tighter if you actually use the one provided screw! So a screwdriver is recommended.  But with or without the screw, I haven't had to bring my big vacuum out nearly as much. This little Dirt Devil does a great job of keeping things picked up.
