Roku TV vs apple vs cable
I love this thing. Very skeptical at first. My son encouraged me to get it. Got it and signed up with Amazon Prime. I was going to get an Apple TV. I wanted Apple Tv to be able to run things off my ipad and show pictures etc. if i wanted to. My son has both. Roku much more versatile. Lots of free apps for it and of course Amazon Prime. 2 day shipping on most stuff and good selection of TV and movies for rent, buy, or free. If you get the Roku app you can make your iPad the remote and ..... make it Apple TV ! I dumped my cable service and upped my net speed thru them. I will save 60$ a month, $ 720 a year by doing this. Love the fact I pick and choose what I want to watch, when I want to watch it. Not DVR ! So if your into that this may not be for you. But if you like to save money, dump your cable service, shop on Amazon a lot and like two day shipping... this might be the new hot thing.
