great camera bag for the novice photographer
This bag is great! I needed something to keep my new Nikon D3000 secure and safe while I traveled back and forth to studio. It's a lot bigger than I thought. Easily fitting 2 or three cameras and multiple lenses. The only minor complaint I have is that it does not have enough room in any of the pockets for a regular sized laptop. I really like this bag and for the price, you won't find a better product.
