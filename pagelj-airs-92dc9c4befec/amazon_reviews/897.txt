Nice Picture
This DVD player seems to be a very good model. I bought it for my 3 year old granddaughter and I would suggest to have an adult set up the operation........ like inserting the DVD and start the process because the lid is very thin and it appears that it could break very easily. Other than that, I am satisfied with the player. Taking it in the car is a great thing for my daughter and she is in love with the idea. We haven't had it long enough to give a use rating yet, but I think with proper care it will last a long time.
