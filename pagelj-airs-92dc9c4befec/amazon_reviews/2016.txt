Great Starter Kit for a Bachelor
I bought this set as I needed some knives for my new place. The reviews were right, this is a great kit! All of the knives are razor-sharp, so much so that I am extra careful with them. I haven't used them extensively, but the few times that I have, they've worked excellent. I also like the aluminum handles. It was kind of strange at first to use, but now I really like them. I've seen other peoples knife sets with plastic handles get faded and worn looking after awhile, but these should have no such issues. Overall, A+ product!
