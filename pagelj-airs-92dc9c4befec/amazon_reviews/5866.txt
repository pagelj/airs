Purchase of "Lemon" for a Galaxy Phone from Worldwide Distributors
I am appealing to all persons buying phones on Amazon from Worldwide Distibutors be careful.  They are selling phones made in Hungary with all instructions not in English. My experience after purchasing phone from Amazon (Worldwide Distributors) after 2 months the phone was no longer working, it just went off, after testing battery which was good, I realized I was sold a faulty phone. I wrote Amazon and Worldwide Distributors on three occassions and all Amazon did is to keep referring me to Worldwide Distributors.  Worldwide Distributors keep referring me Samsung.  Samsung couldn't help since they cannot understand how the phone count out so quickly. I am stocked with a phone costing me $534.00 US after just 2 months with no help from both Amazon and Worldwide DIstributors.  To this day Amazon never tried to help me or even apologise to me for selling me a "Lemon".  I will not even think of purchasing anything from Amazon again until this problem is solved.  I am seeking a new authentic Samsung Galaxy Phone to replace the faulty one I now have.  I have informed all the persons I know not to buy on Amazon, because they do not take care of customeres when they are sold faulty products  Please heed this call customers.
