I like it.
I read the reviews before I bought this awesome oven, but there is one thing that needs to be mentioned:  YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHECK ON YOUR FOOD CONSTANTLY AND/OR WORRY ABOUT OVERCOOKING IT!!  You set it and forget it.  The oven turns itself off!!!! I've only had it for 2 days.  So far, I've cooked frozen pizza, potato skins, Jalapeno poppers and cookies, all of which turned out perfect for Superbowl Sunday snacks. The convection setting is perfect for making your foods extra crisp! Alas, I must end my review because I must search Pinterest for some culinary creations to cook in my new oven.
