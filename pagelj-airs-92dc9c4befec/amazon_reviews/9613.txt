decent phone
I bought this for my 20 yr old son. Pros: He likes the phone because of the qwerty keyboard because he texts a lot. Cons: He says it is a quiet phone. The audio is weak, so it can be hard to hear him when he calls. He has also had trouble with the phone's alarm clock feature being unreliable and it doesn't have a loud alarm.
