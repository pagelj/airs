Before we made our purchase we read about the lid challenges. We don't have that as an issue, but we are mindful that it is possible to get it wrong, defiantly not a game stopper. We did find the base of the unit does not slide on our tile counter and we like to move it underneath the overhanging cupboards when not in use. My wife came up with a simple solution. She sits the coffee maker on a small cutting board with a handle, that allows us to slide the unit back and forth with ease. We are very pleased with the coffee maker, and impressed at how long the coffee in the pot stays hot.
