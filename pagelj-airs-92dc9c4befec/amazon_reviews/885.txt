If you have kids and a DVD player in your car these are a must
They work great - better than the OEM Audiovox ones.  They are a little smaller so fit my kids better and the sound is great.  We have a two channel system but these work great with it and the kids tend to both watch the same DVD anyway.  Not to mention they are only $15 so you don't care if they break them.
