Great HDMI Cable
I know what you're thinking.  The kid at <local electronic store> just tried to sell me one for $45 and that was the cheapest one in the store!  So how is this one $3? It's fine, the in store markup is really that much.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this cable.  Order it right now, then pat yourself on the back for not falling for the kid's sales pitch.
