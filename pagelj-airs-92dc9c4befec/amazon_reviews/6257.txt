I purchased this product to make a cup of tea every morning before I go to work.  I have also used it for coffee on occasion.  I like that the water comes out hot and there is no weird taste to it.  I also like that you can raise the platform if you are using a mug. This is helpful to prevent water from splashing out onto the counter top.  This unit is very quiet, I can brew a cup of tea in the morning while the rest of the house hold is sleeping with no worries.  There is nothing negative about this unit.
