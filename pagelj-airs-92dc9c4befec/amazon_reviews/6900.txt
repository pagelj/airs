Decent Adapter!
For a dollar this thing is awesome. My phone has a 2.5mm jack for some godawful reason, so I use this to connect my normal headphones to the smaller size jack. It is stereo, but sometimes if the wire moves around it turns to mono. Easy fix- just move the wire back! This was supposed to get to my house in a month, which is understandable because I've ordered things from China before and they can really take a while to make it, but I was surprised when it showed up in about a week! Buy it already!
