Had a problem with 1st convection oven, but new one works perfectly!
(January 2011) I recently bought this oven after reading many of the reviews and hoping that mine would not be defective as some of the reviews stated.  However, tonight after using my oven between 10-15 times, the convection oven fan started making a very loud noise as if it was falling apart.  I am returning the oven for a refund and am going to look at other, hopefully more reliable, ovens here at Amazon. ***UPDATE***: (January 2012)  I decided that I would try another one so instead of returning the first one I exchanged it.  Amazon did a great job and was very fast in getting me a new oven.  I have not had any problems with the new one and it has been a year since I first got it.  So if you wish you purchase this oven know that if you do have a problem with it that it may be a quirk and let Amazon replace it for you.  I bake everything in it and love the oven very much!
