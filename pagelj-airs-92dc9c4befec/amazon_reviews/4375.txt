Replacing my kitchen trash can was far more difficult than I would have supposed. I thought I'd run down to Target or Loews and get one to replace my old stainless steel model, which was hopelessly dinged and rusted. It took me weeks, first locally, at every department and home improvement store, then online. Nothing seemed to meet my needs. Cut to this model. I was a bit leery of the whole battery-driven automatic top. That held me back for a week or two. Finally, I surrendered and picked up this Nine Stars model. I'm back at Amazon now, ready to pick up another one for my darlin' Mother-in-Law. Now, my review, several months of use later:The good:  - Automatic lid is effortless, smooth, and - honesttogawd - fun to use. Never again will I fool with a foot pedal.  - Went for the larger 21.1 gallon size on a lark. The capacity now makes taking out the trash a once/twice per week deal, down from 4-5 times per week with smaller model.  - Look is polished steel, crisp and clean.  - I have yet to replace the batteries, though the steel beast is in constant use.  - Bag replacement is incredibly easy. Anyone who has difficulty with this model is clumsy, to say the least. The bad:  - Nothing. Nada. Zip. It's all good, baby. I recommend this device fully and robustly. Thanks, Amazon.
