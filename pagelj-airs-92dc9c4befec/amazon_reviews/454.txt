Most of my floors are tile, so I love this pretty red lightweight vacuum. It is not good for carpets. It does have great suction, swivel handle for moving around furniture and hard to reach places, easily follows me around the house, very easy to change bag which last a long time, long cord, crevice tool rides on top for easy reaching, on and off switch on top so I can operate with my foot, top of handle has curve so hangs on door knob or chair if I leave it, and has a strong handle, cord, and hose. Some people did not like the non-retractable cord stored at the bottom, but that is really not a problem. The vacuum stands up on the back wheels so the cord is easy to wind up and store the vacuum is a small space.  It comes with a floor attachment that has two features. One switch sounds like it is scratching the floor so I use the other option which has brushes on it. This works nicely, but dog hairs gather on it sometimes. I just turn it over, pull out the hairs, and they get sucked up. That is the only problem I could find and it is very minor. This is a great vacuum for a great price and I highly recommend it!
