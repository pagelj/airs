Sent it back!
Dell would blame Windows 8 for their declining sales, but that's far from being the entire story. If Dell wants people to buy their computers, then they need to first look at the package they are currently offering in comparison to what the other brands are providing. My recent purchase of an i15R Inspiron was rather disappointing from the very start until finally having it shipped back to the supplier. I simply could not complete anything I tried to do with it. It has no User Guide to reference, nor could I even complete a back up of the factory restore provision to my DVDs. That's not all. Although comments about Dell are favorable in regard to their follow-up support, some new innovation in design is what is really on order. Other brands do quite well by first making sure that the purchaser has the complete package delivered to them from the get-go, and then having sufficient resources readily available for doing some good old fashioned research and updating. In a comparison of the rather uninspiring Inspiron to the latest offerings from other brands, a Dell can't bend over backwards, twist, or even resemble the Star Ship Enterprise, but it did leave me with a lasting impression of opening up a tackle box instead of a state of art laptop computer.
