Great upgrade!
I'm an eighteen year old amateur who started out with a D40x last year.  I've been taking a ton of photos for my school's yearbook (the biggest in the world!) and I was getting a lot more serious about photography.  About 3 months ago, I decided to upgrade, mostly for the greater range of customization. I have a few friends with canons who actually suggested Nikon and I can safely say that I am MORE than satisfied with my choice to go with the D90. I LOVE it. The picture quality is great, the video (though I don't use it much) is a great feature and has amazing quality, and everything else about it is so functional. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to upgrade and get a little more serious about photography!
