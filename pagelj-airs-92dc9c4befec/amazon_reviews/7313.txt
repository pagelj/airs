The Atlantis Gene:  A Thriller (The Origin Mystery, Book 1)
The A. G. Riddle book started out "hitting the floor running."  It peaked about the middle, and then went downhill from there.  It seemed that the author got tired and slowed down.  The ending was nothing much to me.  I was looking forward to reading his whole series.  Hope his next book has a little more pizzazz!
