Looong
I finally finished it, but boy, it was a bitch of a read. Not sure if I caught all the threads, therewere many, but the damned thing kept bringing me back, just to find out what would happen next. I think this series has been going on way too long, and is way too convoluted, but I will probably get six, I've come this far. For those who have not yet started, or are on the first book in the series, I recommend watching the HBO series instead.
