This coffee pot almost caused a serious problem. It worked well until we made the 34th pot of coffee since ordering 2-15-13. On the 35th pot trouble started. We make coffee in the morning and always leave about 1 cup of coffee that we do not drink. We depend on the coffee maker to automatically shut off, as it has done for about 5 weeks. But alas, when I started to prepare the coffee pot to make coffee for the next morning the pot had boiled dry and every thing was very hot. The only way you could stop the coffee maker from heating was to unplug. The pot is dangerous. It is disturbing that the return policy is I pay for return postage, and I will get a partial refund, how much? Not worth the effort. It would perhaps be a net loss for me to return. I think I will replace with a coffee maker from a store where I can walk up with the return and have it taken care of then. This makes me rethink my current buying habits where we purchase a lot of stuff from Amazon. com. This will be my last experience with Hamilton Beach.
