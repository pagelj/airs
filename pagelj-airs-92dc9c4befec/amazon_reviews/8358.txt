This is all I have to say
I've had this phone for a month now.  I like the phone.  Most of what the other people said it true, good and bad.  But the best part is pulling this out and comparing it with the iphones.  The phone doesn't seem that big, but put it up to the iphone.... and well... the iphone owners want to hide their little phone.  They all give me that same embarrassed look as they smile, and say with their faces,  "But it's an iphone."
