Nice to have.
I purchased this along with my new Paperwhite. To be honest, something this simple should be included with every Kindle free of charge. If I wanted to plug my Kindle into my laptop every time I wanted to charge it, I wouldn't need WiFi or 3G either because I would be hard wired in so much.  The idea of the WiFi is not having to be plugged into a laptop. This is sad, should be included. As far as functionality, it works just like any other power to USB adapter.
