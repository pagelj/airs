Get a used iPad instead. (This is NOT a laptop replacement)
I am an avid googler! email, maps, search, you name it. But Chromebook is an absolute limited device that defeats the purpose of owning a laptop. I have an Apple MacBook Air 11 inch (chromebook was a fathers day gift).  As far as the quality of the device goes, comparing to the macbook air it is just great for $250. the shortcomings come from the limited application pool.  for anything useful like Skype or other audio/video tools you are 100% limited to the google "hangouts".  So if you think that this is a laptop replacement, you are very much mistaking. You cannot use your apps from the Android market.  The applications are VERY VERY limited.  again, this is not a replacement for a laptop. I got a refurb iPad3 from apple for $100 more and now i'm not limited to JUST google apps.  My dad can Skype and a whole range of other applications without being limited.
