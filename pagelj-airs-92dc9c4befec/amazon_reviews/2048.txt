LOVE THEM!
I bought this knifes as a bday present from me to myself!! I can't be more pleased. The knifes have perfect weight, suuuper sharp and the handle is ergonomical perfect. At first I was a little concerned about the bamboo block, because in the picture doesn't look that fancy, but actually it is really beautiful (a little bigger than I tought). By far the best bday present!!
