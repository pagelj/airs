Works great- shipped in 2 days with prime!
Cracked the original LCD screen trying to figure out why my first attempt replacing the digitizer screen was only responsive to half the the screen (turned out to be a defective part I ordered).  Bought this and watched a couple of you tube videos- replacement went flawlessly- works perfectly!
