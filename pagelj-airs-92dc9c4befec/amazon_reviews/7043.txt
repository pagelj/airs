One great axe!
The axe arrived, and it was awesome.  But, when i started throwing at and old stump, it wouldn't stick.  Even after a good sharpening it still won't stick.  The blade scratches very easily, on the first day it already a a few scratches on the blade.  The spike is great though.  Good tool for mutilple things.  Just not really for throwing.....
