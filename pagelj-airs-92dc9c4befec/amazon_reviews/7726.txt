Ease of Access
I like to install this type of bracket over the flat to wall VESA mounts.  You don't have to take the monitor off the wall to get to the connectors and you can either aim the monitor where you want, then put it back flush to the wall.  I've even used these to mount monitors through drop ceilings.
