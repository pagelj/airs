Christmas surprise kindle needed STRONG protective accessories
My experience with touch electronics was nil.  We have little phones  with slide out texting keyboards but would use our phones for sending and receiving calls only!  The kindle fire needed protection from daily unfamiliar use, dust, scratches and constantly being prodded by a stylus.  After a lot of research, the Moshi IVisor fit the bill.  It could not have been easier to put on the kindle and I have never taken it off.  It matches the machine and looks like something that was factory installed.  I have no glare, no scratches and the smudges and finger prints wipe right off.  This is an amazing piece of genius that I would recommend to everyone.  I will definitely give these away as gifts! Thanks for a product that is what it claims to be.
