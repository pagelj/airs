This phone is great even with android 1.6
Is a really good phone, a good deal for the actual price. For my mom was not a big problem use it. It comes with the android version 1.6 but i didn't update because some review thru internet says the phone get a little slow with the Androd 2. xx version, so i just prefer more speed than applications. With the applications that are available 1.6 is ok for my mom. But Motorola webpage offer the upgrade, so is not something like you need root your phone.
