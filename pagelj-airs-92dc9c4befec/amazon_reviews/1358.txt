Eneloop AAA Rechargable Batteries
The Sanyo Eneloop batteries are the best I have found as far as AAA's are concerned.  I ordered a couple packages and they were received on time.  I have been using them in my kids toys, video games and remotes.  I've only had them a short time but I have saved more then a few dollars by not having to go to the store and buy standard AAA's. The Eneloops are out-lasting the standard AAA's by far and I don't have to worry about recycling all those standard batteries.  They also keep for a long time after charging which makes them invaluable for when my kid's controller or toys need fresh batteries.  I also like the fact the Eneloops are white, it makes it easy to tell they are not standard batteries and accidentally throw them away, and it's easy to mark them so I can rotate them in use.  I recommend them to anyone that uses a lot of AAA's.  I will be ordering a lot more of the Eneloops. The Eneloops are made in Japan and a lot of the other rechargeable batteries are made in China.  I have found that the ones made in China aren't made as well as the ones made in Japan.  My advise, stay away from the ones made in China like the Ansmann batteries, they're junk and don't last very long.
