This appliance is working great, is a good value, and I'm really enjoying it.  It makes delicious lattes, and as I've become more proficient in increasing the milk's volume, I discovered my favorite Krupp's 12 ounce pitcher is no longer large enough.  Both 1% and 2% milk work very well with equal success, and I don't bother using the frothing aid. But I always chill the stainless steel pitcher before adding cold milk and starting the frothing process. This appliance maker would do well to re-engineer the oddly shaped, texture-less water reservoir cap and control knob.  I also agree with others about the too-short electrical cord (yes, it's completely unwrapped).
