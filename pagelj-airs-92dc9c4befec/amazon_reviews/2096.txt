We have had THREE of these!  At first, it was a hose, but it was more of a hassle to replace it and go without coffee, so we got another one.  Next was the plate in the bottom of the canister.  If you scrub it with anything but a feather touch, you will unhinge it and it pours the coffee all over your cabinet, floor... etc.  and you will exhaust yourself scrubbing it like that because who has time to seriously take half an hour for that?  THEN, we learned what not to do but clean it regularly and then the screen!  That little screen it so hard to clean that you can't maneuver a brush, a rag or finger to get ALL the gunk so it clogs faster and, thus, more often.  We have spent so much on the 3 of these (now hear this) in 3 years, that it would have been ultimately more frugal to pay more for a more expensive coffee maker overall!  You will have to replace this every year if you buy it and chances are, after the warranty expires.......... go figure.  Lesson learned!
