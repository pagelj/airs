Amazing pictures in/out doors but apparent white noise in video
Amazing indoor outdoor pictures. But there is obvious white noise recorded during video taking. For a recording of very quiet scene, you will definitely notice it. However, considering its amazing picture quality, I will say this is a keeper! Wifi connection with my iPhone 5 was smooth through my wifi router at home. The camera itself works as wifi hotspot, which lets you connect your smart device directly to S110. I'm giving 4.5 stars!
