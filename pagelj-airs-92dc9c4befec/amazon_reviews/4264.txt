Very Well Written
I picked this up because I had seen it listed on numerous 'best of' lists in regards to not only science fiction, but coming of age stories. I do commend the book for many of the same reasons, that the rules of the science fiction in question are well established and well followed, that the characters act consistently within the story to advance their own characters and the unfolding narrative that is their relationships with each other, and that the overall impending conflict does not overshadow any singular struggle within the story, but instead helps each to be seen as a firm stepping stone on the path to the final climax of the narrative. Where this book rises above is that it is not the story of the everyman, the person who has hidden talents that are only brought out and explored because they are the chosen one, but instead that the main character is the smartest person on Earth, the youngest sibling of two of the other smartest people on earth.  This isn't a story about how we need to discover in ourselves the magic to save the day nonsense, this book is about those who have talent needing the strength and support to use it to its fullest, to not break applying their unstoppable intellect against the immovable ignorance of the world.  They are the best, they are the brightest, and the world needs them.  I feel this message is a good one, that sometimes it isn't the typical person who has to rise above, it has to be the exceptional person who defies expectations. It is a spectacular book.  Read it.
