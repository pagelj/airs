Canon 2400 SLR Gadget Bag for EOS SLR Cameras
Nice bag, although a little small for handling very many camera parts.  The main compartment holds my T3i with standard lens, extra battery clip and a few other small pieces, and nothing else.  If I put my upgrade lens on, there is no room left for anything else.
