Don't buy this phone
This phone would not charge the batteries if you waited until the "low battery" indication appeared. It would just contunie to recycle the bat low sign and would not charge the battery. I had to put the batteries into the old LG phones these phones replaced to charge them. IF you placed the batteries on charge before the low bat indication, they would charge. I bought two of these phones and they both had this problem. I returned the phones but the seller charged me $28 to restock them. Would not recommend the seller either. Just don't waste you money or time with this product.
