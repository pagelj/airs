I purchased this coffeemaker a few days ago and I love it so far. It's a huge upgrade from my dinky $20 Mr. Coffee machine. The thing I get the most use out of is the single serve side -- I'm usually the only person in my house who drinks coffee regularly, so it saves a lot of time and a lot of coffee to just have that setting. The programming works perfectly. I have mine set to brew in the mornings before my classes and it hasn't given me any problems yet. It brews really fast and I like that you can change it to a bold setting. I just made a cup and it was finished before my breakfast was done cooking. My coffee comes out smooth-tasting and pleasant, but I do wish the single serve side got hotter.  The single serve side would also probably be useful for brewing loose leaf tea. I haven't used the carafe just yet but overall the design of the machine is really sleek. I love the blue LED clock and the silver and black accents. The travel mug, as people have stated, is by and large useless. You'd have better luck brewing it in the travel mug and then transferring it to your own thermos. And the machine itself is pretty big. If you have low cabinets I can see that being a problem. I have a microwave rack... thing over one of my counters and I had to pull the coffeemaker out to get the water in if I plug it in near the microwave, so I transferred it to another counter instead. I wish there were more places to buy pods in stores but I'm going to order a couple of packages off of Amazon. I'm looking forward to using those. Overall I'm glad I made this purchase. It's pretty affordable for the performance and all the settings it has. I'm not really a big coffee aficionado so I don't know if people into something fancier when it comes to coffee would dislike this product, but for every day coffee drinkers it works great.
