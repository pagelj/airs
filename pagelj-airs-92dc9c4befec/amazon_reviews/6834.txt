Worst costumer service EVER!
Received the product Friday.  Turns out a speaker is defective.  Called Dell today only to be switched from one customer service guy to the next and after being on hold for a total of 1 1/2 hours they hung up on me.  The last person who put me on hold said that he doesn't know what to do if a product is defective and he was going to put me on hold and find out. Phone got disconnected during my hold time and nobody bothered to call back.  As if my defective computer would be magically fixed because I was passed around from one rep to the next.  Tried getting back in touch with them only to get the voice response system that kept saying "sorry, I didn't understand that" and after me telling it over and over again that I want customer service I finally got a live person on the phone.  That person also passed me off to another department and that voice mail said that they are only open M-F, as if the person who transferred me who works at Dell didn't know that!  Then I call again and get another person who tells me the same thing and I ask to speak to manager.  Some guy comes on the phone and says "sorry for the inconvenience" and that I have to call back Monday.  Nobody cared that I was on the phone with them for over 2 hours at this point only to find out that I have to wait until Monday.  I don't know what will happen on Monday but at this point I want to return this defective laptop and get my money back just so I never have to deal with such incompetent people again.
