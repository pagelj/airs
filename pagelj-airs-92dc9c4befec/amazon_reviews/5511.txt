Love this netbook
At first I was afraid to buy the netbook but now I am truely glad I did.  I read alot of the reviews on here good an bad and must say I don't understand the bad ones at all.  It is a great size, very lightweight, great cam/mic, and the full size keyboard is a real plus.  The fact that you don't need an antivirus program and you don't need to worry about running out of power (it has a six and a half hour battery life) is another big plus in my book.  I like the google chrome software and honestly have no complaints about it.  I have a tablet but it's limited since you need a keyboard to really do alot of things on the internet.  This netbook fits the bill. So if you are thinking about getting a netbook but not sure if you'll like this one........ you will..... don't worry.
