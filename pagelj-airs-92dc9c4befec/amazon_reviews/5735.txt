Goody!
Reading was just as good as the first! That's not always the case, but this book has a little of everything. Lots of steamy scenes, a sweet guy and a family secret that will have your mouth dropping open in shock! Logan McNarry is not your typical bad boy but I promises you'll love him. Hello did you see the hot marine on the cover, what's not to love. (and I'm lucky to say I married one!) He is definitely one of sweetest book men I've read about, he falls head over heels and he has no plans on denying it. Mattie on the other hand already has her life mapped out and never really gave much thought to any other path. That is until a drunken call from her cheating boyfriend leads her straight into Logan. Logan stirs something in Mattie she never knew existed and certainly never felt. After an amazing encounter Mattie whole future is in question. Of course nothing is easy but one thing for sure love and fate always seem to win, right?"Logan: 6:10 am Today-I miss you. Quickly I typed in a return message: I'm not even at the end of the street yet. Logan: 6:11 am Today-That's too far, come back?"
