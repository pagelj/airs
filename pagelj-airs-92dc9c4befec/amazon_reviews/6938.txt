Works Pretty Good
I have had this product for at least 5mths, and it still works great. It is great for what I need, which is single use and on the go. You have to pulsate some harder items, but it blends very well. Just this morning I blended one apple, frozen mango, oatmeal, and milk. It tasted great. I saw the other reveiwers who complaied that it ran over. One thing you have to remember is that it is a single serve blender and you can't fill it to the brim and not expect it to run over. I purchased my single serve blender from Walmart for $15. I haven't had any problems with it. It still works. I do smell a burning smell when it is working hard to blend something. That is why I've found pulsating and stoping and shaking the cup a little to get the contents rotating helpful. Overall for the price and purpose, this blender works well. I have other hamilton beach products and have not had any problems with them. I would give it 5 stars if there was a way you could buy a replacement or extra blending cup. That part sucks.
