I bought this vacuum as a second vacuum because it was inexpensive and I didn't want to purchase a pricey model because they all seem to go in a few years.  So far it has worked very well considering all the pet hair it has to pick up, and I won't feel bad if and when I have to replace it because I paid so little. The pick up is very strong.  The only drawback is that it is a little more noisy than the other vacuum, but I can live with that.
