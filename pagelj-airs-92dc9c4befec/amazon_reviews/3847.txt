Best media "box" available. Here's what it does:
Lots of people have heard of the Apple TV (ATV) but they don't know the purpose it serves. First off, I'm an Apple user, I have macs, ipods, iphones, etc. Once you use an Apple product, you'll appreciate how well it interacts with other Apple products. This is the best part of the ATV. Best features:1. This allows you to play anything that's on your computer, in iTunes, on your TV or the sound system connected to your TV. This includes music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, etc.2. It offers media streaming, like Hulu, Netflix Flickr, YouTube and some other lesser known types. These are independent from iTunes and your computer, and they just use your wireless or wired internet connection. The interfaces for Netflix and Hulu are second to none. Once you try this, you'll never do XBMC or3. This makes airplay possible. This means that if an ATV is connected to your TV or home stereo (through the receiver connected to your TV), you can press one button on your iphone, and the music, movie, or show will be played on your TV and/or the speakers... wirelessly, as long as you are connected to your home's wi-fi network.4. Renting movies.. this is the best feature. Instead of leaving the house for a movie, just rent a standard def or HD movie from your couch for $3.99 for SD or $4.99 for HD. Sometimes they have movies that are still in theaters, and on a few occasions, they've had pre-theatrical releases. Apple TV doesn't have Pandora or Spotify. Why? Because Apple is making their own music streaming service, which will debut in coming months.
