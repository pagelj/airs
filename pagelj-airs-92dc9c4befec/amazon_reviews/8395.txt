Fake! Got a NB-5L badly reassembled to make it look like a NB-6L
Battery held together by a NB-6L label. There was a gap between two outer shells. (Real batteries usually have a more solid cover.) So I pulled off part of label & the whole thing came apart. Magnifying glass showed it labeled 5L, not 6L. So badly made that I couldn't reassemble. Threw in the trash. I have written only one other negative review on Amazon. But, since Amazon asked me to review just this one product, I felt obligated to respond. [Once during medical problems, the Cleveland Clinic called me for comment on one specific doctor out of the 10 who were evaluating me. The doc was shortly let go. But instead of reviewing him, I just changed to another doc.] Maybe I could have helped someone else by providing comment. I don't know if the battery I recieved would have worked or if it could damage chargers or expensive equipment. Got my backup 6L from Adorama cause my camera & printer came from them - battery looks & performs perfectly.
