It's a Battery!
I ordered this battery in May of 2007 from Amazon. com. I have been using it ever since. Recently, Amazon asked me to review this product and it is my pleasure to do so. First of all, it's a nice battery, and it comes in original Olympus packaging, unlike the cheap Chinese imitations which tend to explode, killing the operator. It also comes with a very detailed and hefty manual (for a battery). I didn't read the manual, mostly because I can't even begin to imagine why I would need to, but it must say a lot, I'm sure. Because the battery is genuine Olympus, you can expect that it will fit the camera perfectly, and it does! It slips right in, and then clicks with a satisfying 'click'. Once in, it supplies power to the camera until it is depleted. At that point, you have to remove the battery and charge it. Be sure you have a charger, otherwise it will be nearly impossible to charge it. Overall, this is an excellent battery in beautiful Olympus packaging and an incredibly thorough and detailed manual (I'm assuming).
