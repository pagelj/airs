Perfect Works Great
This Grill is perfect for Hamburgers, Bacon, eggs, and Pancakes it comes with a grease scraper which easily doubles as a mini spatula. Has a large grease tray that slides out and is easy to clean. I also like the price from Amazon I have seen this griddle priced as much at $70 more in some of the stores. The Griddle Plates are nice as I can remove them for cleaning, I also like the fact that I can order different Griddle plates should I decide to use it as a waffle iron. Great Value and Excellent Quality
