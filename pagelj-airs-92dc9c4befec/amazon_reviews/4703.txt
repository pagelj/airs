Best for Price
Amazing quality for the price.  This player is very user friendly and connects to your existing router automatically.  Easily surfs the web to access tv shows that you missed.  Reasonably simple to connect to movie providers such as netflix, hulu, amazon videos and others.  You have to go to your computer and set up your account with these providers, of course.  I would defiantly recommend this blu-ray player.
