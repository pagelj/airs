You just can't beat it for the price
Go to any store and shop for cheap ear buds. You will not find them at the price I paid. I bought two pairs.-They don't tangle badly like some others.-I'm no audiophile, but they sound great. Better than the older iPhone ear buds I was using-Soft and comfortable. Multiple sizes of plugs so they even fit my fiance's finicky ear holes-I got them for $6!!!!-I wear them at the gym and while mowing. I sweat. I sweat a good deal. No issues. Read some other reviews that said they break due to sweat. I'm not sure how it's humanly possible to sweat enough to ruin them if you're using them right. Some people use their buds all the time and are very sensitive to sound quality. I use them casually, maybe a few times a week for an hour or so. I love them and think they sound better than fine. If you're willing to pay more than $25 for a set, why not try these first? You'd only be out a few bucks if you didn't like them...
