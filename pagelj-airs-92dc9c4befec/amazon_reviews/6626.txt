Best Point & Shoot
First let me start out and tell you I am a photography novice. Purchased this camera from Amazon.  Arrived within a week..  Very easy to use. Started taking great pictures . One thing I noticed is that the automatic white balance with flash is out of whack.  Pictures have a decidedly reddish ting on flesh tones with the nikon sb400 speedlight flash. Started shooting flash pictures in programmed mode and set white balance to 5000 kelvin.  Red flesh tones go completly away. Very natural.  Color on this camera is very representantive of actual subject.  One minor annoyance, in the automatic mode, the camera does not always focus on the subject at hand.  In low contrast situations the camera has a tendancy to focus on objects other than the subject at hand.  In this case if you switch to center metering you will  be ok.  Please with this purchase.
