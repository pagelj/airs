I've owned this vacuum for 2 years.  It's still working great!  This is my second Eureka Upright Bagless Vacuum.  Face it, after a while, the plastic parts get tired.  But I came back for this one due to having two Yellow Labs, and the fact that this is an affordable unit. It really does a GREAT job of vacuuming up their hair and dander, and whatever all over the house.  Great on carpet.  Because it has no bag, I do have to clean the filter often.  I've found the easiest way for me is to use my husband's air compressor wand... outdoors, of course.  Otherwise, I'm not sure how I'd clean it as well. I did need to be resourceful when it came to the little plastic tang that helps hold the cord as you sweep.  That, predictably, broke off, but a plastic zip tie now holds that part of the cord to the upright part.  Also, the accessory hose nose gets placed in a little round ring on the side of the sweeper.  Over time that ring gets too large (it's plastic) and the accessory hose would constantly pop out of it.  I just made a 'bushing' out of a dryer softener sheet, and the hose stays put until I need to use it. I like that it's lightweight... of course it would be, it's nearly all plastic.  It has a light-alert on the head of it... if you sweep over too much thread or string, that light will come on.  Turn off the machine, unplug the cord from the wall, lay it over, and carefully remove whatever's on the beater roller.  Also, do not let the canister part get too full.  It will diminish the filter's suction, and possibly cause the machine to shut off until it's cleaned out and cooled down.  Do that once, and you'll remember.
