Very smooth video
My wife and I love this monitor. The video is excellent and far from what we expected from one of the cheapest monitors out there. The frame rate is very fast giving it a smooth fluid video playback. The battery isn't as good as I hoped so we keep it on our adapter dock most of the time. No problems with wifi. We upgraded our router recently so I wasn't expecting any problems anyway. If you are looking for a monitor on a tight budget and DO NOT want sound-only monitors, this is it.
