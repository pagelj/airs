This is the handiest thing we have for cleaning up spots around the house. It's so much more convenient than the full sized vacuum for cleaning up small spills and dirt. Just grab it and don't have to mess with the cables and dragging it around the house. It's well balanced and light. We bought one for our parents as well. Highly recommend it.
