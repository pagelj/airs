Like Butter!
These are fantastic for exactly what they are named for, cutting rag quilts. The spring loaded scissors are easy on your hands for repetitive snipping and short blades make a short clip so the stitching is not easliy cut into by accident. So sharp they cut like a hot knife through butter!
