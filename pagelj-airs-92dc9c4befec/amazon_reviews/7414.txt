I love this lens
After using a Nikon 70-210 AF lens for several years I was ready to move up to something better.  This lens is an upgrade in every way.  The AF-S is fast, quiet and accurate, and the VR is a godsend.  I took pictures inside an old church, where flash is not appropriate and would have ruined the photos if I had used it, and I was getting hand-held 1/4 second shots that were sharp.  I also got nice, sharp shots while on a whale watching cruise in moderate swells.  For the price you can't beat this lens.
