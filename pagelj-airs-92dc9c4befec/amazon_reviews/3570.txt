A Hugo worthy book if I ever read one
Old Man's War is sci-fi as it's meant to be and Scalzi may be one of the best modern science fictions authors I've read.  As the critic praise has commented already, this book reads like Heinlein come again. John Scalzi's writing style hooked me immidiately.  I began empathizing with his main character, John Perry, almost instantly.  He writes John (from the first person) in a way that expresses his emotion as well as his sarcasm, making him a very entertaining character.  By the time John enlists and joins up in the Colonial Defence Force, he meets other sarcastic characters like himself and the dialogue between them had be laughing out loud on numerous occasions. In Scalzi's universe, no one can join the CDF until they are 75, as they want experienced and knowlegable human beings rather than young and immature ones.  The book follows John and his band of self-designated "Old Farts" as they go to space for the first time, learn how they're going to be made young and battle-ready, head to combat training and then off to war with the numerous alien races who want to halt mankind's expansion into space.  Every one of these aspects is very well written and very entertaining.  The action scenes are fast-paced and intense and the scientific implications such as the Skip Drive are fascinating. For me this book invoked nearly every emotion, from laughter to excitement to sadness.  There may have been a couple of parts that I found a little hard to swallow (actually, the inch-tall alien race is the only one I can think of), but nothing worth dwelling over.  If you liked Heinlien's Starship Troopers, you may like this even more.  All respect to the classic sci-fi writer, but this book is more entertaining in almost every way.  Read it and enjoy.  I'm on to read Ghost Brigades.
