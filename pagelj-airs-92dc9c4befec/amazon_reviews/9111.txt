A Perfect Match
Just before our flight this Case Logic WDEC-10 case arrived on time.  The shipment was super fast and it arrived along with a DVD in perfect condition.  I purchased this case for my Sony FX980 portable DVD player and it fits perfectly, a perfect match.  There's enough space for all the player's accessories and some extra DVDs and CDs.  The quality is good and it looks really great.  Tried to install the case inside the car and it was done without any hard time.  It's just right for a long trip with children.  Thank you Amazon, one more 5 stars for you.
