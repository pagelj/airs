The product description clearly states this toaster specifications at 1400 Watts of power consumption. Turn the toaster over and the label clearly states 850 watts. Where did the other 550 Watts go? I was shopping for a faster toaster and the Watts of the unit should indicate the power consumption, the amount of resistance in the heating elements and, therefore, just how hot it gets. High Watts should mean more heat and faster toasting. I assume this is just another common toaster and I'll probably send it back to Amazon, unused, when the Christmas season is over. I'm disappointed that they have flawed specification on their web site. Had it been correctly described at 850 Watts I would not have ordered the toaster.
