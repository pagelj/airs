Great comfortable backpack (not for large laptops)
All in all I'm really satisfied with it, there are a couple of areas for improvement though.. And I think I got lucky with the laptop size thing :)The pros:1. The most comfortable backpack compared to 2 other backpacks I've used before, it always feels so light on my shoulders/back no matter how much I stuff in it.. And I'm generally a heavy packer2. Much more spacey than it looks... The middle compartment has enough room for about 2-3 books, it's completely separated from the laptop that sometimes I even put my lunchbox in it. Also, the laptop compartment itself has lots of extra room for cables, chargers, probably even books,papers, etc... The cons:1. Laptop sleeve is surprisingly small, fits 15.4" and smaller... It barely took my 15.6" Lenovo Y560 ... The laptop does fit, but it's not completely padded/shielded and the zipper barely closes. If the laptop were a quarter inch taller, it wouldn't have closed.2. The front pouch is very large and perfectly organized (with utility pockets, pen holders, etc...), but the opening is so small it's annoying. The zipper doesn't open wide enough for you to actually see what you're reaching for.
