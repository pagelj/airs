So happy with these - at first
I hope I don't change my mind six months from now, but right now I love these. They are harder than OEM cords but more flexible than some of the other cords I've gotten. The one I use in bed, I did put the pen spring on because I have a bad habit of shredding/bending/breaking cords by laying on them. This one has stood up to a couple of weeks of abuse so far. Glad I got the 2 pack. I have one in the den, one in my room, and my short OEM cord travels around the house to all the other rooms.***Update: One of them will trickle charge, but is useless to try to use the device while charging. The other still works perfectly. I guess it's just a crap shoot. Still... the chance of getting a good one at a lower price seems to be worth buying any of the others that are known to crap out.
