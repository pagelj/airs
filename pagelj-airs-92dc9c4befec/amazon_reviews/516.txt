I recommend this product to any parent needing to "watch" their child when in another room.
Rececieved this product ahead of schedule, which is very good, since it was during the "Christmas" period, when delivering things are very busy.  This product works as advertized and I recommend it to any parent needing a product to view their child whenever they are not inside the same room.
