Be Careful it may not work in your device
I am sure it will work in other devices, just not in mine. I have a digital camera that only will take a 2 GB scan disc. In the description it lists my camera but make sure before you purchase how large a scandisc your item will accept. I was able to return it after 20 or so emails and leaving negative feedback for the seller. I just wanted to exchange it... it was a tremendous hassle. So, I recommend Scan disc... just make sure you know your devices capacity before purchasing.
