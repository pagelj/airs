back to basics
When I was a boy I found a box of my uncle's books under my grandparents dresser. He was in the merchant Navy during WW11 and loved SciFi - especially of the 1st contact, military persuasion. Those books were part of my introduction to Heinlein, Van Vogt, Norton, and even HG Wells. I have been in love with them now for over 50 years so it has been exhilirating to see the genre reinvigorated. Marko Kloos "Terms of Enlistment" is a worthy successor: likeable heroes, interesting plot, and brisk, dramatic action. Even better, it is well written. I look forward to reading more from this author.
