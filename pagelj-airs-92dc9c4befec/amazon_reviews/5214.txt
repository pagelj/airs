Very Nice Set
I originally bought this cutting board set as a gift for my daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  There are three boards of different sizes.  They are well constructed and solid.  They have a smooth finish and nice rounded edges.  As they are made from bamboo they are an environmentally responsible product.  My wife likes them so well she wants me to get her a set now.
