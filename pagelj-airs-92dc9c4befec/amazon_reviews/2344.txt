Great and exciting read!
I always feel an emptiness in my soul when I finish a book, I no longer get to be part of their world, it's like losing a friend! I can always tell when I get this feeling, the book is/was good. This one was one of them! I read it in a day, I just couldn't put it down. The main character is stunning, witty, loveable, and surprising... I can not wait for the next book!
