Decent pictures, poor functionality
I received this camera as a gift.  I've used it for a year and finally given up on it.  If I bought it myself, the review might be a bit more harsh, but in reality, I would have likely returned it.  The photo quality is what you would expect from a 12 mp camera.  The zoom lens works well, build quality is good, hd videos turn out great, and the image stabilizer does its job.  I had grand expectation for this camera as it was an upgrade from my 6 year old 4 mp camera.  My grand expectations were gradually replaced by general disappointment.  I have four main problems with the camera:1.  lag time - the time between pictures is terrible.  It will often take 3-10 seconds to record the photo on the memory card before it's ready to shoot again.  I tried several memory cards, all high quality fast cards, and the problem persisted with all cards.  When you are using the flash, the lag time between shots gets even more ridiculous.  The flash takes forever to recharge.2.  user interface - the menus on this camera are very non-intuitive.  The scroll wheel navigating button is great.  However, the menu itself takes a long time to get used to.3.  auto mode - this is supposed to be a nice point and shoot camera - however to get a decent photo, I've had to manually adjust things like white balance and shutter speed.  I rarely get decent quick shots using auto.4.  battery life - this things eats regular alkalines for breakfast.  The convenience of a standard battery size is quickly outweighed by the cost of frequent replacement.  If you choose to spend a lot more $$ on the AA lithium ion batteries, you'll get a bit more life, but it's still a problem. Would I recommend this camera to a friend - no.
