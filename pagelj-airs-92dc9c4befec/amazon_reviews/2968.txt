Best thermos ever
I have used my thermos for a month now and it is great.  My ice stays for more than 12 hours and my water is as cold at 10:00pm as it was when I put in the first fill at 5:00am.  Adding water as needed and the ice just keeps on cooling.  The thermos is well constructed and rugged.  It is water tight as long as you do not fill above the full line.  Filling above the full line allows water to get past the seal in the cap and that water will leak out until you remove the lid and shake excess water from the lid.  If fill correctly it does not leak a drop and the lid push button makes it easy to open for a drink.  I carry this on my motorcycle in extreme heat I've used it in temps as high as 115 degrees and the water stays cold.  This is amazing becasue the outer shell of the thermos is very hot to the touch and the inner liquid is still cold.  All I can say is amazing insulation value the best I have ever seen and I've tried many. Update:I have now had this thermos for more than a year and it is still working great.  It only leaks if you over fill past the seal so care must be taken not to get water in the cap because it takes a little effort to remove all the water and it will drip on you until all the water is out of the lid.  If you don't fill past the fill point and take care not to get water in the lid it is water tight.  I did have a spring on the lid fail after 14 months of everyday use and after calling customer support the new lid arrived in less than a week.  I still recommend this thermos it performs as advertised.  It still looks new and has been droped many times without breaking.
