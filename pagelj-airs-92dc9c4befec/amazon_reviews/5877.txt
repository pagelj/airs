Great HDMI Cable, Very Reasonable Price!
It's easy to go wrong with cables when ordering inexpensive ones off the internet, but this one is a sure thing. I wanted to be sure it would support 3D for my Bluray and TV and it sure enough does! On top of that, this is a beefy cable. The thickness makes it feel like it's not cheap and going to work, and that is indeed the case. Great cable!
