When I first bought this vaccum, I was very impressed with how well the suction was and how easy it was to manuever. But now that I have had it for a year I absolutely hate it.  There are 2 screws at the base of the handle that hold the handle to the rest of the machine and those screws dont screw into anything, they fall out all the time and when they do its impossible to vacumm, you have to stop, push the screws back in and then continue till they fall out again. I do not reccomend at all. I have had multiple people look at the screws and try and secure them in without sucess. The suction of the vaccum has also decrease dramatically since I first bought it. And the tools dont stay in their storage areas well either, they fall out frequently.
