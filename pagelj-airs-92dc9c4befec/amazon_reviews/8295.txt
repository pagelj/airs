This diaper pail worked very well for me up to a point. I believe the size is just fine (it holds about 2-3 days' worth of dirty diapers). The foot lever works fine, opening the lid enough for me to put the dirty diaper in it without using my hands. I've read complaints of the lid not opening enough and the lid of the pail getting dirty as a result (maybe those reviewers got a defective product. Mine certainly opened more than 3 inches). I didn't have a problem with this, since I bundle up the dirty diaper in a tight wad before throwing it in (not to mention that this also further minimizes the stink). So, like I said, it worked very well for about a year. After that, I don't know what happened that it didn't contain the odor of stinky diapers anymore, not even for a day. So I started to dump the waste in the toilet first, then bundle up the diaper, then put it in a plastic bag, then in the diaper pail. Didn't work much. Then I tried doubling up on the plastic bags. Didn't work. (I also washed it about once a week, but it helps only marginally). It's as if the stink had completely permeated the hard plastic of the pail (I never used the pail without a plastic bag). It even stinks when it's empty! I might as well leave the diapers out in the open. So, after 1 and 1/2 years, I'm ready to get a different pail.
