Perfect case for the Canon S95
Just got this case based off of other reviews saying it's just right for the Canon PowerShot S95 and they couldn't be more right.  The camera fits in this case like a glove and gives the camera a good amount of protection.  The front pocket is roomy enough to carry a spare battery or additional SDHC cards.  This case is well with the price.
