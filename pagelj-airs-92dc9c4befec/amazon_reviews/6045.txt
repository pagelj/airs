Disappointing Christmas gift
I bought this for my husband for Christmas/new job present.  We were all very disappointed when we tried to open it and the clips were so cheap/poorly aligned that we couldn't even open the holder!  We are returning it, so we did not try to force it open or break it.  Definitely a waste of money and a disappointing Christmas gift.  Hope to find a belated, quality product elsewhere!
