Fun Toy
This little device is a fun "toy" to play with.  It's incredibly easy to get it up and running.  All you have to do is plug it in, attach it to your television with either an HDMI cable (you have to purchase one separately) or the included composite cable and enter the passwords for the sites you have memberships for.  After that, just click on what you want to watch and enjoy. The remote is very intuitive and will probably take you about 5 seconds to figure out and the interface is user friendly and easy to navigate. It also uses a radio signal, so "line-of-site" is not an issue and you can "hide" the box if you don't have a convenient place to attach it in plain view or you don't like the look.  The box is also very small, not much bigger than a deck of cards (though more square shaped), so if space is limited it's not a problem.
