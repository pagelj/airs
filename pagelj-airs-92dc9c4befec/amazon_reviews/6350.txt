Good camera, but have to send it back
Very good camera, a little bit small for my hands, but very light. It makes pretty good picture, no questions. Why only four stars? And why I want to return it... OK, there is a huge deal breaker for me - no FP mode. Yes, I know, it's totally my fault, I should read spec more carefully. I bought this camera in a single click after reading a general spec. I have the d90 and was interesting in more cropping ability, I don't care about video, I have a good camcorder, but I do need a better low light performance with higher ISO. My d90 is best camera ever, but I don't like to go with it above iso 400, even with ISO 400 noise is noticeable. I'm not a pro. I'm just taking pictures of my  18  months daughter, a lot of pictures, almost every day. I mostly do it at home and use sb-900 flash with various lenses. And now you probably understand why high synchronization speed is so crucial for me. The d3200 allows you to shoot with  flash using 1/200 exposure or higher (slower), it's definitely not enough for my high speed baby :-)Also, imaging you are shooting portrait against a sun, you have to use a fill flash and you also want to preserve thin DOF to get a nice blurry background, it is also impossible with d3200. About pictures quality - I didn't notice significant difference between d3200 and d90. My old and lovely d90 still very sharp. I've tried  Nikkor 50/1.8g and Sigma 17-50/2.8. In terms of sharpness and focus accuracy my 50 mm is doing better on d90, Sigma is my flagship for indoor shooting is doing pretty similar and very well on both bodies. I have not tried 18-200vr yet, I'm planning to try it over the next weekend. I also have a 60mm d macro and 105mm/f2 love to use them on d90, but they are both D and will not auto focus on d3200. The only gain that I see with using d3200 it's a much lower noise between ISO 400 and 1600 (compare to d90), but don't go higher. D3200 produces better colors and of course much more details (thanks to 24mp sensor). I didn't play with raw on d3200. Almost forgot, the face recognition is not that good compare to even some p&s, many times d3200 focus has been jumped between my daughter face and her toys, especially balls. I also like 3d tracking in my d90 much more, it's more accurate. The d3200 is not always can predict movement direction and set focus correct in 3d mode. So, I have pretty mixed feeling about d3200. It's a nice camera and could be a perfect walk around camera, this is a good and light backup camera, this is even nice prime camera if you don't use flash much as I do. But it doesn't work for me. Just one more feature and this camera could be a champion, but no FP HSS means no deal for me. Sorry Amazon, I'm really love your  30 days return policy, It's not my usual practice, but this time I have to return this little baby, it doesn't feet my needs. Bottom line: I would recommend this camera as a first slr camera to people who want to advance their photography experience and people who like to control their cameras settings. Good luck to all of you!
