I'm very critical with my vacs. And I am very impressed with this ones performance! Its a bit pricey but I didn't want to be dissapointed so after researching, this one seemed to be exactly what I wanted. I bought it with the understanding that it will supplement my regular corded upright, and I still think that is how one should view this vac. But after a week of using it (everyday), I haven't even needed to touch my regular vac. This Hoover Linx seems to be doing the job very well...... and with no cord its actually a PLEASURE to just grab it and use it. I now realize how much cord management makes vacuuming such a chore. Since it does NOT have a wand/hose attached to it, I will always have a need for my other corded heavy vac. And if theres a bigger job with a need for more power, I will choose the regular vac. But honestly the Hoover Lynx is performing well and so far I think the regular vac will be mostly sitting in my closet. My house is pretty small, has all hardwood floors (and a few area rugs) that need daily dust/dog hair maintenance. Filter hasn't gotten clogged  by pet hair yet. Battery lasts longer than I need it to. I tried hard to run the battery down to dead just to see how it reacts.... when the indicator was blinking (meaning almost out of juice) it still had full power, and I still had the time left to vac my entire small living room before FINALLY just shutting off with a fully depleted batt. VERY NICE. I'm familiar with LI-ION batteries, I use them for professional equipment. I would never want a cordless vac to use any lesser battery technology. Light weight, charges relatively quick, last a long time, keeps its full power till the end, and the batt will stay charged longer when not in use. Feel free to try another cordless that may cost a third of this price, but I have a feeling you get what you pay for. I could be wrong though, this is my first and only cordless vac purchase.
