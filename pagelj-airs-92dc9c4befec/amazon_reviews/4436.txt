Canon battery for XT
I was going to purchase a cheaper battery for my Canon XT, but after reading stories on how the generic batteries died after a few shots, I decided to purchase a Canon made battery. I am very pleased and after shooting a few hundred photos the battery is still going strong. I think it is worth the extra dollars to make sure the battery is there for you when you need it.
