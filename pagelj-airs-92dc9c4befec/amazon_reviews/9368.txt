Should you buy this ... YES you Should.
I had the opportunity to view this item in a Retail store but it was out of my budget.  When I decided to order another moniter, I came to Amazon.. out of curiosity I checked for this model on Amazon to see the price comparisons and compare the features.  Oh my goodness I got this one a superior model for what I would have spent in the retail store.  Great price and the unit is sleek, has a wonderful picture quality and watching my son (The father to be) playing in another room with the camera while my daughter in law (9 mos. pregnant) laughing in another part of the house with the handheld monitor while we watched the whole thing on the stationary monitor... It was worth it just for the laughs and memories.  LOVE this product.  5 STARS absolutely!!!
