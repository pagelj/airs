Just a couple of hundred pages into the book and am a little disappointed. So far not as enthused about this book as the first four. Partially due to a lot of backfill for some of the main characters. Martin does give fair warning of the format and content in the introduction. I'm going to keep at it and hope the story line progresses. Suspect this might be a lead-in to the "final" book.
