Just Right
I purchased this item because of it's small, compact size.  We use it in our RV and it fits perfectly on the counter and stows away easily in a cupboard when not in use.  It has most of the same features as larger toaster ovens and does a great job toasting bread, muffins or heating up a slice of pizza.  It is easy to clean.  I would recommend it for those looking for a compact size.
