Only charge 50%
I originally purchased this cable a few months ago and it looked like what was pictured. It worked perfectly until it top part fell apart , but it was $2.00 so i figured i'd get another one. This time it looked like the kind of cable you would get with your iPhone; looked more solidly built, however, it would only charge my phone 50%. Maybe iPhone knows, who knows.
