Anything ASUS makes is worth it.
I have two jobs. One at an online retailer warehouse and the other at an electronic repair shop. I repair PC's, Laptops, Tablets, Cell Phones, Gaming Consoles, remove viruses, clone HDDs, Data transfers, etc. Needless to say, I repair A LOT of laptops (anything from software issues to complete motherboard replacements). Out of all of the Laptops currently on the market, ASUS is the best. My top four, in order, are 4:Lenovo, 3: Toshiba Sats. (the new ones , NOT the old) 2: MSI 1:ASUS. The ASUS ROG series is excellent. The hardware is phenomenal and the BIOS is the best. This model is probably my favorite, because of the dual HDD/SSD config and you can even add a third SSD by removing the disc drive and using a 2.5" disc drive HDD tray, and USB an external disc drive. Out of the factory, it runs a little hot but they do have aftermarket copper cooling tube heatsinks for the CPU and GPU and AC5 or IC Diamond Thermal Compound will really help. Great for overclocking and dual OS booting.
