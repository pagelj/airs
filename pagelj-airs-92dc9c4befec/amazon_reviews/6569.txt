I have had this coffee maker a few weeks now and feel I know enough to write a review. first and foremost it makes good coffee and that's the most important thing in my mind.  Other reviewers noted some design concerns and I've found similar issues.- pouring water into the reservoir requires care to keep from spilling.  the design of where you pour the water combined with the shape of the coffee pot makes it a little too easy for minor spills/drips.  I found that I use my wife's water kettle as my pouring vessel and that works much better than the coffee pot.  since I'm not using the coffee pot to pour the water with I must watch the reservoir gauge that is a little inconveniently located.- the lid to the pot snaps on where as my old coffee pot had a hinged lid.  i really question whether this snap will last very long- coffee basket seems like it may be too small.  I don't make my coffee very strong and never put more than 7 tablespoons in the basket.  after brewing the grounds are pretty much up to the top of the basket and I wonder if I used more would they have overflowed the basket.  not a problem for me but might be a problem for otherspositive features- brews excellent coffee- programming is easy- love the brewing 1-4 cups extra hot water feature- brews quickly and produces hot coffee- warranty length greater than other brands
