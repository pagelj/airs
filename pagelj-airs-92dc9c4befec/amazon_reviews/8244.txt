Works as I'd expected,
I purchased this camera for use in photographing outdoor activities in which my camera would probably take some abuse, such as snowboarding, whitewater paddling, beaching, camping, et cetera. So far this camera works pretty well. It is my first Olympus. I also have a Canon T1i DSLR and a Canon SD450 point and shoot. This camera is basically gonna replace my SD450. I've used the program auto mode, as well as many of the scene modes. Program Auto seems to work very well. Most recently I was on travel/vacation and it was cloudy and overcast most of the trip. I wasn't sure if my photos would be any good because of the relatively flat lighting, but they seemed to come out relatively bright. The scene modes appeared to work as advertised, with the exception of the panorama/autostitch function. Based on some of the stitched outputs, it seems like the autostitch functionality is doing edge detection but only at a single point, and not necessarily the most defined or strong edge. The results were clearly way-misaligned panoramas. I'm gonna stick to using Canon's photostitch utlity on a PC.
