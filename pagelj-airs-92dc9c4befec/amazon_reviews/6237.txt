BEWARE
This camera does make wonderful video and stills. However, I have never heard of being able to TURN OFF audio when recording. Most people simply record with sound and MUTE the footage later or add music over it. Due to this ON/OFF feature, I someone recorded a VERY important and special event in total silence. I'm not sure how the sound was turned off???? I am so upset and in tears that I lost out on this event. I am really confused as to why anyone would want to record in a silent mode?  This feature should NOT exists (a safety feature) in order to prevent others from doing the same thing. I can never get the entire day's event back again. Thanks alot SONY!!!!
