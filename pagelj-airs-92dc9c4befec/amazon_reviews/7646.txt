It would get a 4 or even a 5 but....
This is a really great machine.  However, I am extremely disappointed that, at this point, it will not wake up after going to sleep without a long power button press followed by a short power button press.  Apparently, I'm not the only one who has issues with this.  At this point, the options are 1) wait for an update (Samsung can't tell me whether it is a hardware or software issue) or 2) send it back to them.  I don't have time for that.  It is amazing to me that they can't tell simply tell what the problem is because so many others have it. It will also not stream Netflix.  This is not that big of a deal to me.  It just doesn't make sense.
