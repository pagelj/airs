poor quality and missing a part
Watching videos to study before I attempted the repair and being pretty good with my hands, I still had to get a new phone.  I lost the battle.  The screw driver supplied lost its Phillips head  after the first turn so I had to go on a micro Phillips head hunt losing a good hour.  It was missing the pre-cut tape to secure the new glass so I had to order it separately which took days.  There was no guide.
