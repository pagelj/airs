Three Cheers For a Sweet CD
I absolutely ADORE 'Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.'  It's one of those rare CDs that you can simply listen to straight through and sing along to every song.  They're all incredible.  And Gerard's voice... it's so filled with raw, powerful emotion.  The songs are intense, fast-paced, and they just really make you want to get up and jump up and down or something! I also noticed something curious when I listened to the CD a few times... I find that in most CDs I buy, I grow bored with the single/s tracks because they're constantly aired on the radio or TV.  Not so with 'Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.'  The singles 'Helena' and 'I'm Not Okay (I Promise),' even though they are singles, are so amazing that I don't want to skip to the next song when they come up!  An absolutely, insanely incredible CD.  If you must pick one CD to buy the next time you go to a store, let this be that one. Favorite Tracks: 'Helena,' 'You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us in Prison,' 'I'm Not Okay (I Promise),' 'I Never Told You What I Do For a Living'
