I bought this coffee maker because the last coffee maker I bought that was carafe free went out  in one month.  This one cost considerably more but is well worth the extra money.  It is easy to use, makes great coffee and is easy to clean.  I also  love the full/empty gauge.  Very attractive coffee maker too.
