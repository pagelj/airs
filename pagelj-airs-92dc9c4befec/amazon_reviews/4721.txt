Do reviews on older products ever get read?
I am a slave to Amazon.  They prompted me to write this review.  I bought 4 of these cables to upgrade my component video distribution system (three TVs and a projections system) to HDMI.  The cables seem to be a good balance of flexibility (had to fish them through walls and rafters) and decent strain relief on the connectors.  They work OK for stereo audio, and I have not had a chance to test either the ethernet or 5.1 audio via these cable.  I have separate TOSLINK connections for digital audio on my projection system, only stereo audio through HDMI to the TVs.
