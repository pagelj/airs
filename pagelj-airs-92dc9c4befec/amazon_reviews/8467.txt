Excellent product for travel.
Ordered this for use in charging tablet computers during travel, particularly long airplane trips. Took quite a long time to charge up the unit, but I just left it plugged in overnight to get it fully charged.  Used it to charge an iPad 2 and it charged it close to a full charge. After recharging unit then used it to fully charge a Nexus 7 which had less than 10% charge. Have also used it without any problem to fully charge a Kindle Fire (first generation) tablet. Unit appears small enough to carry around and works great for what I wanted. Would highly recommend this product.
