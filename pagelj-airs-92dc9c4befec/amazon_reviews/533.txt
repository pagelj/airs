Great Story Telling - Part 2 (of three) is the most powerful
This was a creative and well produced miniseries. The use of location, props, makeup, etc. were well handled. The second part of the three parts is by far the most powerful and best story telling in the series. It could have been better as part three leaves you a little down with weak character resolutions, but the truth is that these situations are more real-life than fantastical and over dramatic. Very intelligent, realistic and well acted. Any fan of serious science fiction and story telling should give this a try because its great qualities by far make up for its detractors.
