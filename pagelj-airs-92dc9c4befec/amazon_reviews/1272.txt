Virgin Mobile equals bad phone service and dreadful customer relations
The phone worked well enough but the Virgin Mobile service is horrible.  The phone never worked in my home -- lack of signal and dropped calls made mostly to customer care.  I don't have a land line, so after 4 days I went back to T-Mobile.  Virgin Mobile would not give me a refund for any part of the month's "service."  The only time I ever saw all the bars light up on the phone was in the T-Mobile Store. Just be aware you are taking a real chance by using Virgin Mobile. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to return the phone and get a refund.
