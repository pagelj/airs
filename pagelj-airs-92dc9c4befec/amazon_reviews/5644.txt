Anker Battery Goodness
The Anker Astro E4 delivers the power and consistency that I need to keep consistent functionality across my devices.  I travel domestically every week, and the Anker keeps my iPhone / iPad product fully charged and ready for use.  While others in airports / hotels are seeking rare outlet spots, I can work from any location knowing that my devices are at the ready. The charging cycle (for both the base unit / peripherals) is rather quick and also without much heat buildup. On a side note, I had a fault charging cord and the Anker tech support shipped out a cord immediately, and followed up with daily emails, until I received the replacement... and also after the fact... to make sure I was satisfied with its performance.  This level of care is lacking in this disposable / non-contact type of world we live in. I recommend this product and have now just purchased the Astro 3 edition for local travel... and one for my friend as well. Keep the innovation flowing!
