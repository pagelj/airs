In my opinion, none of these toasters are worth the money. I'm feeling generous, so I gave it 4*. In truth, it makes toast just fine, but how long this one, or any other, will do it is anyones guess. I needed a toaster, this seemed worth a try. I'm getting real toast at this time. I will say this, I've had very good results with Oster products.3-Month Update: Still working and toasting just fine making real dark and light toast as desired.
