We used to have a similar product purchased at Ikea.  I was not impressed with that products durability or quality of materials.  Having sen Simple Human products at brick and mortar stores before, I was always impressed with their elegant design and materials quality.  That coupled with the reviews on this site I placed an order.  Coming up on one year, I could not be happier with its smooth sliding operation, quality construction, and sound design.  A definite buy.
