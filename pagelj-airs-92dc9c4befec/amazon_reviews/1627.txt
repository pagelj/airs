Quality product, Canon reliability
Not much to say about this cartridge, except it's easy to install, works from the outset, produces sharp/clear black printouts/copies, and lasts a decent amount of time without costing an arm and a leg.  Have been using Canon printers/cartridges for years, and the best recommendation is they work as advertised & trouble free!  Highly recommended.
