Easy to hook up and easy to use
I also have a Sony Blu-Ray with WiFi for streaming video.  The Sony works just fine, but the Roku retrieves much faster.  A difference of a minute or two might not sound like much, but none of us like to wait. Mine is hooked up to an older model TV -- no HDMI.  All I had to do to connect to the TV was put the red, white, and yellow cables (provided) into the red, white, and yellow inputs on the TV and plug the unit into an electrical outlet.  The Roku logo appeared on the screen, with clear and easy instructions to connect to Amazon, Netflix, Vudu, etc. I think this would be an excellent gift for an older person who's not tech savvy (like me).  The remote control device has just a few buttons and none of them get you into trouble if you don't press the right one.  Roku asks for a credit card number for purchases, but you will set up a PIN for purchases.  This means there's no worry about accidentally buying something. My only disappointment isn't Roku's fault.  I'd like to have HBOGO but my cable company doesn't offer it, so I can't get it, even though I'm an HBO subscriber.
