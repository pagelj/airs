This is the best non-permanent mount I have used.  I normally have a rigid permanent mount from ProClips installed on my dash, but sometimes want a travel one or to hold a second device.  This mount will hold any iphone in any style of case (it snaps in to grab your phone when you click it into the mount, quite clever and very versatile).  If you are worried that the bottom bracket will block your power cord access or your headset jack (for iPhone 5, with it on the bottom), it will not.  It won't block access to any iPhone.  If it did, however, you could simply loosen the one part, spin it 180, and have those holder brackets from the picture be at the top.  It grips solidly and your phone would not slip out.  The rubberized pads on the side brackets that slide in when you mount it will hold nicely.  The mount articulates into just about any position quite nicely, and you can easily do landscape or portrait modes. Best of all?  That strange silicon suction cup they advertise as mounting to the dash?  It WORKS.  Lets say it works on SOME dashes.  You need a spot that is not too bent or curved for it to stick, and some dash surfaces still won't let it stick, but my main vehicle will (honda, it didn't stick in the Mazda). This is a great portable mount.  I think it would really hold nearly any phone on the market, and you can move it between vehicles easily and change it to suit your preference.
