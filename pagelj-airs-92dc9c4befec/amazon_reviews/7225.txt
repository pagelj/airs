LOVE IT!
I've had mine a few weeks now and get constant compliments.  I bought the dove brown which is a very light shade.  It's more of a cool color than a warm color.  I wanted a BIG purse and this was exactly what I wanted it to be.  I don't know how long it will last since I'm still in the honeymoon stage but I can honestly say even if it broke right now I'd find a way to fix it and still be content with my purchase.
