Best cordless I've ever used, incl. answering machine features
I won't repeat all the features people have commented on. The reasons I like this better than my past Panasonics, Sonys, and Unidens are:1. Long distance from base station for quality sound. This may simply because it's my first DECT 6 phone, however.2  Answering machine call screening doesn't force me to listen each time to my outgoing message.3. I can EASILY screen, retrieve, and erase messages from any handset.4. A host of subtly clever details that make this easier to use. It's hard to list them because they seem to crop up unexpectedly. One tries to do something and notices it seemed easier than I'd have expected. I have only one minor criticism. On the handsets, the Speaker and Flash buttons (white on black) stand out visually much more than the more important Talk and Off buttons (green and dark red on black). In a dark or dim room, even with the backlighting it's harder to find Talk and Off buttons than it should be. It would help if they were larger or otherwise more readily distinguishable. I have not tried the bluetooth feature with a cell phone. It's not something useful to me.2/24/12: I continue to find this a great cordless phone. I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a two-line phone in this line. Their current two-line DECT phone is sorely lacking in many of the new features I and others like with this phone.
