I have had this coffeemaker for about 2 months.  It's working fine and I rather enjoy having the percolater type maker back again.  Perhaps its a blast from the past memory.  It makes just coffee just as good as the automatic makers.  I don't use any special coffees. I just use the regular coffee but its still good.
