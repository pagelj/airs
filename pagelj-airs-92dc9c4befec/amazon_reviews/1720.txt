Can't beat this camera for the price
I have taken various types of photos with auto settings and manual setting changes. In my opinion this camera cannot be beat at this price. We have a Fujifilm Finepix SRL that was 3 times the cost and I would put them on the same performance level. I know GE is not known for cameras, but this one should put them on the map.
