The Aerobie makes a rich, flavorful cup of coffee w/o bitterness or grittiness.  Now my nitpicks.  First, it uses a lot of grounds.  You could probably get a similarly good cup of coffee with a simple Melitta filter system if you used twice as much coffee grounds as usual and didn't let the water contact the grounds for more than a minute.  Second, the Aerobie claims to make up to four cups, but actually makes at most two modest-sized cups.  When I have a friend over, I usually have to interrupt the conversation to make a second batch.  Third, it can be hard to push the piston down when making a purported four-cup batch.  (Actually, I don't push down.  I rest my hands and chin on top and let my body weight do most of the work.  Yes, I know I look silly.)  Fourth, the Aerobie is slighly more complicated than a regular filter system.  For example, after you make the coffee, you have to add some hot water to dilute it.  How much hot water to add may involve some guesswork.  Nevertheless, I've had the Aerobe for two years and I intend to keep it.  A great cup of coffee is one of the little pleasures of life, and the Aerobie delivers.
