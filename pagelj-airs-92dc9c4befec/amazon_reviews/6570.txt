Just what I needed
I am not a pro but carry my Nikon D40 all over for impromptu shots.  The SB-400 is small enough to carry around and does exactly what I want when I need a flash.  I am not into HEAVY so the camera and flash must be lightweight and provide the technology for exceptional shots.  I recommended this flash for all the reasons above and no negatives.  Jimmy 6000
