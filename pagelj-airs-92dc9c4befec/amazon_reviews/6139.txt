Good Deal, Great Price!
I bought 2 of these to go with a roof mount DVD player I installed in my Grand Caravan a few weeks ago. Sadly, the DVD player sound is crackly and just plain awful when you play it through the radio, so I am super glad I did!!!! These headphones sound much clearer and all I did was pop them out of the wrapper, install the included batteries & push the power button. WA-LA.... instant happy DVD watching kids in the back seat! I will say that these do have good sound for the price. They aren't the most comfortable headphones you can buy but you certainly will not feel like you wasted your money (given you spent so little in the first place). After 2 weeks my 4 yr old sat on them and the plastic broke where the earpiece rotates. So, this is the part where I state the obvious, they are plastic. Don't store them on the seats & your kids wont sit on them. They have that cheap like foam that covers the earpieces. If your kids like to tear that stuff off, then you may want to spend the extra money on something without it. All of that said, I bought 3 more to replace the broken one and to have a set for extra riders. Most of these headphones are $30 a piece and I just bought 3 for that price. They aren't 5 star headphones, but you aren't paying for that either :)  If you don't want to blow a ridiculous amount of $$, but want decent quality headphones that do the job, these are for you!!!
