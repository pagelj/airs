Works well but a little deceptive
My father bought this as a suggested add-on to the Amazon Kindle - and I suspect a lot of other customers but this product the same sort of way. What they don't tell you is that you need to buy two things - the power adapter AND an "iGo Power Tip for Amazon Kindle". With the extra cost ($12) we felt we were both deceived and cheated. Particularly because the picture for the iGo Autopower power adapter includes a picture of the Power Tip (not actually included). But we were determined to make it all work and after an extra trip to an electronics store it now does. Overall I was impressed by the product but beware of what you are really getting.
