Disappointed
I searched thru a ton of cameras options looking for three specific features: a self-timer, AA batteries, and an AV cable to plug directly in to a TV.  This was going to be a gift and these were the three key features the receiver of the gift wanted.  This one was one of the few that claimed to have all three. Despite saying it did..... THIS DOES NOT COME WITH AV CABLES!!  USB cables - yes.  AV cables - no!  I ended up making a separate purchase for the AV cables rather than wasting time trying to fight with the seller.  Imagine my disappointment when the gift was opened in front of me to find no AV cables!!
