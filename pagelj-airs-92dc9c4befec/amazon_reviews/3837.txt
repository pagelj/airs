Stays where you put it!
Got this for my iPhone 4/4S. I chose a spot on the windshield of my truck to mount it. Stuck the mount onto windshield and it has been there since. There is no easy removal! I'm concerned if really pry on it to get it off the windshield, it may break the mount. The mount works well for my iphone4 in an otter box defender case. It stays in the cradle even when I'm driving some pretty tough off road. You can put your phone in the cradle and remove it easily with one hand. I'd give this 5 stars if it were easier to remove and move from vehicle to vehicle.
