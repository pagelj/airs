Love this toaster!
I've never bought an expensive toaster before and now that I've owned one, I'll never go cheap again!  It has great features like Lift and Look, which brings your toast up for a peak, then takes it back down for further toasting.  Instead of springing up when it's done and scaring you half to death, it slowly lifts up the toast, then politely gives a beep to let you know it's ready.
