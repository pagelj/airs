dmp-bdt220
recieved product and everything looked good. I did a firmware upgrade and started testing it. Blueray and 3d blueray played just find the only thing i had trouble with was connection to my network to play music or movies i have. The only way i got that to work was with solftware i got from internet and now everything works like it should. One of the best buy i'v done on amazon.
