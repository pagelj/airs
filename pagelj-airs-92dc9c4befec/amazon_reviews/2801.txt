Great player for the price
Pros:-Easy to use-Brilliant picture-Netflix app with dedicated button on the remote-Panasonic app market-VIERA Connect if you have other Panasonic devices-Wireless capabilitiesCons:-DLNA leaves a lot to be desired on file types it will play-Netflix app is great, but wish it had more categories like Apple TVUnknown:-3D capabilities, I don't have 3D TVSummary:This is a great blu ray player, especially if you have other Panasonic devices - they work very well together. I love the netflix app and the dedicated button on the remote, but was disappointed with the DLNA capabilities. Great buy for the internet video watcher and blu-ray watcher!
