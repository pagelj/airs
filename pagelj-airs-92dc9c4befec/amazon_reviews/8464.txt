AWESOME READ!
This book captivates the imagination from the very first page!  I kept reading and reading, I couldn't put it down!  (Totally drained the battery on my IPad!) The characters are so distinctly ingrained in my mind, I think about them like they are old friends. I can't wait to read the next book!  Thanks for creating such a great story!
