best roku yet
I have been using Roku for years now. I had the original Roku and I got Roku 2 last year. This Roku was to replace my original Roku since I noticed a serious lag time in hulu streaming on the original Roku (the picture will freeze, sound will continue or sometimes both picture and sound will freeze. This happened almost every time I tried watching something on hulu). This is by far the most responsive Roku out of the three I owned- the lag time is minimal. Channels are brought up within matter of seconds. Also, no more freezing for hulu at all. The quality of the picture is excellent. I'm not an expert by any means when it comes to these things but yesterday I watched a Polish movie from the criterion collection on hulu and it was such a pleasure- I paused a couple of times during the movie and it had no difficulties picking up instantly where I left off. There was absolutely no lagging and the picture quality was amazing for streaming. If you have all the main movie/streaming channels which I do (amazon, roku, hbo and netflix) I think Roku is your best bet, especially if space is an issue (I use this in my bedroom and there's not enough room for a dvd player). Lastly, the headphone jack on the remote is a brilliant idea. I have neighbors and I'm conscious of playing my tv loud especially at night. You can fit any headphones (I haven't even tried the roku headphones provided since I like my Bose ones so much) and watch as loud as you want without worrying you're disturbing your neighbors. Now if only Max Go had a Roku channel...
