Top Ten Sci-Fi for a reason
I am somewhat ashamed that it has taken me so long to read this classic of science fiction. It's one of those books that if you have been reading SF for any length of time you have heard of and knowing about its premise you simply lump it into Heinlein's Starship Troopers category or even worse with some of the newer fiction by Scalzi and others. Written with a wry insiders humor that is very genuine and enjoyable, it follows a young brilliant man as he is indoctrinated into a new type of warfare and can only accept his fate as relativistically everything he once knew during his life is destroyed by the flow of time. Although I don't think this book is ground breaking from the stand point of any particular premise or even how it imagines the future of war might look like, it is ground breaking in the way it forces the reader to consider how war, regardless of our objective viewpoint, has such a devastating effect on those who wage it. From this viewpoint of how fragile life and living becomes and how ephemeral everything else that we cling to actually is (and I do mean everything) the core of the story at the end is about the one thing that is intrinsically rare and can be shared even in a place that shouldn't foster it to begin with. If you haven't read this classic because you already think you know the premise and couldn't possibly wade through the same thing again, I ask you to reconsider. Forever War is a classic that deserves every praise lobbed its way.
