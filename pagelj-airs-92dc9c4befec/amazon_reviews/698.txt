Love it!
My daughter and I are both very happy with this purchase! It looks exactly as it does online in person. My daughter is nearing 2 and I made this purchase for an airplane trip coming up and since I also have a 3 month old daughter i figured it would be more functional for her to have her own bag for her toys rather than cramming everything into a diaper bag and backpack. The size is perfect and she loves it! I also ordered this item with expedited shipping and got it on the day expected!
