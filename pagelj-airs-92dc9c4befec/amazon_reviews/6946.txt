My wife researched a replacement for our 20yr old Krups and this is what she found as the best bang for the buck given our current income level.... My biggest problem is that it took most of a year (we only use it on Sunday mornings) to figure out the foaming technique for this machine:1. Low fat milk in a 1 Cup Pyrex pitcher2. Place in freezer for 10+ minutes3. Start brewing4. When the espresso reaches the top line, start frothing by moving the Pyrex UP AND DOWN as well as around.  You'll hear the different sounds and learn how to use the sounds to manage the level of foam.5. Turn off6. Make your Latte's7. Unplug unit and wipe down frother8. After a year - watch frother tip break off and you start reading reviews for another brand. Expresso anyone?
