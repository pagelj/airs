Overall a solid read
I'll admit, it starts a little slow, even though there's a ton of information thrown at you right away.  Maybe that slow feeling for me comes from the information overload as the storyline begins.  There's obviously a well-thought-out universe behind the scenes, and it can be a struggle to present just enough of that but not too much.  As the book settles in though the storyline starts rolling and it gets better and better.  By the end the characters are familiar and the plot twists are easier to follow. Perfect book?  Honestly, no, I've read better.  Great read and worth the time?  Yes, definitely!
