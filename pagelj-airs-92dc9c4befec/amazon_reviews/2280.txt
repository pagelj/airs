I have this model and the 32000 rpm, 13.8 capacity model as well and both are just amazing.  I purchased both directly from the LA website. I was surprised - This model was bigger than I expected.  It is much bigger than it looks in the picture.  Please read and understand the directions BEFORE you attempt to use it. It is the best thing invented to compliment laundry washed by hand or by a small appliance washer.  It's a must have... Drying is so much faster as it expels so much of the water from the washed items! I found the company extremely accommodating with super fast shipping.  Thanks Omar at Laundry Alternative for your help and great customer service!
