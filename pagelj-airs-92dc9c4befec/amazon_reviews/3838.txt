Quality HDMI Cable for Cheap
I bought this cable for my new Sony LED TV. I'm a value shopper, but I was not looking to skimp on a cable for my new TV. I ordered this on a Thursday night and it arrived in the mail on Saturday morning. Thank you Amazon Prime, this service is super fast and your yet to fail me. Back to the product:The Good:Solid construction, feels like a sturdy cable, gold plated connectors, length was just about rightThe Bad:Nothing that I've found as of yet. Overall, I would recommend this cable, it does its job and is inexpensive.
