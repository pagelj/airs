quick question
this isnt a review its more of a question. i really hate how verizon now has the manditory data package and i really want this phone and im PRAYING it doesnt require one. before i waste my energy and call customer service or drive down to the Verizon store. can anyone please tell me if this phone requires one? Thankyou so much
