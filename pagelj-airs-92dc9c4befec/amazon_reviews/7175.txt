I bought this vacuum as a replacement to my old one. I didn't want to spend much but I really wanted power and after doing my research I noticed that the stand-up bagged vacuums were still the ones with the most suction. At first I didn't expect much out of this inexpensive vacuum, BOY WAS I WRONG! This machine has plenty of power and that doesn't go away by adding the extra tools it has. This vacuum is a steal for its powerful punch. Buy this, you WONT regret it!
