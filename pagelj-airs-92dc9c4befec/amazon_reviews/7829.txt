Goodbye Microwave... Hello Breville!
We decided to pursue this oven after my wife and I decided we wanted to keep our cooking as "natural" as possible, or radiating our foods as little as possible. This purchase made sense. We wanted an oven that was versatile enough for everyday cooking, reheating and toasting, occupied little kitchen counter space, and used less energy than the regular oven. The Smart oven meets all of our needs. The preset settings are AMAZINGLY convenient and spot on for the temperature - haven't had a burnt toast yet. The reheat function heats up a regular size dinner plate to the point where it is warm, not hot (acceptable for me). If you like your meal hot or warmer, then you can adjust the temperature to what you like to get the result you want. We baked cookies which turned out excellent. The outside of the oven gets quite hot, but we decide to use that to soften butter when we want to toast our bread. It fits most of our 9"x11" casserole dishes, so we will use this more often than our full size oven. The baking non-stick surface is truly non-stick and easy to clean with hot soapy water. I'm looking forward to baking our first homemade pizza in a few weeks. The price was right. We chose NOT to buy the warranty given the number of reviews that showed high reliability ratings from past users. We intend to use this for at least 5 years, or until Breville come ups with a SMARTER convection oven that will not only cook/reheat food, but also tell you how bad your cooking is.... In a nutshell - invest in the oven. Make the purchase - you will not regret it!
