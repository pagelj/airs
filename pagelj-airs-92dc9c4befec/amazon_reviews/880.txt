Big disappointment.
Dropped my good Nikon camera and was out of a camera until I got another one or got mine repaired. Thought it would be a good idea to get a small, portable, all around camera, that can be taken anywhere and that fits in your pocket, and that I could also use in the meantime. I liked it because it still has an optical viewfinder, and also has 16 MegaPixels.  Not so, ... Big disappointment. The "Optical Viewfinder" does zoom in and out as you use the zoom, but the image you get is totally OFF from the image you saw and took a picture off.  So, ... the Optical Viewfinder is absolutely NO GOOD !!! The regular images and pictures you take, even some in broad daylight, are completely grainy and very "noisy", as well as also a bit unsharp. You can't blow up any pictures to anything bigger than maybe an 8 x 10 or even think about using a cropped image to enlarge it. You see this right on the computer screen. Also, there is a control button for the Flash, but only to turn it OFF or to turn it on AUTO, ... NO way to turn it to ALWAYS ON, like if you want to use it as a fill flash or in backlit situations. It is a small and cute camera, but if you want any halfway decent results, get something else. I ended up returning it after just a few test shots. I still don't understand why they even bothered to put 16 MP into a camera that gives you worse results than any of the older 2 or 3 MP cameras, or even my Phone Camera.
