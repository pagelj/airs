A little bit of a let down
Initially, I thought the car mount was perfect. It attached to the windshield easily (and admittedly hasn't fallen once) and simply gripped my phone so I could use it as a GPS. But now, I've only used it a few time, and the pads on the clips have unevenly compressed, so my phone starts to lean and falls out. On top of that, the mechanism to turn it has lost its grip so it will tilt sideways and won't click back to level. I'm disappointed.
