Delilah's Diary: A Sexy Journey
A spilled cup of coffee is all it took to cause Delilah's old life to crumble around her feet. She's found her husband in bed with the pastor's wife and then discovers she wasn't the only one. She's spurred into action, leaving it all behind as she takes a much needed journey of self discovery. A whole new look, a new wardrobe, and some friendly advice has Delilah exploring all that she's never had before. This was a great read! I loved Delilah, the small town, Christian good girl who grabs the opportunity to leave her safe, boring life behind. Some of this bordered on a little TOO innocent to be believed though; I mean, how can you be twenty-nine and know nothing at all about bisexuality or masturbation? However, despite her over-the-top sheltered personality and massive insecurity issues, Delilah was still completely endearing. I adored her and I really enjoyed this story. Just so you know, the ending is a cliffhanger and it really was disappointing not to have a resolution to what Delilah decided to do with the situation she was in. P. S I really loved the author's shout out to Locks of Love, what a great charitable mention!
