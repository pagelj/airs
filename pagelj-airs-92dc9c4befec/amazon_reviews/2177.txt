Excellent camera for the money
I've been playing with this camera for the past few days and at first is very disappointing when you take night pics or' pic of the moon. but once you get to learn how to use the Manual Mode and adjust the Aperture and the shutter speed and you can take some great shots I was even able to take a nice shot of the Big Dipper an it came out clear no distortion at all. I love this camera, I just wish I could remove the lens to adapt it to my scope, but other than that it's a great camera for the money. Also another thing that I like which I thought was a thing of the past is that I can use regular AA batteries in case of emergency,I got this camera as a combo and it came with rechargebles batteries and a charger. I would recommend this camera to friends an families.
