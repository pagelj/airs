Poor Image Quality, Inconsistent Exposure, Overpriced
I purchased this camera as replacement for my Olympus 770SW-- which by the way, performed very well.  The Stylus Tough 8010, however, produces inferior photos.  Even when using the flash indoors, the resulting photos tend to come out underexposed-- even after using the exposure compensation.  I took five photos on a tripod with the same composition with both fill flash on and with auto flash on.  In all instances the flash fired but the exposure for the photos varied.  There obivously is a pre-flash built in the camera and this may be causing the camera to misread/miscalculate exposure. Also, indoors under incandescent lighting, if you use auto White Balance any white has a blue tint.  If you use the incandescent setting for WB, EVERYTHING COMES OUT AN UNNATURAL BLUE. It seems that the trend for camera companies is to add impressive features, gimmicks, etc. aimed at the novice photographer rather than focusing on actual image quality.
