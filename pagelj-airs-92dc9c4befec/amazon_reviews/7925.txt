Phenomenal sound quality and easy to use!
Way exceeded expected sound quality!  I am a court reporter and have used it to take hearings and depositions, and it is perfect.  Only negative is it does so much it was kind of overwhelming at first getting started, but once i read the manual, it was easy to use, plus the olympus tech support is phenomenal!  Would highly recommend.
