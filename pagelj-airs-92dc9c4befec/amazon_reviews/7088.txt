Why not divide the reviews?
This is a review of Amazon's choice to bundle reviews for the regular Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries (2000mAh) with the reviews for the Sanyo XX Battery Powered by eneloop, 2500mAh High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries (2500mAh).  This makes no sense and gets 1 star.  If I'm trying to decide between the two products, how do I benefit from looking at the same reviews for two completely different batteries?  I gave 5 stars to the batteries so as not to hurt the rating of either product. I use an LED flashlight for long periods (up to 7-8 hrs. per night) for commercial fishing work annually in the Spring, and any degradation of the light beam will be detrimental to the efficiency of the work.  (Ideally no change of batteries would be necessary.  Can usually use 1 set of 6 disposables per night for this task, but what a waste!)  I'm trying to figure out which batteries are the best option.  (and am hoping that a rechargeable Ni-MH will outperform a disposable battery)Just thought I'd make this comment.  The reviews should be separated between the products!
