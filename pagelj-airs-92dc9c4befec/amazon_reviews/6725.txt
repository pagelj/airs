Not bad for the price
Charging this product to full capacity was not possible until about a few dozen discharge/recharge cycles. And then it takes over 6 hrs of full sunlight to complete. Afterwards, it was able to fully charge an iPhone to 100%, but then to only 30% a second time soon after... Kept it in a waterproof clear passport container (Cabelas)attached to a backpack during travel.
