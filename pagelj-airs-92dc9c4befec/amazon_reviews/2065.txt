Not usable
So this stuck to the windshield fine at first but it does not have enough structure and my phone shook so much it was distracting while I drove.  Forget trying to look at a GPS and see what is going on.  Then as I tried to figure out ways to make it more stable, it just stopped sticking to the windshield altogether.  I cleaned the suction cup and the windshield but no better.  I realized there is a reason this product is so cheap.
