Works Perfectly
Why pay $80 for an HDMI cable? At the price, I figured why not try it. I have it hooked up to an upscaling DVD player going to a 46" LCD. Since it is digital, the worst that could happen is it is DOA, dies soon, or starts artifacting. So far, so good. Clear picture with no artifacts and after 2 months it is still going.
