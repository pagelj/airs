Perfect!
My wife bought me the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite for my 42nd birthday after I commented one night how reading from my Kindle Fire was starting to hurt my eyes when I read at night (because I am getting old!).  It was the perfect gift... something I wanted but did not want to buy because I already had the Kindle Fire!  Because I travel a lot, I needed a protective cover.  I looked at the less expensive models but decided to purchase the Amazon Leather Cover since it was a custom fit. The cover arrived after two days and my new Kindle Paperwhite fit snug inside.  I like the magnetic cover off/on feature.  I am happy I chose this cover, even if it was a bit pricey.  I believe it is a worthy investment!  PLUS... it looks really cool having "Kindle" on the metal clasp!
