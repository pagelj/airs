I had my tempo little  almost two months.  I seen to be a very powerful vacuum for the money I spend.  It a little louder than the one I had before. It picks up so well that you have to buy bags more often. A package of three bags-brand name was $5.50 - $6.50-estimated.  I will be looking in the future for off-brand bags for a better price.  Thus far I like my tempo.
