For the longest time I went back and forth between the t3i and nikon 5100. I chose canon because my friend has the t1i and I was already used to the menu setting and button layout. I love the swivel screen! I own an etsy shop, so it's going to be easier from now on to take pictures of myself with my items! Picture is soo clear! The only thing that I don't like is that when you enter the live mode, you can't see the focus points like how I'm used to with the T1i. I bought this when they had the promotion of the all the rebates with the extra lens, filter and printer. I got all that with taxes for under 900 bucks! Can't beat a deal like that!
