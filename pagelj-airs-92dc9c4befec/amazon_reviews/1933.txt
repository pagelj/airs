Great phone
First I'll say that this is my first smart phone, but I'm comfortable with the learning curve on new technology, so I didn't have any trouble learning the basics.  This was also a change of service vendor for me, so some things are different depending on which company's setup you have.  Probably the "basic" feature that threw me off the most was realizing that voice mail was an app, rather than having to call a phone number to retrieve messages.  I love the size of the phone, which is a hot topic in the reviews.  Evidently you either love the size or you don't care for it; I love it.  There are so many great reviews from people who can compare this to other smart phone models, so I'll just end by saying that if you want a bigger screen and (back in the day) could program your VCR, you will love this phone.  Plus, you can always ask a 10 year old to help you.  Enjoy!
