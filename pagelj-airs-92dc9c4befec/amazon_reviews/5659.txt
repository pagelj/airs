Nice backpack for the price.
This backpack is really very nice and useful for the price paid. It fits my 17" HP laptop very nicely and is well padded. Its professional looking and comfortable to wear. There is plenty of room for other stuff like notebooks, pens, ipod and other type of items. Very happy with this purchase.
