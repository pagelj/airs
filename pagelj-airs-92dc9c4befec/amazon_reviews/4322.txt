It works well.
I purchased this for my Samsung Galaxy Note II before taking a trip to D. C. It provided sufficient storage for all of my photos and videos, while not otherwise impacting the performance of my phone. I also love that apps that require a lot of storage, like Real Racing 3, appear to be loading their large files onto the card, leaving more space on my phone's precious internal memory.
