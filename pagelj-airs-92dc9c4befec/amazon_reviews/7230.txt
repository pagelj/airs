great camera
This is a great camera....... I purchased a Nikon L110 during a black friday sale and was only about 50% happy with it...... sold it and wanted to go back to a Canon but did not want to spent all the money on a Rebel......... this camera is the big bang for the buck.  Takes excellent pics everywhere.... from outdoors to low light inside. The zoom is nothing short of amazing!! I will love this camera for many years to come.
