I didn't mean to order silver color, I just wanted to order some plastic utensils for the office and these were nicer/shinier than I expected - almost look like real metal silverwear.  I kind of prefer the cheap white plastic ones, cause I don't feel guilty for throwing them away after one use.  These are more solid and feel like they can be used for more than 1 use - which, at the office without a dishwasher and just a bathroom sink - I didn't really like washing my forks and knives there - so I wanted something to throw away.  These are higher quality than your average set and it's a nice product.
