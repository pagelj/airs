Misleading at best
Let me state that I am a huge fan of the book series the Dresden Files.  I think that they are brilliantly written and wonderful.  I expected something similar to the books in the show and found it was not there.  It would have been nice to know that this TV series was based on the books, and only loosely at best.  Paul Blackthorne, although a good actor, does not carry the persona of Harry Dresden, it just doesn't work.  Second, I'm sorry but Murphy is described as being a petite blond warrior, not a somewhat tall, petulant, brunette.  I was also looking forward to seeing Mouse.  The other continuity issues I had were Harry's apartment being completely wrong, the blue bettle being missing, and Bob.  If you are a huge fan of the books, please don't buy this item, its really not worth it.
