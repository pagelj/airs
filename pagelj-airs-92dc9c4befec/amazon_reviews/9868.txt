Awesome product in a great price range!
I abosolutely love my new 50mm. Aside from getting use to a fixed lens I have no set backs with it. The weight of the lens is very light but it does not feel "cheap" to me. The clarity of my shots are amazing. I can really see the difference between this lens and my kit lens. I use this lens mainly for portrait work and love it. I would recommend it, especially for this reasonable price... you won't be disappointed!
