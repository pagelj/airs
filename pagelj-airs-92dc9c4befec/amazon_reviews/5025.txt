this is a must have for any pc
this come out of the box and rocks. plug and play. quick disc read. no lag. for the price of 25 or less i think ill order 2 more of these... may as well run four... never no when i need four disc at once.(never) but the look makes my pc feel like it was hit with the allspark. no longer will i have to scratch my game cd s by switching them out. leave them in and i can ping pong from disc to disc with no delay. great buy.
