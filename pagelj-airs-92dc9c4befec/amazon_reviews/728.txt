Does exactly what it says it will
I'm not sure what people are expecting from a $13 item but this is better than any stofen or plastic cap. It diffuses the light real well and installs easily. I had no issues with the velcro at all. Combine this guy with an off shoe flash cord and you can do some wonderful things. Excellent item for the price and a quick solution for the photographer on the move. Recommended.
