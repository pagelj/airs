Unbearably Tedious
Five years for this? Long drawn out characterizations that numb the mind. Plots dragged out with no resolution.  Who edited this novel?  I listened to the Audible edition and was appalled by the narrator. He had every female character sounding like an old crone. Waste ofan Audible credit.
