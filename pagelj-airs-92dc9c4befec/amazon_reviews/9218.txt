Screws the screen look
The moment I put this thing on my phone, the awesomeness of the Galaxy S3 screen was lost in a second.. It looks like crap! The mindblowing resolution it initially had now looks like its a cheap color display from the 1990s, and the matte finish is useless. Please dont even think of buying this product.
