SquareTrade Warranties
In April 2008, I won an auction on Ebay for a used Dell laptop. SquareTrade Warranties offered me the chance to buy an extended warranty for this laptop.  I thought "why not", just in case the laptop malfunctioned down the road.  So, I bought an extended warranty for 2 years. Well, last month, that laptop's screen started messing up by flickering and shutting off at times.  I went to [...], checked on my warranty status, put in a claim, and within 3 days I had my answer.  SquareTrade furnished the return shipping label (paid), and I boxed up the laptop and sent it in to them. Within a week of SquareTrade's receipt of the laptop, I received an email that the laptop did indeed qualify for a refund, and I received a refund of my purchase price that I paid on ebay.  That money was then sent to my PayPal account. What a smooth operation this was.  I will ALWAYS buy my extended warranties through SquareTrade.  They have proven to me that they stand behind their warranties.  They are a top-notch company! Nancy Nellis
