Hate this phone! Worst phone I've ever had!
I've been having problems with this phone for the past 2 years. I had to get it replaced but had to fork over 100 dollars in order to do so. Even then the stupid thing doesn't work properly. It blacks out the screen when I'm trying to end a call. It will randomly shut off, it also won't charge properly now. All I want to do with it is throw it in the ocean. I hate this thing! Never ever trusting an HTC phone ever again. Please don't waste your money or time on a phone like this. You will regret it.
