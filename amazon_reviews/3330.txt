Don't get the Kindle edition!
This is a wonderful book--5 star content--but the tables and diagrams are essential to its usability.  The Kindle version ruins it by providing low-resolution images that become unreadable if you try to enlarge them even just to their original size. Buyers need to know the Kindle version is vastly inferior to the physical book.  Amazon graciously allows a reversal of a Kindle purchase within 7 days.  We reversed our purchase within the hour, but had we not immediately gone through the Kindle version and recognized the problem, we'd have wasted our money.  Don't waste yours.
