an entertaining Si-Fi flick . . . . with a caveat.
I enjoyed this movie. As with most movies that are forced to keep their length to around 90 minutes the character and plot development is limited to at least some degree as it is in this movie. I found the reactions of his "friends" to his claim of being a Cro-Magnon man the most believable aspect of this film. I find that some if not many people's reactions to challenges to very strongly held beliefs can be very extreme, even violent as demonstrated in this movie. Most of this movie concentrates on his "friends" and how they react. However, one cannot ignore the challenges to science, philosophy and religion. I would judge the challenges made to science, philosophy and religion in this film to be of the most superficial nature and at the worst a serious flaw in the plot development. This is where the film become misleading and stereotypic. For this former Cro-Magnon man to claim he was Christ and Budda, takes this film beyond being just "possible." And the theology to which he ascribes to Christ is so obviously an unsophisticated appeal to the commonplace misunderstanding of what is plainly taught in the Bible to anyone who has read the New Testament with an open mind, that it makes a mockery of his character, thereby lessening the characters believability. I would caution any viewer of this movie to not take seriously any philosophy that might be derived from it, or even find any satisfaction that any of a viewers preconceptions are validated. This movie is pure fiction, or perhaps fantasy, with absolutely no basis that I know of in any of the sciences or philosophies of the world.
