don't use on old leather
I used it on a very nice boots, and it caused several stains. My guess is that it should be used on new leather in which all leather is healthy. my boots looked nice but using this caused the parts of the leather that are worn out to show themselves. probably because those parts absorbs this conditioner differently. I also used it on another boots which had a light gray leather and it made it darker, so far the color has not gone back to normal, and it's been 3 days. overall I think it would be a nice conditioner only on new leather to prevent future damage.
