Definetly Heavy Duty
The APDAM2B TV mount arrived promptly from the vendor, Cheetah Mounts. It is a heavy duty mount and it is well constructed. As mentioned in other reviews, the operation is stiff, but easily rectified by adjusting the torque on the hinge bolts. It is probably heavier duty than I need for the 40 inch LCD TV, but the price was right. The double hinge feature definetly gives it good strength for bigger sets.
