Disappointed!
I have used Tech Armor before and was extremely satisfied. Got a 3 pack for my iPhone 5. Went to our one on tonight and all 3 protectors didn't have the second tab to peel away after installation. I couldn't get it to peel off by hand so just gave up. Going to look around for ones with both tabs. Giving 2 stars only because I have enjoyed their products in the past.
