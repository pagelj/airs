Great Cinderella Story
I loved this story and everything in it. Marie Force has a great talent for drawing you into the pages and making you feel like you have a front row seat.  I read some of the reviews saying that it was a fantasy, and maybe it's just me, but I'll never understand how someone can pick up a FICTION book and knock it for being unrealistic. The story was well crafted and the characters were well developed. I'll definitely be buying other books in the series. Great job Ms. Force!
