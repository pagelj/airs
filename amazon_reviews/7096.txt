We bought this for texting and calling.  We don't use it as a smartphone, so can't rate if for apps and net access.  One nice feature is we can surf the net while connected to the wifi even without a data plan.  One bad point is contacts didn't transfer from sim card because it was an unlocked phone instead of a tmobile phone.
