Super Value
Read quite a few reviews on this lens.  So many stated the lens construction was not up to par-that it broke with repeated use---well it all depends how you treat it.  I treat this lens just as I do my more expensive ones.  So far, I have nothing but good to say about it.  I do a lot of photos at gymnastic events where flash is TABOO.  This little " piece of plastic " performs VERY well.  Would recommend to anyone wanting an affordable lens with beautiful results.
