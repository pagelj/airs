I thought this unit would work well based on the reviews I read.  However, I found that the coffee warmer hardware boils the brewed coffee right away.  This gives the coffee a burned taste.  Also, the  regular filters required for this coffee maker are too large for the basket.  I brewed coffee four times.  Two of those times the filter collapsed which resulted in tasteless coffee.  One has to trim each filter to let the spout to swing over the grounds without causing the filter to collapse.  I returned this item.
