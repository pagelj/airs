The coffee maker arrived in great shape on time packaged well. Instructions are good. Now the bad; the water filter's holder (which must be used) is poorly designed of cheap plastic. It has an inept opening system which broke on the first opening. This is a product flaw and even if it opens for you now will break at one of the 60 pot (average change rate) water filter exchanges. Making your coffee maker a useless piece of junk. Get another model or brand in my opinion without the water filter.
