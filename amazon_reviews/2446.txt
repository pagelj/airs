Excellent Laptop
This laptop has performed exactly as advertised.  The only hitch was that I transferred my files and programs from my old computer wirelessly and then had trouble installing programs like Roxio Move Maker.  I had to reset the computer to factory settings and then the installation went smoothly.  Would caution anyone about transferring files wirelessly, especially from a computer that was not functioning well.
