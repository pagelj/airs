Great laptop stand
This stand is sturdy and attractive. Although it is not adjustable, it holds the laptop at the right height and allows the screen to be placed for best viewing. I have used both a 15.6 inch laptop and a 10.1 inch tablet/keyboard combo with this stand and they both fit well and are held in place with no worries about tipping over or falling off.
