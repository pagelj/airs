Love it!!
It is perfect, fits like a glove on my iPhone 4. I love the color its dark blue, but it has a lighter blue, which I love. Some people had bad reviews b/c of the color, but its very bright and it is what I suspected. So if you don't want a bright blue then I would get other color. This product shipped on time and so far there are no problems with my otter box. Its definitely worth the price, but its nice saving a couple of dollars getting it through amazon then otter's direct website.
