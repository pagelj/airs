Stopped working after 1 month
First, this DVD player died after only a month.  But even when I was using it, I have to say it has the worst remote control ever!  You have to get it pointed at exactly the right angle, then push the buttons really hard.  There is no button to just fastforward or rewind - the buttons skip by chapter.  Now, if you hold down the skip chapter buttons, it will turn to ff, but choosing your speed of ff is hit or miss - a nanosecond too long, and you're back to playing.  As for the 90 day warranty, you have to pay shipping to them and back - it would be more expensive than the unit itself cost.
