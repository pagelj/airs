I wasn't expecting a great deal and got what I was expecting.  I am a french press user but occasionally I want less than the full 17 oz the press makes, and trying to make half a pot in a french press is rather iffy.  This maker provides a 1-mug capacity and with a permanent filter (no paper filter) makes almost as good a mug of coffee as the french press, but not quite.  This maker is also one of the very few that make coffee truly hot enough.  But you pay for convenience.  Using french press grind, the water does not stay in contact with the coffee very long, even on the bold cycle (which supposedly slows down the water flow but I couldn't tell any difference), so I fill the scoop to the max line or even above for one 10 oz mug.  That way I get the good oily mud at the bottom of the mug, which is what I was after.  For those complaining about weak coffee and are too tight-wadded to use more, you can buy paper filter discs which will slow the drip process and provide stronger coffee by leaving the water in contact with the coffee longer.  That however would defeat my purpose because the paper filter will also filter out the mud.
