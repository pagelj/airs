Great camera
At first, i wasn't very impressed with it. We bought it for a wedding. At wedding the pics looked dull and dark. But when we saw them in computer, we were amazed and delighted. Though none of the point and shoot camera can withstand the quality of a D-SLR, this one can be used for outdoor photography and recreational photography. My friend has a Nikon (don't know the model) which looks similar to this one. And man! this camera can match the quality of Nikon. this one looks like a d-slr. that way you can satisfy yourself as if you are carrying a d-slr. it's good for parties (not in dark light), picnic etc. bottom line is, this is a great buy. It's worth every penny.
