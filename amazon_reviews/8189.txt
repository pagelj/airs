American Quality
I received this set as a present and they are superb. My first impression was they had to be very expensive as they sparkle with a mirror finish and excellent attention to detail. The knives are very sharp with a good feel in your hand and easily slice through the hardest task. If you order a set as a present I would urge you to order a set for yourself also, they are that good. This set is deserving of the highest rating Amazon allows in reviews and it is so refreshing to see American made quality at an affordable price.
