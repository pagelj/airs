Good All-round Guide On General Photography Techniques
The Digital Photography is targeted at both the beginner and intermediate photographer. It contains about 200 tips on how to make you photos look like the pros'. It is a 218-page book with each tip occupying a page (plus a few pages of ads placed unintrusively at the back of the book). Each tip is accompanied by a high quality picture. There are over 120 tips related directly to shooting:Flowers (11 tips)Weddings (21 tips)Landscapes (29 tips)Sports (17 tips)People (14 tips)Urban Shooting (16 tips)General Tips/"Recipes" (14 tips/recipes)The rest of the book are primarily tips on equipment (e. g. lenses, tripods, cable release), operating your equipment (e. g. ISO, exposure, tripoding), post-processing (e. g. sharpening, RAW processing, organizing), printing (e. g. print size, paper choice, color profiles), and other topics of interests (e. g. selling your photos as "stock", monitor calibration, megapixels). The Digital Photography serves as a book that offers a solid, all-round view of general photography techniques. You can benefit from this book even if you're into a particular niche, such as landscape photography. As an intermediate photographer, I already know many of the tips and tricks covered in the book, so I feel the book is perhaps best suited for a person who is just starting to venture into the world of SLR photography. With that said, I did learn some very helpful techniques from the book. I also found many helpful tips for taking more creative shots. All in all, I'd recommend this book for both the beginner and intermediate photographer.
