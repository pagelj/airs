Gave as a gift received many hugs and thank yous for it.  They love having coffee already done in the mornings and having a two way, either single or 12 cup maker.  Added feature, it turns itself off after two hours, just in case your on your way to work, and remember you forgot to turn it off. They are very pleased and so am I.
