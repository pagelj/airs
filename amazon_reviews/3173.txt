This is not our first of this particular Brewstation. This will be our third. The first was faulty and had to be replaced. We contacted Hamilton Beach and they replaced it at no cost to us. They were very quick in doing so. We notified them by phone and two days later we had a brand new Brewstation. We had that one for many years until deciding to replace it not because it no longer worked but because it had started looking so beat up and worn from so much use. This one replaced the old one. We like that this Brewstation has the choice of brewing such as mild or bold. It also has a digital clock and timer so it can be set to come on whenever you like. It is nice to get up to smell of coffee brewing. Not having to deal with pouring from a regular coffee pot is great. No more chance of broken glass or spilled coffee. One thing to remember, when pouring the water into the brewstation do not pour too fast. There is a lip on the container for pouring. If you pour past or over that the water will run down the front much like trying to pour water from some types of glassware.
