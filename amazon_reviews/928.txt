Get ready for a heap of frustration!
The camera works properly but the software CD is defective. I ordered 4 cameras and the cd was defective for all of them.  It does not download correctly which  does not allow the camera to use all the features it  supposedly has.  The camera website does not have a download that corrects this problem. Also, what downloads  available on the site are in Chinese and are not functional.  The installation instructions are useless because they are not complete enough for different problems one might experience during installation.  It took me many hours of frustration to get the cameras to work.  There is NO customer service! You just leave a phone message and no one will get back to you.  Good luck!
