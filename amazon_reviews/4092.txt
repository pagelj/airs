lives up to the hype thankfully
If Avatar DIDN'T live up to the hype... I'd want my 2 and a half hours back, haha. A visually impressive presentation with an adventurous and intriguing storyline just about sums up Avatar. It's a notch better than, say, Jurassic Park for instance. Sure, Avatar isn't focused around dinosaurs, but it does implement the adventurous aspect a tad better in my opinion. No boredom *anywhere* in Avatar, and a much much MUCH heavier attention to action and adventure. That makes it better than Jurassic Park. Avatar is just a wonderful film with only a *little* bit of coarse language, so it's basically appropriate for any age. They do say the "sh" word occasionally though, so be alert for that when watching the film with the youngsters.
