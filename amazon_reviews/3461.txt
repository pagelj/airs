My wife and I have been married for almost 5 years and in that time, I have purchased her 3 other vacuum cleaners.  They were either too heavy, doesn't have good vacuum, or hard to emptied without making a mess.  I bite the bullet and bought her this one hoping to hit gold.  I did!  What we love about this vacuum cleaner: light, quiet, great suction, easy replacement of bag and our absolutely favorite feature is the chord winds itself up automatically with a press of a button.  What makes this vacuum cleaner a winner with my wife is that I actually don't mind using it. She says that it is the best vacuum cleaner EVER!  I have to agree....
