DO NOT BUY!!
I waited until we saw how these were going to work. THEY ARE TERRIBLE!! At first they worked pretty good. We bought 5. After a week one cord went out, so you are thinking like anything one bad cord. Then another went out. Now 2 of the others charge very slow and will only charge at about 60%. These are junk. I should have listened to the reviews, but I didn't. Buyer be warned.
