Great phone!
I was a little anxious about getting this phone. The reviews seemed somewhat mixed. I've been using an iPhone 4 for the last year, and was downgrading because virgin mobile is so much cheaper. I am impressed. The screen is brighter and more colorful than my iPhone appears. The camera is a bit better on the iPhone, I think, but I have a DSLR and rarely use my cell phone camera. The slant at the bottom of the screen worried me before I got the phone. But it is very natural feeling, I think I like the slant better than if it weren't there. Neither service nor the phone has lagged for me, and it is all pretty fast. When I first got the phone, it was a bit frustrating to get used to it (I've used iPod touches and iPhones for about 4 years now). But after reading the manual I think I've got it customized the way that I want it. The only thing I didn't like about the phone is that it didn't come with a swiping keyboard (which I thought was so cool about androids). However, there are several apps for free in the app store which will create a good swiping keyboard (the one I downloaded is called 'Swype.')I love this phone, and I hope that I continue to love it!
