Giant Purse... Fits Everything
This bag is a perfect size to carry around my Ipad, however it is a little big for me. I still use it since I can fit my Ipad inside. I am finding that the leather is already peeling which upsets me because I've only had the bag for a month or so. It's the perfect bag if you're into big purses and have enough to store in them.
