Well Worth it
I have found this to be an amazing product for home use to streaming photos, movies, music throughout the house.  But my pleasent suprise came when I started using it for business use in keynote or powerpoint presentations wirelessley from my ipad, or even iphone. Super easy set-up and mobility.
