a fantastic, fun read
I just stayed up way too late reading this book, and I have no regrets.  The stories come in perfect, bite-sized pieces, even though I couldn't put it down after starting the first one.  The plot and writing are both excellent, and I related to the characters.  The only thought I had after turning the last page was, More Please!
