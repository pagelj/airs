Motorola RAZR V3
Phone was listed as U. S. Version with warranty. Phone received was from Germany, obviously used or refurbished with a third party warranty. Phone did not have U. S. set up, but eventually worked well. Sound quality is mediocre at best. Phone was full of German text messages and voice mail somehow takes one to a German voice mail center. Originally a Cingular phone, it works fine with a T-Mobile SIM. Not exactly what we thought we would be getting.
