Impressive
I had been concerned about protecting the touch screen on my Kindle but wanted something that was easy to install.  This fit the bill exactly.  It snaps instantly into place and there are no bubbles or ripples to worry about.  I detected no change in the quality of the video display or the touch screen sensitivity after installing it. It also helps reduce glare so it's easier for me to read outside or while riding in the car.  I have had it installed on my Kindle Fire for several weeks now and have had no issues with it at all.  It has stayed in place and worked exactly as it's supposed to. I can now allow my young nephews to play games or watch videos without worrying about their little sticky fingers all over the screen.  The screen protector comes with a soft cleaning cloth which works beautifully to wipe away any smudges they leave behind.  I really think that anyone who invests in a wonderful product like a Kindle Fire would do well to invest just a bit more for this screen protector.
