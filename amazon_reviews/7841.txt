Good lens
Lens arrived before promised -- same day as my camera, a Sony Alpha A65 (also reviewed.)  Used both at a local state park to get some nice shots with contrasting colors and blending colors.  Spring is not quite here yet.  Pictures taken were great.  Only issue I had was trying the auto focus on a close up of some of the last berries on a branch.  I switched to manual focus and got a good photo, with the background appropriately blurred for a macro close up.  I also caught geese flying off the marsh, as well as great contrast with greening plants under water. Price was right and lens worked great!
