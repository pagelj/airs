Received and Empty Envelope
I received an envelope with screen application instructions printed on the outside - and a reference to a YouTube video showing how to apply to the screen protector. That was a nice touch. I eagerly, yet carefully, opened the envelope. It was empty. Fortunately it was also inexpensive. Based on the other reviews, it looks as if my experience was an exception. Good luck to all who order it.
