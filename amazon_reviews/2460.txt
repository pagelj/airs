Perfect for my dad, not really for me
My dad is happy with this, it lets him watch netflix on our dumb tv, and it makes things easier if I want to watch a movie from a harddrive, I can do that too. I mean its alright, there's nothing technically wrong with the product, but its overall a somewhat lackluster experience. The menu's have noticeable lag, and there are no animations to make things visually more appealing. I saw the announcement for the newest roku the other day and the menus look really nice, but I can almost guarantee that I'll never see it because this is an older version. It's good at what it does, but for the price I would expect more. It was the best product as of 1 or 2 years ago, but this particular one probably isnt now.
