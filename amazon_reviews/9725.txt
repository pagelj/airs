Crap!!!!
This item took around 3 weeks to arrive to my home, I took it to class twice for only a 2 hour period where it sat on the ground. I had it on my back and walking with it for maybe 20 mins total the two times i used it. It already has a tear and is falling apart. the only thing you can carry in it is maybe a wallet. crap crap crap, do not buy this.
