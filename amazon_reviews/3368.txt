Good mask... filter not so much
The mask is in new condition as promised. Fits well looks awesome. Seals well even with my beard. The filter is sketchy. It is labeled in Russian with no clear indication of the age of the filter. I'm going to put pics on the Internet to get an idea... but still a little suspect if I needed it in an emergency.
