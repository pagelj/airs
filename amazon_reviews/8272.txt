I previously had a self-propelled Hoover windtunnel that had been highly rated.  It was so heavy and awkward on stairs.  This Tempo Widepath is a dream come true.  Very light, easy to handle, and excellent suction power.  I had read reviews that the hose was flimsy.  I agree, but it does work fine.  The hose from my old Hoover fit this one perfectly, so I switched them and I couldn't be happier.  This $80 vacuum is really unbeatable for the price.  I would have paid a lot more for this versatile machine!
