Quirky coming of age story
I've really enjoyed reading the story of how Jacob Portman searches for his roots, and finds something he didn't expect at all. The book is written with charm and humor. I love the cover, and it evokes the spirit of the book quite well. The photographs throughout the book are an interesting addition, and they look good even on a Kindle.
