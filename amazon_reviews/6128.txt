I enjoyed it more than The Hunger Games
Before I start I should mention that this review is coming from the opinion of a 29 year old woman. I just finished the 2nd book and I am loving the story! I actually like it more than the Hunger Games. I feel that the relationship between the two characters in Divergent is not cheesy and unrealistic like that of Catnis' and Peta's. It was more natural/realistic. Like the way two young people (interested in each other) sleeping next to each other for long periods of time would really act. I also got bored with Hunger Games at times because there was not enough action for me. It was so dramatic; so much emotion. Divergent has a great combination of emotion and action/violence to keep the story moving. This book was also somewhat of a pysclogical thriller. So if you like lots of action mixed with drama, violence, and even some sexiness then you will enjoy this read. (Of course this is all wrapped up in a book for teens, so done expect too much out of it! Ha!)
