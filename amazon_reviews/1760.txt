At work, I must clean carpeted stairs, carpeted floor and hard floors. The large heavy upright provided was dangerous to use on the stairs. For weeks I swept the stairs down with a broom. This was not ideal either. I saw the Dirt Devil SD20000RED Stick Vacuum Cleaner in Target. I bought it right away. I am pleased to say it picks up just as well as the bigger unit. I am also less likely to fall. I am buying another one to use at home. Dirt Devil SD20000RED Versa Power All-in-One Stick Vacuum Cleaner
