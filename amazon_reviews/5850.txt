Hand Carpal Syndrome
So I'm not a doctor or in the medical field in any way. This game gives me one of the worst hand cramps ever. I'm not even passed the 2nd level and already I'm frustrated beyond replaying in the next 2 weeks. The whole problem is a combination of the PSP's awkward positioning of the Joystick and the fact that this game does not let us change the controls. Plus it required 4 buttons to be pressed simultaneously to dodge (R1+L1+X+Joystick), and you'd have to do that ALOT. You can imagine the pain your hand has to go through to do all that. However, this game is rated as the 2nd best game of the psp. So, if you dont mind the hand cramps, or are a HUGE action or God of War fan, this game is highly recommended (and i KNOW americans love God of War). WARNING - this game does have some over 18 years of age material.
