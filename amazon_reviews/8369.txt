When I opened the package, I was disappointed, as the vacuum sweeper looked like a child's toy. It is the bright yellow as pictured and a very lightweight plastic. I almost returned it without trying it out. Fortunately I didn't. When I assembled it and tried it out, I was pleasantly surprised that it really does work quite well for a lightweight vacuum. I have hardwood floors and two cats and a bad back, so I need something I can use at least daily. I was replacing a BISSELL 3106A Featherweight Lightweight Vacuum (the plastic parts broke off and it literally fell apart), and I would have to say after two months of use, it is much better. It is lighter, easier to use, works better on the pieces of carpet I have, and is less noisy.
