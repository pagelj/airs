The gratest lens in the world
I bought the lens 2 years ago, on Christmas Sales, since then  I never got disappointed. I'm not a professional , just crazy armature and my photos are not always so sharp, but still, even then, the lenses are GREAT help to improve the qualityI recommend this to everyone who have money to spend on it.
