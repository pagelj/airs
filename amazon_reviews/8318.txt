Has a problem
Bought the Toshiba DR430 to replace my Sony that stopped working.  The Unit records fine, however when I try to watch the recorded shows with my Toshiba DVD player on my Toshiba Television which are in another room, The Menue will not display.  Even when the Top Menu is pressed on my remote.  The bottom line is that there is no wat to tell what is recorded on the disk and thus select the program desired. The Top Menu works fine when the disk is in the DR430, but that unit is not where I want to watch the programs recorded. Think twice before buying this product.  My Sony DVD recorder is off to the repair shop.
