ASUS G75VW-DS71 : Best Configured Laptop I Ever Owned.
Returned Unit ( see bottom of review for details )Just purchased the most powerful laptop I've ever owned. I configured it personally. I want to thank everone in advance for their posts and reviews because they were very informative and influential in my decision on what to get and what to avoid.1) Upgraded CPU for added performance, plan to keep laptop 2-3 years.2) Upgraded NIC to Intel 6235 because there are so many complaints about Atheros range.3) Wanted couple SSDs but they're a bit pricey, needed storage space and I'll upgrade later.4) Wanted 3D version but it's matted & cannot be configured with significantly brighter screen.5) Wanted GTX670, was told I wouldn't notice difference if not gamer. Kepler is newer technology.6) Wanted 32GB since I'll be using VMWare to run many OSs & Graphic Rendering. Plan to keep 2-3 years. If none of the items I mentioned above are needed or the configuration below is overkill then go with the base model ASUS G75VW-AS71 for $1,499.99, it's less than half of what I configured and Amazon is one the best, if not the best online retailers ( excellent prices, customer services & reviews )... I really wrestled with getting the base model now for ~1500 and get another one a year later when newer technology comes out. However, I'll probably keep the configuration below for 2-3 years, unless something seriously significant comes out that I cannot upgrade on my system below. HDD's, Memory, ( CPU & GPU ? ) can be upgraded.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ASUS G75VW-DS71 Gaming Laptop - Highly Configured17.3' Full HD (1920x1080) 90% NTSC Color Gamut Glossy LED Backlit LCD (AUO B173HW01 V4)ASUS 30 Day Zero Bright Dot GuaranteeNVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M 128bit w/2GB GDDR5 (Kepler)Intel' Core' i7-3820QM (2.7~3.7GHz) w/8M L3 Cache - 4 Cores - 8 ThreadsIC Diamond applied to CPU + GPU32GB (4x8GB) DDR3/1600 Dual Channel Memory750GB SATA III 6GB/s 7,200 RPM Hard Drive - Seagate XT NCQ Hybrid w/8GB SSD750GB SATA III 6GB/s 7,200 RPM Hard Drive - Seagate XT NCQ Hybrid w/8GB SSDRAID DisabledBlu-Ray Reader/8x Super Multi Combo Dual Layer DVD +/-R/RW CD-R/RW Drive3-in-1 card reader ( SDXC/ MS/ MMC)Intel' Centrino' Advanced-N 6235 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi + Bluetooth' 4.0+HS Combo Card (Dual Band)Smart Li-ion Battery 8-CellSmart Li-ion Battery 8-CellWindows 7 Ultimate - 64-Bit Pre-installed w/ASUS Clean Install DVD + Drivers & Utilities CDFull Range Auto Switching AC AdapterASUS Gaming MouseASUS Gaming BackpackGlobal Two Year Warranty + 1 Year ADP + 24/7 ASUS Support~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Sad to say, unit is being returned, it doesn't work with 32GB.1) system boots ok2) no blue screen of death3) windows 7 Ultimate recognizes 32GB4) vendor called me and said there were problems with 32GB5) so i returned unit6) G74sx systems worked with 32GB7) G75vw systems appear to have problems with 32GB~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I'm not going to say anything negative about Asus G75vw systems, they are great. I simply needed 32GB of fast ram ( 1600Mhz ) in my system, plus I feel I get a lotof extras including 3 year accidental protection and normal use warranty for sameprice. That said I purchased an Alienware M18x.  It does everything I can imagine, plus awhole lot more.  You can use it as a HDMI input device ( display ) too...
