I purchased this model at a flea market, unopened in its original box. I got it at a "Deep Discount". I am always a little concerned about buying electronics, with no recourse, if it is defective, even if it is a "Bargain".  I just started using it last week, after my old one failed, after many years of use. Not A Oster. I am very pleased, so far, with this brand and model. It's very easy to use and heats foods quickly and evenly. My only little complaint, is that the display is not as bright in a lit room, as my old unit. A very minor problem, the function of the unit, of course, is more important. Easily 4+ stars, so far.
