Great design for the price.
In a brick n' mortar store these type of mounts cost $250 to $350! Easy install, just find two wall studs. Holds the tv and really can point the screen to the sides very well, and gives easy access to the back of the tv. Only drawbacks were the mounting holes for the wall could have been more, I had to drill more to catch my second stud but easy enough for a capable person. Also the center bolts on the armature are not easy to adjust as you need thinwall sockets, but mine moves ok. I'm glad I bought this and worked out the minor snags and saved HUNDREDS! (Literally). ps: Don't use their winky-dink level, use a real one to mark a level line on the wall.
