I have had this vacuum before and for it's wight and size it does a great job.  You always want to get the extra battery so you don't run out in the middle of cleaning. Always clean the filter after each use. You will be amazed at all the dirt it picks up. The filter is tight fitting and the handle is a weak spot but I love it. No cord and so easy to use.  LW
