These are substanial forged knives. And delivered in very sharp condition. After years of getting by with a cheap set of stamped steel knives, we decided to upgrade. And we're very pleased by our initial experiences with this Chicago Cutlery set. I can't speak to long term durability as we've only been using these for about a week. Do shop around when ready to buy. Different sellers carry these. Amazon pricing allowed us to buy the 18 piece set for well under what most retailers wanted for a 16 piece set in this series.
