Screen broke within a month!
I bought this camera at a bestbuy in new york city while I was on vacation because my other camera (CANON G12) broke.  I was able to use this camera just fine for 2 weeks while I was on vacation, but when I got home, something must've happened because the LCD screen turned off and started blacking out in the middle of the screen. It was the weirdest thing, but I was just very disappointed in the craftmanship in this camera. I'm glad it was within the 30 days so I was able to get a full refund. But for a $300 camera I feel like this shouldn't have happened, I didn't even drop it, I only used it for 2 weeks!!
