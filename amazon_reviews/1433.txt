Mountek MT5000 CD Slot Mount
Finally, someone has made a cell phone/GPS mount that actually works without flopping around, having to take your dash apart to intall, require that 3M tape that holds for about 30 days,or drill nasty holes in your dashboard.  Simple, good quality, nice ease of use.  The only thing that might be the least irritating is that the mounting screw is a little bit long, sticks out, and could be considered unsightly by some.  Also, if you are constantly changing CD's in your dash stereo, you will have a problem with the concept of a CD slot mount.  I give Mountek 5 stars!  Why couldn't someone have come up with this right after technology switched from cassettes?  Thanks, Mountek.
