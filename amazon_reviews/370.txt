Wall mount with goodies
this wall mount seems flimsy and cheap.  It goes together fairly easy, its smaller than my other 2 wall mounts I have so I was skeptical.  The 51" tv I mounted is 48lbs, it went on the wall through the studs without any issues.  the mount is extremely rigid, I weigh 220 lbs and I hung on it just to make sure I wasn't going to lose my tv.  It did not budge at all! I am extremely pleased with this mount, for the price best bang for your buck.  the level had bad reviews, I did not use it I have a laser level.  The hdmi however, works perfectly fine I'd buy this kit 100 times
