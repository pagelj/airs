Fast camera!
I LOVE this camera.  I wanted a small camera that took fast shots.  I bought a 16 mp Canon for this reason and was very disappointed in the shot delays.  It took 6 seconds to get ready for the next shot.  This little panasonic is super-responsive, and takes the photo when the button is pressed.  It is almost immediately ready for the next shot.  I am very happy with it and my husband, who uses a fancy camera, says it is a very impressive point and shoot with tons of extra features.  This is a great buy.
