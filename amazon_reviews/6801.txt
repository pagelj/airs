insanely good!
I had heard of this book many times before and had seen it in book fairs at school, and it's particular genre isn't one that immediately appeals to me. I'm a little ashamed to admit that it took seeing the movie preview to finally strike my fancy enough to get me to buy the book, but once I began, I couldn't stop reading it. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it either. It's going to be a book I recommend over and over and read again and again because it has so many layers to uncover. In fact, it I weren't writing this at 2:19 a. m. I might just begin re-reading it right now, I enjoyed it so much! I don't care care what age--advanced elementary readers to adults--this book will deliver.
