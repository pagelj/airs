Mountek nGroove Universal CD Slot Mount
I've tried other mounts in the past... vent clip-on style, etc. but they never lasted for more than a week. However, this mount works very well and is holding-up nicely. It is pretty solid because there is no long arm that allows for a lot of movement. It can be mounted "upside down" too, so there is a great amount of flexibility in mounting. The tension for the ball/socket pivot can be adjusted on the backside.
