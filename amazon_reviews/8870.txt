I bought this as a gift for my mom who loves having a lot of coffee during the day. Not only does it serve that purpose well but it seperate water resovoir is great for people like me who don't drink coffee to pour my self hot water for tea or my cup of soups for lunch.  This is a great gift for college kids and people on the go as well.  Easy to use, heats great and wonderful safety features.  This is my product of the year hands down.
