We purchased this machine after a vacation where we became accustomed to conveniently consuming espresso on a daily basis.  Our previous experience with an espresso machine was limited to a dual coffee/espresso maker from Krups that we received as a present. It was a cute idea but very entry level; the machine was very light weight and since the espresso function was manual, rather unstable due to its extreme lightweight. It was also quite difficult to clean the steam/milk frothing apparatus; I never really felt it was clean. We eventually stopped using the espresso part of the machine due to the poor design.*This* machine is very easy to operate (I'm not at all technical) and to clean, and while it wasn't cheap, it certainly didn't fall into the small used car category.  It's important to read the user manual (keep it handy for the first 1-2 weeks so you can look up what to do when the little lights illuminate), but it really a very easy to use espresso machine that produces lovely coffee.  We have used it at least once a day (sometimes 2-3) for about a month, and have not encountered any issues.  You'll quickly learn what the little indicator lights mean, and won't need to look them up in the user manual. I took a cue from another reviewer re: discounts; we also purchased ours at Bed Bath Beyond using the 20% off coupon.  At this price, 20% off is significant!  I also felt that it would be better to purchase locally so we could return it quickly and without shipping issues if there were obvious defects (there were not). I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a more affordable high quality espresso maker that is easy to use.
