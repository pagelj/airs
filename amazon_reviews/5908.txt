A good Sci-Fi read, made me think
I bought this on the recommendation of a few lists on Amazon. I was trying to get back the the basics of good thought provoking sci-fi with an action/military element. This book delivered! The aspects of time dilation and how they could be facing an enemy from their future or past and how it took weeks to decelerate from lightspeed, whew. The characters were well portrayed, the scenery amazing, and the ending... well, read it for yourself. I have also read Ender's Game and Armor, in keeping with my current reading scheme. Both excellent and all three I'll read again.
