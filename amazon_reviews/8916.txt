A fantastic show dead before it's time
I can't begin to describe how much I love this show. It somehow manages to mix magic and mystery in a way that managed to be interesting and exciting all at the same time. The acting is fantastic, especially Paul Blackthorn as Harry. Paul's take on the character is so fantastic that even reading the novels the series is based on, Blackthorns voice takes over in the first person narration of the books. The storytelling is right on, keeping the a tone somewhere between film noir and smart alec. If you missed this show while it was on, this is your chance to see what you missed. If you were a fan, buy the DVD and show the powers that be that this show HAS fans and they made a huge mistake by canceling it. Seriously, I don't buy many series on DVD, but this one went into my DVD collection the day it came out. You have no excuses. Buy it!
