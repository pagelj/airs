Fantastic device!
Bought this two months ago for a recent trip where I knew my phone would likely run out of juice mid-day, away from a power source to recharge. This battery pack was a godsend! Yes, it's on the heavy side - I expected this - and it *does* take overnight to the better part of a day to recharge the pack from completely dead to full, but it also charged my iPhone 4S from 0% to 100% a total of 4 times before the pack itself needed a recharge. It does a decent job of holding its charge when not in use; it still shows full power after sitting unused for the past three weeks. My only disappointment was the USB wall charger provided will not fit either the provided USB to mini USB cords, or my phones charger USB plug; the opening is apparently too small and the plug will not go in more than half-way. A real shame, but I simply use the wall charger from my iPhone instead. This battery pack was a lifeline to a Bostonian friend the day of the Marathon bombings; her phone was at 20% when news of the event reached us while we were at an amusement park on the other side of the country. She was able to check in with friends and family without worrying about her phone giving out. That alone made the purchase worth it, and she (and other friends in our group) instantly got on Amazon and bought ones as well.
