Great camera for traveling!
I was a bit unnerved at the look of the picture through the viewfinder - quite grainy.  But the downloaded photos were super, and the ease of use made it a great camera for the non-camera-tech that I am.  Batteries still going strong after a week of snapping anything I saw, and the recovery between shots was plenty quick enough for me.
