Apple TV fascinates/frustrates me
To start with the good, Apple TV simply fascinates me about the technology.- Seamlessly playing music, videos from my Macbook, iPhone- The First time setup was simple and effortless- Can easily watch Netflix, Youtube, Photo Stream, iTunes movies etc- Very compact and sleek with unmatched packaging skills as ever (for any Apple product)My frustrations are- Sometimes my Macbook and iPhone doesnt recognize the presence of the Apple TV. I have to reboot the Apple TV so that it gets listed in the list of devices for Air Play. This has happened to me 5 to 6 times in the past 1 month.- A single remote works for both my Macbook and Apple TV. If i operate the remote for Apple TV, the iTunes in my Macbook also responds simulataneously to that remote control clicks.- There was once when i tried to set up my wife's ID as well in the Apple TV after restoring to the factory settings. But this restoration did not help but this crashed my wireless router's security and the router went down. I reconfigured the AppleTV again to my apple ID to restore the wifi router back to normal. So, some function in the "Restore to factory settings" is incorrect for the AppleTV.- The AppleTV key board on the screen is hard to use (i felt a PS3 keyboard was even easier to use on the TV screen than the Apple TV keyboard)
