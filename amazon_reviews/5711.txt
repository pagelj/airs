This is literally the best book I've read this year. Seriously. A young boy, Jacob, grows up hearing stories from his grandfather about the orphanage he grew up in surrounded by some very peculiar children. One is invisible, one has bees living in his stomach, one can levitate, and one can create fire in her hands. Sounds very much like the X-Men, no? But, these aren't super heroes, just regular children. And Grandpa might have been making it all up. Jacob travels to the island to find out for himself. I seriously hope this is the beginning of a series, because this is such a deep mythology and there are many, many more stories to be told here. The writing is crisp and witty, prompting me to chuckle aloud on several occasions. Jacob's character is well drawn, and even secondary characters, such as Jacob's father become dimensional as well. But the best thing about it is the collection of photographs included, interspersed amongst the tale. These are actual found photographs, which the author claims to have doctored very little. They are eerie and haunting, and very lovely. I am so impressed with this author, and again, very much looking forward to more.
