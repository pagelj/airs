Roku HD is better for older non HDMI TVs
I was so excited about jumping on the streaming bandwagon that I told everyone I met during the week I waited for my Roku 2 XS to be delivered that I was getting a Roku.  My excitement disappeared the moment I powered it up.  I thought the jittery washed out video signal would correct itself once I registered and updated the player.  No such luck!  So ever the optimist, I exchanged the player for a new one but the second player had the same video quality.  I did a little troubleshooting with the second player by connecting it to a different TV and using a different A/V cable.  Observing the video signal while inserting the A/V cable into the player revealed that the video portion of the connector was not making proper contact inside the player (Disconnect the audio connectors on the other end of the cable if you try this!).  I returned the second Roku 2 XS for a refund.  The Amazon exchange/return process was the best part of this adventure. After doing a little more research, I purchased the Roku HD and Wow!  What a big difference.  I have no problems with the Roku HD.  The separate composite A/V (yellow, red, white or component blue, red, green) connection is the way to go with a non HDMI TV.  Keep this in mind even if purchase a different brand streaming device.
