Bought this for my daughter...
My daughter absolutely LOVES this laptop. Very good quality and a very good brand. Lenovo used to be called IBM and is a fantastic choice for any computer need. This laptop is fast and has plenty of memory and processing speed to keep the average PC user very happy. If you want a computer for gaming, I would suggest a different model that has a little more power but I would still go with a Lenovo brand. Much cheaper than Alienware. The same laptop on another site was about $80 more because of the shipping and tax which Amazon did not charge! Saved me a lot of money and made my daughter and me VERY happy.
