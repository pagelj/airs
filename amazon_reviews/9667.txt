a must
I guess it should came with the kindle, in the box. The need to charge the device is a reality. The need to conect it to a computer is not. I can use my kindle without connect it to a microcomputer for months, and I d√≠dn't realize why the power adapter was not included with the kindle. But it is expressaly advised on the shelf of the kindles. I bought it as an accessory, but I really used it before I could configure my new kindle. It's a must have for all kindle owners, indeed.
