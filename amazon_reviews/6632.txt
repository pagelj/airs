No boast for Krups toast!
I never thought a toaster could be so difficult. The instructions aren't helpful, and my toaster just does not toast on "1" setting as promised. I haven't tried the "3" bagel setting, but the toast does not pop back up as it should. The digital timer counts down then returns to another full count, causing the toast to burn. No, I plan to pack it up and return it. I'll go back to using my 30-year old Toast Master that never fails me. This time the product didn't live up to the name Krups.
