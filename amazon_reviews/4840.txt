This is the second time I've owned this model coffee maker.  There is one improvement that makes using it much nicer, but there are two things that are still a problem. The improvement is the way the flter baket attaches to the coffee maker.  It used to just hang by two little tabs.  It used to be much easier to accidentally knock the filter off, than it was to get it hung correctly.  The new one now has the bakset permanently attached, so it can't get knocked off at all. Unfortunately, enough time had passed since I owned the first one, that I forgot about the things that frustrated me then.  They are still frustrating. First, the drip-through lid to the carafe is difficult to get on straight and level.  When the lid isn't on straight, the brewing coffee doesn't go into the carafe, but runs down the sides.  I suspect Cuuisanart has heard complaints about this, because the manual expressly says not to put a towel underneath the coffee maker during brewing.  It would be nice if they would fix the lid instead. Second, the pouring slot in the carafe lid is very small, and even when the indicator arrow is pointing towards the spout, coffee comes out in a dribble, instead of a smooth stream.  I've found that it's most effective to completely remove the lid to pour.  But then of course the firt problem rises it's ugly head again. Oveall, it's an okay coffee maker.  But, having to worry about getting a carafe lid perfectly level and lining up little arrows *before* I've had my morning coffee is not much fun.  Neither is having to sop up spilled coffee from allover the counter.
