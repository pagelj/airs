The Air is a good vacuum for many situations. It is very light, bagless and has a washable filter. A mandatory feature, we really appreciate is the power head brush can be turned off to handle hardwoood floors. It has an extremely long cord! The suction is excellent, but because there is no stationary brush on the head, it does not retain adequate suction in the head to pick up the finest dust from hardwood floors. Since we picked up this vacuum for spot cleaning and for specific tasks that are difficult with our Princess II, it serves its purpose very well.
