There are several reasons I love this vacuum:1.  It is compact and easy to store in a nook or small area.2.  The see-through canister lets you see if it needs emptying.3.  Goes from hard floor to a carpet brush at the touch of a switch (conveniently located up high on the vacuum, I might add.)4.  The carpet brush has enough suction to really do the job, but doesn't suck up the edges of a carpet mat like a regular vacuum does.  It really freshens and fluffs the carpet mats, as well.5.  Nice, long electrical cord.6.  A swivel head that maneuvers easily.7.  A twisting cord hook that makes it easy to wrap and unwrap the cord. We use this vacuum almost daily to clean up after three cats who are very vigorous about tossing cat litter around.  This is a must have if you have small, daily cleanups or simply want to keep hard floors or small carpeted areas. spotless.
