Great Buy
I bought this monitor for my two year old triplet's room.  They are still in cribs but one of my boys fell (jumped?) out the other day.  I ordered this to keep an eye on things without having to be in the room with them.  I am very happy with it so far.  Really easy to set up and use.  The night vision works really well and the kids don't seem to be able to hear when I move the camera.  I bought an extra camera thinking I would need it to be able to see the whole room, but one is enough to scan across all three cribs.  This will also be really handy when we make the switch to big kid beds.  Three kids making the switch at one time!  Yikes!!
