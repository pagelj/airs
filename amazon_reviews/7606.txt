Excellent concept, easy read, but missing some depth
The concept of this book (humans as somewhat super race being used as potential soldiers in alien conflict) is certainly interesting and the book was very readable.  However, I felt that some of the detail of the environment and characters was a bit below the level I've experienced in some of the more prominent Sci-Fi writers.  The storyline was good, the characters interesting, so definitely worth the read.  The book is relatively short.  I'm debating reading the second book in the series.
