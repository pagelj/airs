You always get what you pay for, this one worked out!
This product is very basic, and for the CHEAP cost, it was exactly what I expected. I am happy with it. It looks nice and I am confident taht it is good enough to protect the camera. If you want something super high quality, you can easily pay TEN TIMES OR MORE, but again, for a few bucks this did the job just fine!
