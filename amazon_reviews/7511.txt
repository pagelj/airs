Malfunctioning Disc Tray
I can attest to the other reviewers' complaints about the disc tray not working as intended.  I bought a refurbished model along with a 50 pack cake box of Verbatim DVDs with the intention of converting three boxes of tapes over.  I plugged the new-looking machine in through HDMI and then the power cable.  After a quick set up, I was in and ready to go! Well, I got as far as putting my first VHS tape in, anyhow.  The disc tray would absolutely not open.  The on-screen message popped up for a split second when I tried to eject the drive on DVD mode (as did the LCD on the unit itself), but nothing else would happen.  I waited a little longer and tried it again, this time the message said "Closing", as though the tray was already out. I went digging on Amazon again (the first page reviews are way too glowing for this annoyance) and typed "tray" into the search.  Apparently mine isn't alone in this nonsense.  It seems to be a nice machine, otherwise, but I'm unable to review any other parts because of this showstopper of a problem. Returned to Amazon (who are champs at refunds -- many thanks, as always) and am going for a Toshiba DVR620 instead.  Bad on Magnavox.
