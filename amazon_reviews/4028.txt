Great mount and out of the way.
I am not blocking a heat/air vent with this mount.  It plugs directly into the CD player of the Truck, which I very rarely use.  The mount does not move and seems to be made well.  I have used it with my work phone the HTC Evo 4g and my personal phone Samsung Vibrant and both work in the mount perfectly. Thanks!
