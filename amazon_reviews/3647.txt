I wanted a vacuum cleaner, not too expensive, and one that would do its work effectively. I ordered Dirt Devil and since the day it has come, I am just loving it. It works like magic on carpet and for such an affordable price. I would highly recommend it. My husband was a little fussy when he came to know I ordered it but he has no regrets now, even he thinks its the best!
