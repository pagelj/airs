Great Perfect Camera!!!
Coming from Canon point and shoot and seeing it's limitations, i finally decided to upgrade to dSLRs. I wanted an entry level camera at the same time will give me that room for me improve as i grow my photography skills. I narrowed my choice between Canon 50D and Nikon D90. Knowing that both are almost match with the 50D better on the spec sheet i went to a local camera shop and decide which one feels better in my hands. Being a Canon shooter it was hard for me to even look and try the Nikon but when i got my hands on the D90 everything changed. It felt better, not too big nor small, not too heavy or light and plasticy feel and it just feels better in my hands than the bulkier 50D. I really liked the control layout better, and the quick info button that i eventually remapped to my quick menu which enables me to change AF modes quickly and easily. The pictures are just amazing and i could switch between different picture controls i've set for people (nice skin tones) and to things (saturated, popping colors). The 4.3 fps or so speed is just perfect to capture my 1year old son and the 18-105 kit lens was just perfect zoom range for my needs. Again not too heavy. I also have 70-300VR lens for some telephoto shots. I've had my D90 now for almost 3 months and the new D5000 and Canon T1i that have come out and if i would have to redo it again i'd still go with the D90. The HD 720p video is ok and a nice to have feature for some quick video clips of my kids. Overall, this is a very nice and more than capable dSLR and is right in the sweet spot of beginner (D40, D5000) to pro cameras (D700 and even D3).
