GREAT Value!  16GB Class 10... FAST!
I have purchased a few class 10 SDHC Cards.  I also have Sandisk 8GB and Panasonic 8GB.  The Transcend is the one I use the most often.  The main reasons I use this one the most is because its the largest and just as fast.  While I know the Sandisk is supposed to be the fastest, I really do not notice that much of a difference.  So, if you want a great performing SDHC card and the best value per GB, consider the Transcend SDHC card!
