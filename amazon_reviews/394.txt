Very impressed yet again
Very easy to put on. They even include a little sticky sheet to help remove any dust that might get stuck. The antiglare matte is definitely something you have to get used to. I have the ultra clear on my ipad and this on my iphone and while I like both its definitely for different reasons. I'm really not sure what's better, fingerprints/oil smudges with a perfect screen or no fingerprints/glare but with decreased clarity.
