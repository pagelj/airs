Monster battery for an absurdly low price!
Wow this thing is just awesome, will charge my iPhone 5 from flat 3 times and still have a little bit left over, it also ran my Raspberry Pi for 36hrs so great for projects 'on the go'. Being 10000mAh it does take a fair while to charge from a regular 5W USB but using a iPad 12W charger alleviated this problem. All round a really really good deal for $40!
