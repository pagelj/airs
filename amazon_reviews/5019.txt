Wanted to be thrilled & was not...
I feel like I paid for more of a history lesson and cute little stories than I did recipes. Yes, he is a great chef and the recipes are wonderful; but still .... I also bought Chef Paul's ... La. Kitchen ... good but disappointing also; because90% of his recipes are just about 'the same'.... like peat and repeat... and it waswritten in 1984 ... and yes... recipes won't change.... but 1984... give me a break ! Then I bought Susan Spicer's... Crescent City Cooking ... this is a great book !
