Big and Awesome!
I LOVE this bag.  It is super big and the 3 sections make it easy to organize and find your stuff.  The cross-body strap is perfect for hands free shopping and would be a great gift for any girl who likes the room and look of a big bag.  It would also be a good gift as a diaper bag because you could carry enough baby supplies without Winnie the Pooh all over it!! Wished I got it in grey too but the brown looks great!
