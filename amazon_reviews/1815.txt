very slow delivery
It took forever to get delivery on this item. It was ordered two weeks before it was needed and arrived two weeks after it was needed. Somebody dropped the ball on this one. I had to buy one from someone else because of this slow delivery. And, they would not let me cancel this one because of where it sat in the order sequence. This was shipped from Amazon.
