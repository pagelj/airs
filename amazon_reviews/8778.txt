I've had this monitor for a year and a half and it works great! This is my first and only video monitor but I see no reason to buy anything different. It is a great price compared to other baby monitors and I love all the functions. Also I see no need for voice interaction and I honestly think it would freak out my daughter. If you want to be able to see and hear your baby this is the way to go.
