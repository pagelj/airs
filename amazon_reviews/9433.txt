Not great
I'm not going to take off too many stars because I just didn't know what I was buying and it's practicallity. Assembling the multiple rings is a pain. Try figuring out the amount of macro setting you would want and use only that. Also be ready, as most have said, to love your auto focus. This has no electrical contacts to "talk" to your lens.
