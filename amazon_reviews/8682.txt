Agree with the other reviews re: hard to get water in the right place in the top, generally messy upper areas, and especially the condensation/leaking from the lid problem. One other thing to consider: We had a small power surge in our house after a recent outage. The only appliances in the house to suffer damage were this coffee maker and a Cuisinart electronic toaster. Both apparently had their circuit boards fried and now are headed for the landfill. Maybe not a design flaw, but it's the first coffee maker I've ever witnessed dying that kind of death. Anyone need an extra caraffe?
