I prefer thermal carafe models and chose this one because of the generally high user reviews on Amazon and other sites.  I like the attractive design and found that it makes good coffee and keeps it warm for a few hours.  I haven't had the problem of coffee spilling out over the counter except for a few times when I failed to line up the arrows on the lid, as per the instructions.  I would give this product five stars if it weren't for the fact that the plastic handle and top completely broke off two different carafes.  Both times, this happened when my husband was pouring from it and hot coffee was dumped all over the counter and floor.  Luckily, he wasn't burned.  The first carafe broke after only four months of use and the second lasted a little over a year.  Cuisinart honored their warranty and sent me a replacement for the first carafe without requiring that I pay any handling fees or ship back the broken carafe.  I just spoke with their customer service and they are sending me a second replacement, but I am required to send them the old carafe.  I have no faith that this third carafe will last for any length of time, so I will likely be searching for another thermal carafe coffee maker model with decent user reviews.
