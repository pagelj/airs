Very cool - watch YouTube installation first
Got this up and running and viewable via my iPad and iPhone in about an hour or so. VERY helpful to watch YouTube video from "Awkward Hamster" who has a couple of step-by-step videos. The small installation booklet they send is very minimal and makes more sense once you watch someone else do it and explain it. NOTE:  the dyndns. org Dynamic IP address forwarding that is specified in the installation is NOT FREE. (or at least I couldn't find a way to not give it my credit card)The YouTube video shows how to set this up using no-ip. com for free.  It is working well for me. I'm ready to buy my outdoor model now.  I love being able to watch my stay-at-home dog-cam during the day. Great product and price.
