Clever flick: Mormons merge with Scientologists and Luciferians
Usually I don't like this film 'documentary' genre, but here they did it right.  If you're familiar with Mormonism, you know it's founded on the idea that Jesus Christ and Satan are extra-terrestrial brothers who fought and carried that battle down here on Earth;  those voting for Christ (who also paid for sins, by the way) and loyal enough to the Mormon creed, will get whole planets to rule and procreate forever, populating said planets. L. Ron Hubbard changes the plotline to different alien races who have engaged in cosmic battle from oh so long ago, folding in the idea that the Jews are 'body thetans' invisibly attaching themselves to your life and health, to stop you from becoming a higher being.  To gain dominance over them, you pay thousands and thousands of dollars (or work practically for free) to get seminars and other tutorials 'teaching' you how to think and act so you can grow past your own humanity.  Because, you aren't really human. Next, the whole time travel thing with Luciferians mixed in.  You know:  parallel universes and all that Atlantis stuff.  Search in Youtube, if you are unfamiliar with these really kooky groups. So this film kinda spoofs all three 'religious' groups, but it's not campy.  It skates near the edge of campy, with 'Luna' people dressed just like Mormons, the 'Luna' books mimicking L. Ron Hubbard's book covers, etc.  Yet the plotline is serious enough, and the acting is good enough, to pull off the edgy satire.  After all, these groups are truly scary, in real life.  They've committed crimes of great magnitude during their time: just Google to see the reports in the news, over the past 50 years or so. It's an enjoyable film, well-shot.  It works.  I'm glad I saw this on Amazon Prime.
