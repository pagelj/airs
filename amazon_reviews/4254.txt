My Neice Loves It!
I got this for my neice for Christmas, and she instantly LOVED it!  She's 18 months, and can navigate the buttons really well and is quickly consumed with what's happening on the screen.  The LeapFrog laptop is set-up to grow with her.... the content will easily be on her level for the next 2 years or so.
