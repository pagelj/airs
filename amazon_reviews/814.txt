The best of the best
This is the best book I've ever read. It's completelty surreal! The book is somehow divided into a few stories told by the pilgrims traveling to Hyperion. Each story is simply stunning, and they are all related. Everyone has something to do with the Shrike, the most bizarre character I've ever read in a book. Everything in the book is brilliant, except the ending. A word of advice, buy Hyperion AND The Fall of Hyperion at the same time.. trust me..
