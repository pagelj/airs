Purple is dark & drab
The online product photo shows a beautiful royal purple case -- not as bright and eye-catching as the hot pink or yellow, but distinctive. The actual case that ships is more of a washed-out charcoal with a purple tint. What a disappointment! I am satisfied with the case itself. I like that opening and closing the cover automatically turns the Kindle on and off. I just wish I had bought it in a different color since the purple doesn't look like the photo.
