Not what I expected
When I purchased the camera case with the camera as a recommended bundle I assumed the case would be for the Nikon SLR I purchased. It is actually for a smaller Digital camera. It is a nice case but not my expectation. I will keep it for my smaller digital camera. It is a nice case.
