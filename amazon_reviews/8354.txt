Great Product
Screen was delivered quickly and was packaged to protect the very fragile part. This only comes with the screen so if you need tape or tools you need to order them seperatly. Looks as good as the original part that came out of the ipod. Installation was tedious but doable. $20.00 saved the ipod.
