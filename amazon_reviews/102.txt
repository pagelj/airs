Suction not great
I have had this product for a few months now and have used it for short drives around town and also for a 12 hour road trip. My preference is to have it mounted on the lower left side of the windshield and I have not tried it on the dash (partly due to other reviews stating that it leaves a mark on the dash, partly because that's not where I want it). Perhaps it's just me, but the "suction" feature does NOT work well and it seems to rely on the stickiness on the suction cup more than the suction itself. My Garmin Nuvi has a suction mount which works perfectly, so it's not a problem with the windshield. I tried cleaning it like recommended, and it does not help much at all. It doesn't seem to matter what the weather/temperature is, it will fall off regardless (just a bit faster when really hot or when the suction is dirty--which happens very easily since it's sticky). I finally figured out a way to mount it with the bottom angle resting on the dash and the suction on the windshield, so when it loosens it doesn't fall. I've become trained very quickly to repeatedly press it into the windshield while driving. Also, I've tried many different combinations of the product and it doesn't make a difference. It also falls off when there is no phone in it, so it's not the weight of the phone that is the problem. All that being said, the part that holds the phone locks it in very securely (iPhone 5, don't know the case brand) and it's VERY easy to get the phone in and out of while driving. The many ways you can move the different parts to get the perfect angle is GREAT. I regretted buying it and would have given it one star before figuring out a way to support it on the dash. If the suction actually worked, it would get 5 stars.
