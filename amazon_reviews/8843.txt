I bought this te replace an old and heavy Kenmoore canister vacuum. Hoover Windtunnel is very powerful. Too powerful that the small carpets and runners get stuck in suction and hard to move. I find it a little inconvenient to switch from floor to wand. You have to unplug the floor hose first and plug in the hose for wand.
