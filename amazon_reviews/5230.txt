Incredibly Informative, times 10!
I had subscriptions to most of the American zines. About the only thing learned = what new cameras had been recently released, and even then, the writing style is akin to cheerleading rather than need-to-know info like noise and image quality. I cancelled them all, and instead started making monthly treks to my local newsstand for this and other UK zines. Simply stated, I learn more per issue than I do reading full books on whatever topic. One issue may be devoted to landscapes, another to macros, flowers, sunsets, etc. If you genuinely want to learn how to improve your photography, THIS is your key. BTW, do NOT think this is all about dSLRs only. While I do have a dSLR, I also have a pocket-friendly Fuji e900 digicam (replacing an FZ50, which itself was replaced with a dSLR). The e900 has multiple dSLR-like controls. This zine teaches what control to change to get which effect in a particular circumstance, so it's also manna for those with digicams sporting an aperture/speed control dial mode, as well as white balance, exposure compensation and other tweaking controls. It's admittedly a big chunk out of your wallet in one step, but turns out, it's the best bang for the buck long term.
