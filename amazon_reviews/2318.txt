Entertaining but uneven Mil SciFi
First, I should note that I enjoyed most of "Poor Man's Fight" By Elliot Kay.  His writing style is clear, establishes momentum, and his main character, Tanner Malone, is well drawn.  His combat scenes are as intense as you will find anywhere.  And his vision of a corporate future of haves and have-nots is believable. That future, and the title, establish Malone's dilemma that pushes him into enlisting.  It then plays only a peripheral role in the tale, which is basically that of an intellectual raw recruit who must find his inner warrior.  Oh, and there are pirates to fight. The boot camp section of the book is well done but it's fairly familiar stuff.  Once Malone is assigned to a corvette, however, the action picks up. Characters are introduced and fleshed out, only to be discarded later.  Some are good, some are bad, some are confused, but it doesn't affect their fates in the end.  Not a complaint, since that probably mirrors real life. Tanner Malone, on the other hand, is an awfully capable young man, with a strong and perhaps even too strong moral compass.  I wondered how his talents could have been so completely unrecognized by an expanding military, but that didn't detract from the story.  But when he unleashes his rage, he becomes a killing machine capable of accomplishing unbelievable things a la "Die Hard".  Despite its being thrilling, I'm afraid this destroyed the realism of the story for me, and cost the book an extra point. Nevertheless, as I said at the beginning, I enjoyed "Poor Man's Fight" and intend to read the sequel.
