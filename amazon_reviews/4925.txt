SX40 or SX50? Both are great!
I've had my SX40 for somewhere between six and eight months and am very pleased with it. Since I wanted a second camera (and found a great deal on the SX50 for only $6 more than I paid for the SX40), I bought that as well almost two weeks ago. Seeing as a lot of people are trying to decide between the two- and since I have both and have been using the SX50 a lot lately- I would probably rate the SX50 a little higher for it's obvious zoom and image stabilization when filming, as well as a few other things, but I like the SX40 autofocus a little better in low light and enjoy using it too. Overall, if you find an amazing deal on the SX40 coming up around Christmas and Boxing Day, and don't care much about a little more zoom, and don't anticipate shaking the camera too much, or aren't bothered about RAW and a few other things (not everyone really cares!), then I would highly recommend the SX40. Or, get the the little brother of the SX40, (for about $100 less), the 30X optical, 16mp and smaller but similiar, SX500 IS.
