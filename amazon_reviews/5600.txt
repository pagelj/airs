Really amazing blender!
I bought this blender on Amazon a few days ago because I needed a smaller blender for my breakfast smoothies, and I am absolutely thrilled with it! At around $15, this is certainly the best mini blender out there on the market. If you need a high quality blender for small, single-serve smoothies, shakes, or other blended drinks, this is the blender for you. It's small enough to be compact and easy to clean, but not so small that it doesn't work. Its design is simplistic and easy to use. I recommend pulsing it and blanding for around 10 seconds, then stopping for a second or two, and then continuing with this pattern because sometimes it can get a bit overworked and give off a slight motor-oil smell. This only happens if you are blending very hard or large items or blend for too long without stopping occasionally. This is the only minor con about this product, and can be easily prevented if you handle it with care. This blender works just as well as any  big blender, and its compact size makes it even easier to use and clean than any big blender. The blender also doubles as a travel mug. Just make your drink and go! To clean, just hand wash it with some mild dish soap and you're ready to go. Overall, I highly recommend this blender and I hope you'll take my advice and go get one!
