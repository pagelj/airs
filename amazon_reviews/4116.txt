Works great
I don't need the accuracy of a tool for measuring heart stents or anything, I am using this to monitor wheel wear for my inline speed skates. It is great. Super easy to use, accurate, convenient. The digital readout is a nice extra, it is super easy to read. This is perfect for my needs and affordable. I suspect it is capable of being used for much more precise work, I just don't do that...
