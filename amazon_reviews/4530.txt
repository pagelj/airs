Magic!
The immersion reading on the 8.9 is magical! It is like having a paperback open as two pages are visible at a time -yet you can still alter the font to equate that of a large print hardcover edition. Truly wonderful to have the option of professional narration when you buy both the kindle and audible books or turn down the volume whether in immmersion reading or in text to speech to have the pages turned automatically. I think the screen resolution is noticeably superior to the Fire HD 7 inch which in turn is better than the Nexus 7 - however it is close and it is on sound that Amazon wins on both versions of the Fire HD. Music is fabulous on the 8.9 although I do not detect difference between the 7 inch HD and the 8'.9 as others have noted. There is a new difference in the keyboard which will take a bit of getting used to - the period has been replaced by an apostrophe. Long hold to get popup selection which then allows you to assign period or alternate punctuation to key. The processor seems  noticeably faster as my book archives appear instantly on the 8.9 and can take a full minute on the 7 inch HD. I sold my original Fire so cannot make comparison with that one. I love it and the Amazon experience it provides!
