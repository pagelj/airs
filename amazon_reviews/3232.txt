Broken after 7 months! - Just needed new batteries
As mentioned, there are flaws in the design: too quiet, shortest timer ever, limited sound options, but we STILL ended up using this just as much as the white noise ap on my iPod because it's convenient and my baby can safely chew on it. Although I have no idea what kind of chemicals are used in its chintzy fur and stuffing. Unfortunately, now this sub-par sheep is SERIOUSLY broken. All the sounds have developed this horrible crackle in them, like loud intermittent radio static. It's more jarring than soothing and has actually woken my baby up from a deep sleep. I think the convenience of having a cute toy tied to the side of my baby's crib has finally ended. Sorry sleep sheep. You're going to the landfill. UPDATE: Well, my husband replaced the batteries and sure enough, sleep sheep is back to normal! Sorry for the false info.
