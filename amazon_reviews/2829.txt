GE cuts through the chase
I love the camera just based on its solid, heavy build. I have come to realize GE is the company that simplifies even complex functions for the consumer and prices its product with the consumer in mind. Took a few pictures, loved it. All indoors. I have decided to read the manual bcos i believe this camera is worth reading a manual for. I normally dont read manuals.
