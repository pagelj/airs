A non-essential item
So now I have this lens shade in my bag if I EVER need it on my 50mm f/1.8 lens.  This fast 50mm lens is used almost exclusively indoors, or in shaded areas outside where lens hoods are unnecessary.  Hoods are for blocking unwanted sunlight from the lens surface.  It is cheap, and maybe some day I'll use it.  But, it takes up space in my traveling gadget bag, so it is the first to be left out if I'm tight on space.  Think twice before you buy this.
