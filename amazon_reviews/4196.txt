If you're a beginner, you'll take better pictures after chapter 1.
Seriously.  I bought this book when I bought my first dSLR camera because I was a little intimidated by it.  After reading chapter 1, I got a pretty good idea of the basics of my new camera and felt comfortable enough to get some really nice shots.  The amazing thing is, I decided to pull out my old point and shoot camera which the dSLR was to replace and see if I could take better pictures with it using the techniques in this book.  The result was pictures 100 times better than those I took before.  For a minute I questioned whether it was really time for me to upgrade, and whether I spent all that money for a dSLR too soon.  But whatever, I'm over it. This book offers extremely practical advice for getting pictures in the settings most consumers find themselves taking pictures.  Vacation, weddings, kids, etc.  It simplified for me which settings I really need to pay attention to and which were nice-to-haves.  I actually read this book while on vacation and found myself taking better pictures day-by-day, chapter-by-chapter. The author also offers practical advice on equipment, with an eye toward cost.  This information is sometimes hard to find online because article and forum topics focus so much on the latest and greatest stuff which, not coincidentally, is the most expensive.  I knew I would be spending money on more stuff, but now I feel like at least I have some guidance. I love this book and I'm pretty sure I will be reading it a couple more times because there is so much great info in there.  That said, if you've done a ton of research and reading already or if you're a professional (obviously), this book is not for you.  If, on the other hand, you've only used a credit card sized point and shoot until now and you've just bought your first dSLR camera because you're getting ready to have your first child (like me), this book will definitely help you get the most out of your camera.
