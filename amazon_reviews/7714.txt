Amazing read
I read this book every year like clockwork. I cannot express how much I enjoy this book. Retelling Hosea would be a difficult task for anyone but Francine River's Redeeming Love is astonishing. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of prostitution but also is not graphic, it's just real. I fall for Micheal every time I read it and cry at Angel's pain. This is easily one of my favorite books. A sweeping love story and a wonderful message of love and forgivness, you will just have to read it and see if you like it too.
