No trace of my purchase
agreed it is shipped from chinaagreed it is cheap dealagreed you can not provide tracking informationBut... at least give a better estimate when the product will be arrived and not give any more advices to keep myself calm over just one mail communication to ask why i cant see the tracking information and when i can get the product I have paid for. its been over a month now... and seller still thinks that their ESTIMATED time of shipping, which by the way has a range of whole month, may be arriving anytime.... ANYTIME, seriously? A week's range for shipment to be received is acceptable, a delay in that as well can be tolerated up to some extent, but this is not the way you keep your business. Deduct a payment well ahead a month and then tell buyer, HEY KEEP YOURSELF CALM, WE HAVE ALREADY SHIPPED YOUR PRODUCT, AND WE DON'T HAVE TRACKING INFO, SO WE CANNOT TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BUT IT WILL BE THERE BETWEEN SOMEWHERE IN NEXT 30 DAYS. and after that i am still not sure if this work or not.
