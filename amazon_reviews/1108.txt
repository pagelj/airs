Canon PIXMA MG2220 Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier
I bought this printer for my mother who is in her 80's and needed to replace anearlier model HP printer which had worn out.  She loves it.  Easy to use and easyto replace the ink and paper.  If she feels like that then this should be the idealprinter for everyone as she is very particular about what she uses.
