Rushed...
I understand this is a novella, however I felt the author rushed the story causing it to be unbelievable. The characters weren't true to the society of the time, nor were they strong. The author tried to have too much going on at one time. Also there was no build up to the romance. It was two days and they were in love and so was the servants. The husband fights so hard to get his wife back, then commits suicide when he realizes who the hero is??? The author asks too much from the readers to believe what happens.
