Very Satisfied
Although I was a bit leery, given a lack of detailed information about the software loaded on the Mac, I could not be more pleased with the product and the seller.  Of course, I am a MAC guy--have been since the start, so the MacBook is a no-brainer; however, the seller provided a nicely refurbished computer, safely packed, and QUICKLY delivered.  The laptop is a gift for a grandmother, so it took some time to confirm needs, and I ordered it late, but the seller came through, getting it to my house in CT over the weekend!
