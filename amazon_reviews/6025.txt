Wow!
I am an adult who loved Hunger Games trilogy... was looking for similar story lines when I picked up this book.  I loved it... different from Hunger Games but similar situation.  I liked it equally as well as Hunger Games.  Liked the character development and the pace at which the story progressed.  Great read for adults and young adults alike!
