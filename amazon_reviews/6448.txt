Good idea, less ideal in reality
Can't get it tight enough in the cd slot that it doesn't droop and bounce around like mad, either causing my phone to fall out or the whole mount falls out. I'm afraid it might damage my cd player so I had to quit using it. Maybe it just doesn't work well with multi changer type cd players? Also the part that grips the phone is too difficult to use. Either it puts a death grip on the phone and you can't retrieve it without ripping the whole mount lose, or its too loose. Alternatively you can push the button,(if you can reach it, it's behind the phone now) which snaps it all the way open with a lot of force sometime flinging the phone if you aren't holding it also. Not easy to use with one hand, you really need two to put the phone in or retrieve the phone from this mount. While I was aware that the mount didn't have a lot of movement range before purchasing, thanks to other reviews, it is worse than I expected and still disappointing. It really has so little range as to defeat the purpose of making if movable at all.
