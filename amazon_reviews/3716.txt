Nice backpack, but it does NOT fit larger laptops
In short, I ordered this backpack for my newly-acquired Alienware M17x R3 17" laptop.  I was aware that this laptop backpack is designed for "most 15" laptops" but I read many reviews that a 17" laptop will fit.  Please be advised that is NOT the case.  I returned it for a Targus laptop backpack that does fit 17" laptops, including mine.  The backpack is nice, has a lot of compartments, and feels well-constructed.  Just be advised it does not fit larger laptops, despite the (mis)information that says it will.  It's unfortunate as I liked this backback better than the Targus.
