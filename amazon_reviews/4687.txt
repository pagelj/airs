This vacuum has so far been phenomenal. I have pets, so am always having trouble with vacuums because the hair always gets twisted up in the roller. Since this vacuum does not have one, there is no issue with this. Instead, it has two strips attached to the top and bottom of the sucker hole that grabs the hair from the carpet, so it can be sucked in. You do sometimes have to loosen it a little, but it's really easy because it does not get tangled up it just sticks to it really well. Ironically, I only paid $60 for this vacuum and it is working better and lasting longer than vacuums I have bought for a couple hundred. It seems to be pretty sturdy so far as it has been kicked around a bit and is still intact.  I like the fact that there are bags because I have severe allergies and keeping all of the crap inside the bag makes it easier to change out than the bagless types. You also don't have to worry about the blowback that you often experience with bagless vacuums. The bag also holds a pretty good amount of crud; I have only had to change it once so far and I vacuum every few days. The suction is great, though the hole where the stuff gets sucked up is a little small. This is not too much of a problem, it just requires you to vacuum in smaller strips. Overall, it's a great vacuum and a great value and I totally recommend it.
