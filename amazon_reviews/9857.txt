Excellent Value for Toner
My history with the HL-2270DW and the TN-450 cartridges:Starter Cartridge - 751 pages, changed 12/27/20112nd Cartridge - 1,999 pages (total printer count 2,750) Changed 03/29/20123rd Cartridge - 2,559 pages (total printer count 5,309) Changed 07/24/20124th Cartridge - 2,627 pages (total printer count 7,936) Changed 11/19/2012I run them until I notice a problem with the output itself, the low toner message comes on long before they actually run out. You can press the GO button 7 times in quick succession to do this.
