tough but low photo quality
i use it to take photos for my open water diver students. the photo quality is as others have reviewed, not good. once i accidentally brought it to 12m, lucky for me no leak. while about its durability, i've brought it for >30 dives now, i'll see how long will it last. rank it 4star as it's cheap (u get what u paid for) and it's convenient since it can go to 10m without a casing.
