Great Lens
It is an excellent lens.  For and old geezer with not to steady a hand, the stabilzer is a God send. Slightly heavy and a bit noisy. When you are shooting wildlife at 50 to 200 yards, I doubt the noise will disturb anything but you. Gives bright colorful prints and works well with flash. Even though I have been using this lens for a short time, I am no stranger to telephoto lens and know a good lens when I use it. I would reccommend this lens to anyone who is looking for a great quality lens and not break the bank. It is a professional type lens thay any amateur can put on their camera and shot like a pro in a short time. Doug
