I live in a tiny 1900s apartment.  Space is limited and on top of that I have physical limitations.  This dishwasher is perfect.  It takes up a little more space than a large microwave but works beautifully.  It holds my china and everyday where.  I bake - a lot - and it holds my mixing bowls as well.  I will never be without a dishwasher again - I love this little machine!!!
