Okay for the first couple uses but didn't meet expectations.... read on
I was really excited to get this toaster. It had replaced once that I had used for many years.  At first it worked great. By "at first" I mean the first couple of toasts. Then the distribution of heat changed. The toast didn't toast evenly between sides of the bread,  It would burn or get darker on one side then the other.  The defrost selection didn't work as well... and, to top that off, some toast started to slip and fall to the bottom. I am very dissatisfied with this toaster. I wish that I had the box that it was shipped in, I would return it.  It went in the recycling bin. The toaster will soon follow the same fate as its box.
