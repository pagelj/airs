Good Premise, Engaging Dialogue
John Oldman is quitting his professorship and friends gather at his home to wish him a fond farewell.  Pressed by his friends to explain why he's leaving, John reluctantly tells them why.  He tells them the story of his life - a life he claims spans all of 14,000 years. John's story is incredible to be sure.  It's intellectually challenging and often riveting, especially when he addresses matters of spirituality and religion.  If you're offended by challenges to sacred beliefs, you may wish to pass this movie by.  Yes, some of his friends' reactions to the story are over the top, and the movie is clearly low budget.  But, frankly, I might have enjoyed it even if it had been recorded on a smart phone.  The story John Oldman has to tell comes across loud and clear, the dialogue is engaging and the rental was worth every bit of my time.  I like stimulating the brain cells once in awhile and this movie hit the spot.
