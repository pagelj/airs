I am a hard to please person with an innate need for things to be clean.  And when I clean something, I want it to actually be clean and not half-assed like a swiffer mop.  My friend had this Hoover and she ranted and raved about how amazing it was. I went to her house and was blown away with how clean her floors were with pets.  She let me borrow hers in attempts to further convince me and I was so impressed with the ease of this machine. The vacuum is for surface dirt not visible chunks. Even with that, I still recommend using the vacuum option prior to the washing option so that you aren't scrubbing unnecessary dirt on your floors.  The machine is very light weight and easy to transport up and down stairs.  I like that the handle folds down to increase the ease of transporting and storing.  The plastic is very light weight which also means breakable. So, just be careful taking the pieces apart; don't rough-house it.  The washing option is just about perfect and the floors are dry within seconds.  I gently wash my filter after each use to prolong its life. Now, I just sit and stare at how clean my floors are. I highly and absolutely recommend this product.
