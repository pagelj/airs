Great Adapter, Great Price
I purchased two of these for use with my Apple computers. I have an Early 2011 13" MBP and a 2012 27" iMac and the adapters work great. They provide clean audio and video over hdmi. You must select HDMI output under sound settings if you want to get it to your TV or Stereo. Don't let other reviews fool you, this is a great adapter that has Apple cosmetics and quality.
