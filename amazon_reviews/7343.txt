Happy with our first tablet!
I purchased this tablet mainly for fun~for me and our 6 year old daughter!  It turns out we are having more fun than we ever could have expected!  It takes really nice video and pictures and our daughter loves that she can access everything with just the touch of the button!  She's been playing games, listening to music... for the price, it's PERFECT for what we needed!
