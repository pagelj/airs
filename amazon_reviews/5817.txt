First... he is crazy. Second... get an editor!
The English teacher in me cringed several times. You're is not to be confused with your.  And loosing is not the same as losing. Ditto to affect and effect. I've seen better use of those "tricky" words in an 8th grade essay. But that's just the start of my problems with this book. He's just crazy. This is the kind of guy who ends up with a wife faking her death and making her escape. Seriously, this guy takes the alpha male to the edge of the cliff and then takes a flying leap off of it. I won't be buying the rest of the books in this trilogy unless my body is  taken over by pod people. He interferes with her job, won't reveal something as simple as his age, and constantly exerts control over her in the most basic areas - such as what she wears while she's in her house so no other man can see her goodies. Puhleeze.
