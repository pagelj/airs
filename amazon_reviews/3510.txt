I have to admit, it was my mistake not full realizing how small this coffee maker was when I bought it. It basically makes enough coffee to fill one travel mug, so I'm pretty much always stuck brewing two pots to get enough java. Feature wise everything works as expected. The timed brew feature is handy for setting before you go to sleep. I haven't had any problems with it over all, barring the size factor and that you need to specifically get the Mr. Coffee brand filters for it in order to brew a proper pot. These are not as widely available in my Manhattan neighbourhood as you might think, so I end up getting dinged $7 for shipping to buy a $2 item from a non-prime amazon retailer.
