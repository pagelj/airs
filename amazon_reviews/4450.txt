Excellent kinves with a traditional look and feel
These are three of the most used knives in my kitchen and I have a full set of matching Chicago cutlery. The only reason I gave the set four stars is that it does not come with a block. Loose knives are not a good idea. Mineral oil will protect the wood from hand washing and using a steel or ceramic occasionally will preserve the edges of the blades. I prefer corn oil as over time it protects the wood, darkens the walnut as it oxidizes and looks great. These knives, like any good knife, should not be placed in a dishwasher. The detergents strip the wood of oils and the heat can affect the edge holding ability of the blades. I have given many of these knives as gifts. I also recommend the Metropolotin series if you must use the dishwasher.
