A mix bag of lollies
A mix bag of lollies, Is how i sum it up  - some classics that are worth viewing that you would watch a second time some old 50'-60's b&w that are cleaver , some are simply plain "cheesy" and other the quality is so bad they shouldn't have been put in there in the first place. But what else do you expect? a star war collection?  "Well, that will be double the price -sir",... any way I also brought also "Sci-fi Classics " and say this probably the better of the two sets. Plus you only need to put disc in once to play four movies where as 'classic' it's two movies  side and need to flip over. If you like si fi buy it.... if you want cheap movies don't... J.
