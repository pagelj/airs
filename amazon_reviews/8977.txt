Awesome device
I wasn't sure if I should upgrade at first but boy am I glad I did. This device is ten times better then the first Kindle Fire. It's brighter, faster, and is much more comfortable to hold. Highly recommended. Also recommend the 8.9 if cash isn't an issue. The bigger screen is definitely worth it.
