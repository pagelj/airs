I recently purchased the Cuisinart Classic Toaster Oven after much research.  I chose this oven because of its size, the easy-to-read knobs, and the easy-to-clean crumb tray.  I experimented a bit with the right settings for toasting, but now this oven makes the best toast I've ever made. I'm completely satisfied with this product.
