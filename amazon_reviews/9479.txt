Easy to install, low profile
My husband and I had this mounted in under 15 minutes.  I think it would be really tricky to mount the TV on it without a second person, but it's probably do-able.  The TV is about as close to the wall as possible (a priority for me) and it feels very secure.  I like that I can't see any of the mounting hardware from any "natural" viewing angles.
