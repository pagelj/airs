This vacuum is the most economical, powerful, yet lightweight vacuum I've ever had.  Easy to use, and really good on pet hair.  This is the second one I've purchased after giving the first to a relative who can't use a heavy vacuum.  This one is even better than the first--improved longer cord and doesn't pull up lightweight throw rugs.
