Great But..
It's a fantastic media player, the only thing i don't like is it's shape. It's thin but it's very long, and the curved trapezoidal shape is kind of weird. Other than that it's pretty fast. Oh and also has ringed ridges on the top part, so if you're a clean freak like me, that will upset you.
