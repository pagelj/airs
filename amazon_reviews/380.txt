I reread this frequently.
I first read this book in Junior High and really identified with it. Since then I have reread it multiple times and it has stayed salient. It's a book I give away and recommend often. I think the success of the book is the realness of the characters. Never at anytime do you feel like you are reading about children. I believe that's what makes it work. I never remember thinking of myself as a child when I was one. All my experiences then were just and important and consuming as the ones I have now as an adult. It's that perspective and belief that I feel resonated with me as a child and still now as an adult. This is one book that will be on my children's reading list.
