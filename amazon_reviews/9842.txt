OK
I kept hearing tons about this one so I decided to give it a try. I would give This Man 3.5 stars. I thought it was good but it wasn't great. Ava, an interior designer who is clearly naive and Jesse a pretty dominate, pretty rich owner of a "hotel" meet when Ava is called upon to help decorate some rooms for him. This Man starts out OK. Jesse is super intense and he makes his intentions very clear from the start. Ava is very hesitant and clearly confused about what she wants. Ava does a lot of back and forth which in my opinion is very annoying. I liked the dominate side of Jesse. He was a bit much at times but I guess it was warranted. I really enjoyed the ending because we found out more about Jesse and Ava and it wasn't just them having sex every 5 minutes. I hear it only gets better though so I'll be starting Beneath This Man pretty soon.
