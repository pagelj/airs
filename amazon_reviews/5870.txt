Really good, portable
The screen definition is wonderful. The navegation is fast enough. However, the screen tends to freeze from time to time, and won't recognize when I touch on a link. I think it may be a callibration issue, but I can't find a how to fix that. Overall, it performs as I expected for an under $200 device.
