Cheap, poorly made
I bought this for my son who has a Toshiba laptop of average size.  Right out of the box, we were skeptical.  It was smaller than we had expected, probably more suited for a netbook.  The other concern was the plastic is very thin and easily bent.  But the main concern was that the fans are exposed - there are no covers or guards over them and though they are weak, it's still not a pleasant experience to get your fingers clipped or things tangled up in them.  The only good thing about it was that it looked really cool when it was working, sadly, it only worked for a month. Save your $$
