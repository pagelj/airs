I have had this vacuum for a few weeks and it is one of the best. My only complaint is the noise. The motor is very loud, but most vacuums are. On the good side: it is relatively light, the extension wand is very good, and the suction is powerful. Ratio of price to quality is excellent. I am unsure why the extra hepa filter is so expensive (at around $20-25), butat least there is one available, though I have to say that the exhaust is nowhere near my old vacuum, and I am not sure the hepa filter is needed when using the allergy efficient bags. Overall, a super good buy.
