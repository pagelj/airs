Very Good
This cell phone holder is very good. The width is adjustable so it fits most of the cell phone on the market. Good mechanical design, it is easy to pup out the phone when needed. One thing I did not like is that the base has to be permanently attached at one single spot. You can not move it around when you are driving a different car. You can not dismount it either after you glued the base to one spot.
