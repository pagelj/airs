12000mAh all you'll ever need
Upon receiving my IMP120D I knew I would be taking this product with me where ever I went, whether it'd be school or any sort of trip where I new i'd be away a wall charger for some time. This is the product i've been waiting for because I'm both an Iphone and Droid user so I need 2 usb ports to charge both my phones at the same time instead of switching off usb ports with other external 1usb batteries. This battery is one of the best I've seen. Just the 12000mAh capacity and what makes it stand out. Which other external battery would be able to charge your iphone 6 times fully from 0 to 100% without needing to be recharged.
