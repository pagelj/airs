Good buy for Average Camera User
Hello All,I have always wanted a D-SLR Camera because I just thought they were so cool! I never really wanted to use all the features I just liked the ability to take great pictures, fast and easily. This camera does the job. I looked at the Nikon as well, but ultimately chose this one because of its ease of use. I've taken about 300 pictures so far and the battery has not yet died. The Nikon is a "better buy" for a experienced or a wanting to be experienced camera user. The main menu is far more confusion and accessories more expensive. But that is a personal decision. i wouldn't buy this camera if you're looking for something totally special, it is perfect for me. Cons: shutter sound sounds like a toy camera, kind of weird. lower megapixels than the equivalent NikonPros: EASY TO USE, EASY INTERACTIVE MENU TELLS YOU WHAT EACH OPTION ISGret Camera for the Buy
