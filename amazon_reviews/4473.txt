AVATAR (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition)
When I was fortunate to see the movie @ the theatre in 3D I was left breathless. For the very first time I felt like I was being told the story while being involved within the environnent itself. I did not want to come back.  When I got my opportunity @ this special dvd compilation the saddest moment was the fact I must watch it in 2D. But with the added minutes, giving more of an informative back story for Earth along with previous events on Pandora made for a knock it out of the ball park entertainment for myself. I am a true movie slut, but as far as my ultimate favorites it's a very small group & for any new movie to enter that list the Bible must have been re-written.  With this, AVATAR, it was. My #1 is Gigi, then we go into The Women ('39), The Best Years Of Our Lives, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Mildred Pierce, Mrs. Miniver, The Enchanted Cottage - some modern day one's are Grease, Vincent Price horror movies, Hamer horror films, any Hitchkock TV/Movie, even Julie & Julia. Now Avatar is in my definite "Love Those" & I could watch them over & over. The best part is when you've seen a movie so many times that you feel you know all there is to offer, & suddenly you are pleasantly surprised to find that how wrong you were. Admittedly, my top 5 Fav's are in the category of old classics - but This AVATAR version comes closer than anything I have seen in "Years"..  So- Go for it - Do Not let this movie (this version) not be a part of your movie library &/or to watch & enjoy list. If you look hard enough you'll see me there working on transforming so to live in an untouched amazingly beautiful world.
