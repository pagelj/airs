Good Stuff
I bought this bag to replace a larger bulkier backpack that I use basically as a storage unit for my camera gear.  It's well built, very comfortable to wear, and can hold quite a bit of gear. I strapped a full sized tripod to the back, stuffed my camera and a spare lens inside, and rode my bike about 10 miles no problem. I was surprised to find that, after all that riding, that the tripod had not wiggled loose at all. If you're looking for a pack that allows you to stay highly mobile and hangs on tight, this is the pack for you. I'm going to take it rock climbing next.
