Great price, good product
I bought this cable for use with an X-Box 360 to output HDMI to a 1080p TV.  The image quality is great and I have had no issues with the cable.  The extra length makes it easy to properly route wires to hide them.  One of the cheapest and best HDMI cables on the marker, I will be purchasing again.
