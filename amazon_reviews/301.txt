Got this for my son's fourth birthday because he always wanted to take pictures with my camera. This is very simple to use. It does not take high quality pictures but it is something he can have fun with. His little sister (1 yr old) has dropped it 3 times and it is still working fine. note: It does not come with the usb cord to hook it to the computer. However, my son has just enjoyed taking the pictures, looking at them on the screen, adding hats etc. and then deleting.
