I love it, but...
... yea, other reviews about the ridiculous gem costs for the main ponies are right. I enjoy having my own little Equestrian on my kindle, but I don't want to have to spend ridiculous amounts of time or money to finish the game. Also, the app is sometimes laggy, but it's nothing an app restart won't fix.
