Ahh Mars in the Spring
What would you do if you were left for dead by your crew?  What if you were left for dead by your crew on Mars with no chance of rescue for several years? Astronaut Mark Watney comes to from a near fatal accident to find this is his reality. The Martian is a great read, a modern day Robinson Crusoe that will have you turning the page to see what happens.  Well worth the $.99. I've spent a lot more for a lot less.
