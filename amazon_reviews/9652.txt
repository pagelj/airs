Does the job
I bought a handful of HDMI cables through one of those one day at a time online sale places.  They failed or broke mostly.  In particular, I have one cable attached to the side of the TV with the other end dangling until I attach my laptop from time to time.  So it needs to be hardy.  I know enough not to spend big money on cables.  But now I also know not to be too thrifty.  The AmazonBasics offers the perfect marriage of reliable and low cost.  That's what I love.
