Well, well...
I bought this player, despite the myriad warnings of others about the imminent failure, characterised by the whining of the disk drive and its failure to play discs.  Well, it happened to me after less than 3 months... with VERY little use!  The first product I have rated as 1 star, after shopping at Amazon for nearly 20 years!  This is the single biggest piece of junk that I've ever wasted my money on.  The good thing about it, is that it is DLNA certified, and so it sees your network shares and NAS, and can stream movies and other media brilliantly. It recognizes most (if not all) of the popular media formats - I'll give it that. I can't comment on the LG Network apps, since they are unavailable to me, as I live in the Caribbean (not the player's fault!). However, one star, since it is PRIMARILY a Blu-ray player, and it fails miserably at that!
