Works like it should
I'm in no way anywhere near a professional photographer, it's just a fun hobby and I've only used this a few times, but it's worked the times I have.  For doing "bulb" shots it's wonderful to not have to stand there and press/hold the shutter button, eliminates the camera from shaking & yourself.  I did a practice test on a single shot and it will work nice to not set a timer and run to get yourself into the photo before the timer times out. I have even bought one as a gift for a friend that she too enjoys it very much.  She's used hers more than me only because she will wake up in the middle of the night to take pictures of the Northern Lights.... lol  Each time she has the wireless remote has worked like a champ!
