very disallusioned
I bought this bag last July. The first week one seam came apart, the next week a zipper broke.  Two weeks later another seam came apart. A month later another seam came apart. The week after that another zipper broke. I have all of my new equipment in the bag and it is just about full.  I would not recommend anyone buy this bag unless you want your expensive equipment to fall out!  Very disappointed!  However the padding inside is nice.
