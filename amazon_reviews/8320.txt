Very nice instrument
This caliper has been extremely helpful to me in my hobbies. I don't need to hold up rulers to things like metal rods anymore, estimating their measurements. Now, I can use this tool with total confidence in the measurements' accuracy. For the price, this caliper is fantastic quality.
