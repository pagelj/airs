Great little camera
This camera was bought as a Christmas present for my "technology-challenged" mom.  As a result, it was very important to find a camera that was easy to use - the buttons are easy to see, big enough to press/turn for arthritic hands, large screen to for viewing, and intuitive usage for the standard "point-and-click" camera to give clear, fantastic photos.  It is a vibrant red, compact and durable. My mom was thrilled to receive this little camera - definitely a great buy!
