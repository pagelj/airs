Pleasantly Surprised
I was prowling Amazon looking for books to read and came across Wool Omnibus Edition.  I found the concept intriguing and saw great value in the price as it included 5 books.  I got through Wool 1 and was hooked... I looked at it as a great short story and then figured out why it was so cheap, it was a collection of short stories not books.  Boy, was I wrong. The Wool series branches out from this first brief tale into more book length editions and progresses in a fashion that kept me hooked as a reader and hungering for more.  Each story digs deeper (pardon the pun... for those who have read it) into the story and wraps up the past beautifully in Wool 5 and I'm assuming segways into the new legacy being created in Wool 6 and beyond (I'm going to be purchasing those now).  In my opinion, you will be hard pressed to find a better value on Amazon in the Kindle book store.  Highly recommend!
