In The Market
First of all, I have yet to purchase this camera.  The reason I am adding a note here is because of the extremes in the reviews.  How can a camera that some see as the best thing since sliced bread be such a dismal product for others?  There has to be some user issues here, or perhaps in-experience in point and shoot cameras or photography as a whole.  This makes it very hard to reach some sort of viable conclusion as to a true rating of this product...
