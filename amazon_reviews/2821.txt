Undersized for my Sony DSC-HX5V
Amazon bundled a battery and this case when I purchased the Sony DSC-HX5V.  Problem is this camera just doesn't fit very well in this small case.  The lens is slightly raised and the camera is just a little too long for this small case.  The Velcros really has to stretch to fit and I fear that if clipped to a belt the velcro could come loose and the camera could fall out.  I don't know if it was amazon or sony that suggested bundling these, but it is not a match.
