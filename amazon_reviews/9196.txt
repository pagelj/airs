worked great
I used this with my new Pentax WG3 camera and it worked great.  I was worried about my camera being too heavy after reading other reviews, but it worked great. My camera floated fine, and I used it snorkling in Hawaii. It stayed easily on my wrist, and never came unattached from my camera. I shared it with my husband while we were in the water, and it fit his wrist as well as mine. I don't have small hands, so anyone with average or larger hands need not worry that it will fit. I also bought a new Nikon black strap to wrap around the float as extra protection as my camera was brand new. It helped ease my anxiety, but I didn't need it. (I always feel better with double protection). I do think it makes sense to test the weight of your camera with the float first in water. My camera is not light, and it floated great. I had NO concerns whatever. I highly recommend this float if you are in the water. No lost camera.
