This is totally useless to me. I have a digital Rebel XTI with a Sigma lens. This unit will not stay on the camera. As soon as I make any adjustments with the lens, the extension tubes disconnect from the camera body. Fortunately, I always have my hand around the lens, so I haven't dropped it. Into the trash it will go.
