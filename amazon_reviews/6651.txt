For many, Samsung/Android products have become useless as networking fails
Unfortunately anyone considering this device should Google-search the term "Issue 36993:  wifi no longer working in ics 4.0.4 " or simply "galaxy wifi authentication failed".  Essentially at this time you may find yourself without any option to connect to the internet. In other words, a pretty useless paper weight. The various forums have several threads on the topic where users, including IT professionals, who own android devices are reporting the problem and not finding a solution or work around. Typical posts from the above read:* "just signed a 2 year contract. Had I known about this issue I never would have committed my two years to this device. Now Im stuck."* "I am too extremely frustrated that for $700 i have a piece of plastic doing a half job... simply unaccceptable.  Google needs to push some kind of update ASAP and start treating the android project seriously..."* "Huge problem!!!! Bought 2 galaxy 3's and a galaxy tab 10.1 2 all with no ability to connect WiFi!! This is unacceptable!!!"A bug in Android, introduced in v4.0.4 and persisiting through the latest Android v4.1.2, prevents android devices from connecting to many, mainstream, wifi routers. If your home/office router is one of those, tough luck.  Users have these routers working fine with all non-android devices (ie iOS, Windows...). Also, many Galaxy devices (including mine) worked fine up to the v4.0.4 upgrade. Personally I had been an advocate of the Samsung Google product family.  When first activating my S3 I thought apple does not currently offer any phone that can match it. However the lack of networking functionality, and lack of communication by these companies in the several months of this issue persisting should be unacceptable and potential consumers here should be aware and beware.
