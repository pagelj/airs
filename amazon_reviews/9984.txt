Cheap, works
Did you just put some A/V equipment in your shopping cart and need an HDMI cable?  Then get this product.  It's cheap and it works fine.  You may be suspicious because the cable is *too* cheap (as was I) but don't be.  This is a perfectly fine product that gets the job done for a cheap price.
