Cuisinart Toaster Oven
This is a very nice oven.  The only problem is that the back half of food, such as pizza, seems to get over done. Also, you have to be careful when opening the door because the metal strip at the top of the glass gets very hot.  I just got a nice burn on the top of my finger.  Other wise it does a good job and is easy to use.
