Beautiful, Stunning, Redemptive
A novel of love and forgiveness. A story of grace and salvation. Angel, wounded by the mistakes of others and scarred by a life of prostitution, is offered a chance at a new beginning. Michael, a hard working, God fearing man, is determined to show Angel a life of love, with him, and through Christ. With the help of Michael, Angel is guided to the only One that can erase that stains of sin. Yet such a trek is not easy. In order for Angel to accept Michael and the Lord she has to let go. She has to loose herself from the chains of her memories. She must conquer the demons of her past and overcome the darkness that threatens to drive out the light. The shadows that attempt to cut her off from Michael and the Lord. As Angel falls further and further from them she struggles to reach for both Michael and Christs, who are calling to her with open arms. I couldn't put it down. I found myself reading late into the waking hours of dawn. The book is riveting and enchanting. Rivers weaves a world of spirituality and intertwines it with the honest truth of what it means to search out our Savior. Redeeming Love is the first book Francine Rivers wrote after finding her way to Christ. Through this spellbinding story she offers the reader a raw, new perspective on the vital role of the atonement and the necessity for His redeeming love in our lives.
