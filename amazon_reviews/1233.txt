Book of the Year
This book might be the best book you read all year, possibly the best book you read all decade.  It's just your typical cyberpunk coming of age love story mystery adventure about online gaming.  The plot is tightly constructed and the story makes you laugh, cry and cheer.  However, the best part of the book is how it weaves and integrates Generation X geek culture throughout the story.  There were major references to my favorite games, video games, anime, books and movies throughout the book.  Seriously, this book was written for uber-nerds like me and it was almost like I had written the words myself.
