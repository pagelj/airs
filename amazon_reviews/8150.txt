I like the older devices better!
Ok, this is a fast unit but it is totally stripped down for the money. It is about the same price that my son paid for an older version but this one has no digital audio out or component cable connections. (none of the new ones do) This unit is much smaller than the older ones and runs a lot cooler. But the only hookup options are old school A/V cables or HDMI. This is fine for most standard users. But I have a rather intense video setup with my A/V equipment in a cabinet about 40 feet from my projector. This is way too far to run HDMI without expensive repeaters. (it all goes through the walls and ceiling) And what the heck is with the little tags sticking off the equipment?
