Good mount
Hey there... I've got two of these, one for a media center monitor (20 inch) in our living room and one in my office holding our main PC (24 inch) monitor. These mounts are sturdy enough for what we've thrown at them. Once in the wall they are very secure and hold the monitors nicely. The articulating arm is a nice bonus, I don't use it in the office but it's a nice feature for our media center monitor. As some reviewers have pointed out, the actual mounting of these can be a little hard to get level. Our first one (HTPC) was installed "level", until we put the monitor on it. Then it just kind of sagged a bit to the right (left of monitor was higher than the right side). Basically what I did to correct this was unmount the bracket and readjust the screws to where the monitor itself was level, leaving the mount slightly off kilter. Problem solved! With the second one I used this method the first time around and achieved perfect results. For the money and for basic install needs this is a really good mount and I'd certainly recommend it. Just be careful to have the monitor level before final installation. This may take an extra person but it's worth not having to go through the hassle of re-installation.
