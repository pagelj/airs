Great cellphone for the price, but be aware...
The cellphone is awesome for the price, but if you don't live in a supported country you wouldn't be able to access the App Catalog (App Store like). So you won't be able to download any "extra" app such Facebook, Angry Birds, etc. The phones does come unlocked (I got it directly from Amazon, don't know about the other sellers), looks very good and the webOS is a very solid and beautiful OS. If you're looking for a cheap, modern, and unlocked phone the Pixi plus is the best one!
