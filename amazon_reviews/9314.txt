Wonderful product
I'm very pleased with this product - it's well made and returned my entire set of knives to like-new sharpness.  Also very easy to use right at the countertop. I'm a cooking enthusiast who loves "the process", so I hand-chop a lot of fresh ingredients nearly every day, so the sharpener will save me time over the years and ensure precision of the knives' edges.
