A "must" if you own the Kindle Fire
This case was sent so quickly, and I just love it ! My last older model Kindle took a dive when I kept it in my purse without a case, and something leaked on it. No chance here, and I love the way it stands on it's own, and turns on automatically when you open it !! Great investment, all around ! Edith Degenstein
