disapointed
The unit works well if you only want to use the sterio function of what you are connecting.  I was looking to use it to attach mic'd headphones to my cell phone, but the mic function did not work.  The only thing I could do is listen to music, but not talk on the phone.  At least it was only a couple bucks lost.
