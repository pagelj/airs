item was more damaged than anticipated
Seller was truthful about the fact that the screen was free of damage, however, he/she neglected to mention that there were major cracks and chips on the edge of the ipad. Item worked as intended however, I felt the price should've been lower for the amount of cosmetic damage to this item.
