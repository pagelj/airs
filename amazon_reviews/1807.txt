Great phone and tons of features
Replaced a 10+ yr old Panasonic cordless phone with this one. I really like the key pad and face lighting up and key features like "Block List" for some of those pesky telemarketers. It's nice being able to put in a phone book entry once and it goes to both handsets.  I was able to bluetooth my contact list from my cell phone which saved a ton of time.
