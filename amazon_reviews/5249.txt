Great for camping!
Went on a 2 day camping trip with this pack.  I had at least 35 to 40 pounds of gear packed in this bag.  The straps are very comfortable and can adjust to a wide range of sizes.  The straps sometimes popped out from the clip at the bottom of the pack, it did not break, just had to be popped back in and that only happened when I adjusted the straps too tight.  I kind of wish the side compartments were a little bigger to fit a flashlight or some other objects that are longer in size.  The balance of the pack is good, I had no problems while climbing up steep hillsides.  It was able to fit everything I needed for my 2 day venture.  It is excellent for the price and I would completely recommend this to anyone.
