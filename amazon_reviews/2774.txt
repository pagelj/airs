Very unsatisfying
The novels in this series have always been rather slow.  I still remember plodding through The Game of Thrones wondering if it would ever get going.  Luckily, after I got through the first 100 or so pages, it did get moving and soon I was completely engrossed.  That same formula seemed to work for the other novels as well.  Some setup but eventually the story moved well. Unfortunately, not this book.  It was all setup and it had no climax!  Nothing. Sure he through in a few quick surprises at the end to try to justify the reader's time but after waiting 5 years and reading 959 pages all I can say is "that's it?".  I thought at least we would have had a big battle for Winterfell at the end.  Nope. George R. R. Martin has clearly become addicted to character POV's so much so that I dont think any of the main characters had more than maybe 150 pages focused on them.  Given that each had their own subplot none of them was able to get any sort of momentum for their stories. Now don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed aspects of the book.  I like quite a few of the characters and even Dany, who I loathed early on, has become more interesting for me.  But I have to say, another book like this and I won't be reading any more in this series until it is officially over.
