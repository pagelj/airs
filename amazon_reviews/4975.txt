have had too many issues, returning it and switching to another brand
I have to update my review as we originally bought two of these units, one got into trouble after few weeks of use where the buttons on the unit (play, stop, eject buttons) broke and we could only use the remote to operate these functions. The other unit was working ok. We exchanged it through the seller (Electronic Express which truly had great return and exchange policy with no hassles) but the new one started malfunctioning after just few weeks where it does not read and load the movies and besides, it hums and makes awkward noises. I am returning this item (which electronic express easily accommodated) and am not buying a Sony DVD player again, at least not this model.
