I have problems with this phone
I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15. I know it's been a while. But last week while the phone was loaded heated at a temperature too high, it was impossible to touch the high temperature that had. I started using it disconnect, but the phone is not turned on, and only works if it is charging. Otherwise the phone is useless. What could I do? I lost my money? Who do I contact? I do not live in USA, so I find it impossible to communicate directly with the seller. But I'd like a BIG problem solved. thanks
