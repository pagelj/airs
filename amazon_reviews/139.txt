Time-space continuum at its best
I have only recently started reading sci-fi novels and came accross The Forever War a bit by accident. From the first page the narrative had me hooked; the main character starting-out as being 'just normal' and ending-up as being extra-ordinary. The action flows incessantly and never ceases to get dull. I especially liked the way society (and the codes of conduct and acceptable behaviour) back on earth changes throughout the story. A highly recommendable read.
