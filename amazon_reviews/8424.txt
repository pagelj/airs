Superb Desk, Great Price!
This is a great desk!  My wife bought it and had lotsa fun putting it together when it arrived.  For $60, we were concerned that it may be a bit flimsy, but this thing is built like a rock!  The base and adjustable stem are sturdy and well built.  The top is put together in a "knock down" fashion, so it's easy to take the "wings" off at any time, if needed. My wife's laptop fits nicely in the middle and the only drawback is that there isn't enough room for a USB drive - but that's not a big issue.  We could take off a wing if we needed to put a USB in. There is enough space for all her paperwork, a cup of coffee, pens, paper, etc - all laid out the way she wants.  At the end of the day, the whole thing folds up and tucks away nicely. All in all, this was a great purchase.  I will probably pick up another for myself shortly.
