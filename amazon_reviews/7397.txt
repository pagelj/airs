For the $20 ( or $15 I got them for ), you get a complete set of knives in a  block that gives convenient storage.  I had gotten this set because I had thought to replacing my JCPenney Sokotu 7 inch main knife and 3 inch paring knife set ( $15 originally ) and my 5 Faberware steak knives ( $8 )In the end, I kept this set for space savings over sharpness but substituted the blades.  The scissors that came with this is the best item in the set.  The serrated edges just do not cut well.  The unusual serrated edges are sharp but not as sharp as you can do with a regular blade edge you get when you run it on those roller sharpeners.  The last thing you want to do when cutting meat or anything is to force the blades down with pressure to cut.  You end up doing that with the large main blade.  The steak knifes are passable. Overall I ended up keeping my original main knife and paring knife.  In hindsight, I should have bought a wood block but for about the same price, I got this set and just substituted back my original knives.  If you don't have any knives, get this but consider replacing the main large knife for your everyday usage.
