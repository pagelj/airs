Over the years we have purchased several vaccuums.  None have compared to this one.  We absolutely love it!!  It does a great job on all surfaces.  We have hardwood, carpet, and stone tiles.  This vaccuum handles it all with ease.  From the bedrooms with carpet, to our gym with hardwood along with our stone tiled bathrooms, living room and dining room with hardwood and area rugs, to our stone tiled kitchen and sunroom... all look great!  The onboard tools stay in place and work very well when needed.  I would highly recommend this vaccuum to anyone looking to purchase one.
