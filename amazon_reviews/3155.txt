Great for new dad or parent of toddler
Got this because my diaper bag was getting too big and heavy to lug around with an increasingly active toddler.  This bag has tons of compartments, a removable pouch and diaper pad and the insulated pouch fits two 10oz sippy cups.  The lightly padded straps and back make it very comfortable to wear and also has straps for the stroller and a handle to carry around on the top. This is the perfect size for a toddler or for Dad's diaper bag but may be too small for a mom with a newborn.  Wish we had gotten this at first for my husband rather than a messenger style bag. Has a sporty rather than fashionable look but does look slightly better than it appears in photo. I do wish it was all black though. Great value for the price.
