Does a lousy job
We have had this model for 2 years (now given to Goodwill). Right from the start it does not toast evenly on both sides of the bread. Cuisinart usually does a fine job, but not with this unit. Is it so darn difficult to make a simple toaster? We replaced ours with a Kitchenaid KMT4230 & are happy with it.
