Great concept!  Limited application.
Works great in one of my cars (a Honda Pilot), but not in my the other (a Toyota Rav4) as the latter has a slightly rounded dash. This requires a perfectly flat surface. Please also not that this can be mounted with the tightening screw either up or down depending upon the application. In either mounting scenario it is likely that the display of your stereo will be blocked. Grip on phone is only adequate. If over tightened, phone will come out of holder. Stop at bottom can be easily removed if needed to accommodate larger phones.
