Finally a sharpener that WORKS!
Have tired many different sharpeners including the Chef's Choice electric sharpener which does work but it is a bit of a hassle to set up etc. This "manual" sharpener is obviously quick and easy to use and it really works well. I am sending one to my son as he has a good set of knives I gave him as a gift several years ago but he has let them get very dull.
