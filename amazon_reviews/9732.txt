I got this appliance after seeing it on HGTV and reading the reviews here - and I've been pretty pleased with it. It makes good egg muffin sandwiches and works as advertised.  The reviews here were very helpful in making my decision. Know that the first time you use it it will smell like burning plastic - this seems to be normal but the smell diminishes fast. Also the first time I used the egg poaching tray the teflon coating started to come off.  It's just a sprayed on coating over a metal "skillet".  I called the number for Back to Basics - they acknowledged that it is a manufacturing defect and are sending a new replacement.  I have not received it yet but they were very friendly and helpful. My only real complaint is that it can't do two sandwiches at once!  That would be nice if you have two or more people in the household.  Since it takes about six minutes to make a sandwich one person is finished just as the other one is sitting down to eat.  Of course, that would make the size much larger and the current size is quite nice - it' only slightly larger than my toaster. If you have ten minutes to spare in the morning and like egg muffin sandwiches I highly recommend this product.
