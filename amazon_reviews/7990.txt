I bought this vacuum  about 3 years ago. The suction is great but the wire is bald in 3 or 4 spots, and today the hose split from me just pushing on it. The area had been stressed  as for some reason it formed a dent in the hose that i could not fix and would often suction itself shut when using it. So I tried to squeeze the hose a little with my hand hoping that it would fix it and in stead it split the hose. I am not sure if I would purchase this model again.
