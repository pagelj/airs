Something out of the ordinary
Jerome Bixby's The Man from Earth is a film that deserves a royal place in the movie collection of anyone who consider themselves a "movie lover". This film is all about the screenplay and the story, the entire film is captured in one location, and it has no special effects. I can only imagine how hard it would be for the people given the task to make a thrailer for this peice. So naturally, the trailer show all the most exciting scenes and gives away a little too much for the film to be truly enjoyed. I would just advice anyone who enjoys a really good story, intelligent dialogue, and maybe a little provokative thinking, to buy this film. Plus the commentary track with the actor John Billingsley and Director of the film Richard Schenkman is really funny and worth taking the time to watch through.
