Not what I expected
I bought this but ended up returning the item to Triplenet Pricing because they don't care about their customers and the item was bigger than the size ordered with a damaged zipper. In the end I purchased a sleeve from HP which I'm in love with till now also it was cheaper and with better quality material.
