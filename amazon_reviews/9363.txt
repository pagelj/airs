I love this Hand-vacuum.  It has completely replaced my Dyson for everyday use.  It has great cleaning capabilities and for the non-super-duty-cleaning it does a GREAT job.  Its suction power is just not enough to handle the really deep in there dirt like for example the crease in the runner on my stairs, but for the rug part itself its wonderful.  I don't have any real carpets in this house [aside from the runners] so I do not know its how it cleans on carpets higher then 1/8-1/4 inch high.  I use the "rug" function for my kids rubber play mats and it cleans them spotless [It even picks up the dirt I thought I would have to wash off].  If you are comparing it to a dust-buster its a little bit heavier but its very comfortable to hold and the handle placement is not hard on the wrist.  The only flaw I see in the vacuum is the filter is a pain to clean off but I just use my Dyson to take off the dirt.  All in all a very good purchase and I would definitely buy it again.
