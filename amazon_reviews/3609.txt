This has All the modern features you could hope for. It is small and has a short hose reach (hose extenders can i'm sure be found). I have a two bedroom apartment.. i do not need the 3-400$ version of this vacuum. This has only 1 washable filter. who wants extra filters to worry about? Its the hepa filter that helps with the air that must be repelled out of your vacuum for the motor. Has edge cleaning. Has the turbine attachment, which i was new to and they are Great! Is cyclonic! Washable dust cup. Has rubberized wheels and floor brush retracting switch for hard floors (the cat litter in my kitchen, debris and dust in my bathroom and dirt and rocks in my foyer) Has a retracting cord. (when you use these, pull the whole cord out otherwise it sits in there absorbing heat. and when you retract do not be holding onto the cord. retract from the floor)It is a very tightly put together product. You will not find this quality in a hoover or a bissel. This is dyson type quality (and i have seen those that are loose. i think there is discrepancy from unit to unit. Based on my friends units which i have used first hand. And is probably why there is also discrepancy in their fan base; love it or hated it)If you don't like this vacuum it must have been too small for your needs. I don't know what to tell you. If you don't like this vacuum you must need some psychological help. I cant believe i only paid 120$ for this. No seriously when i'm vacuuming i want to baby this because i love it so much... and then i realize i paid 120$ for this! This thing that makes me and my apartment feel like a million bucks... was beyond reasonable
