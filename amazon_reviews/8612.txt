This set is both gorgeous and practical.  It seems as many people have concerns over the knife because it sits on edge on the table.  It does have a tendency to drop or slide off because it is so much heavier than many other sets.  I absolutely love this set.  Plus, I have washed them in the dishwasher for well over 10 months and haven't seen any damage.  But, I also don't use lemon based dish detergent.  Highly recommend this - you will love it!!
