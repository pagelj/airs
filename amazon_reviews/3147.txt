Great Protection, Good
I chose 200 because I will probably never have more than 3 lenses with me on the go. The bag is VERY sturdy. It allows you to store your camera, 2-3 lens, and a flash. There is side bag for water bottle. Great. The other side bag is good for only small and flat objects such as battery, SD card, and maps. The weight distribution is very good. I don't feel much weight walking with it. Good for travel/hiking. Overall, it shines being super sturdy, compact but functional, and finally sharp looking. I have not tried the tripod holder but everything else so far meets my expectation very well. Room for improvement: The side bag could be larger so stuff like battery charger can fit in. Not a big deal, there is a bag inside the backpack for that. Lastly, before you zip this bag, press the cover under the zip protection layer. This makes zipping much easier! Enjoy~
