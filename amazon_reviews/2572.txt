Good looks, the smell... not so much.
This bag looks exactly they way it is shown in the picture. Pretty good quality of fabric too. Unfortunately after I opened the package I was unpleasantly surprised by the smell... I couldn't get rid of it for a long time. I washed the bag 5 times and it helped a lot, but I can still smell a little bit of the scent sometimes... The zipper broke very quickly. I decided to keep it just because I hardly ever use it and it matches my boots perfectly.
