Super slow on my Panasonic camera
This card is complete garbage when it comes to speed. I have attempted to use it on my Panasonic DMC-G2 and it is so slow, that my son is completely out of frame by the time the card is done saving the picture. If you want to use this card to take pictures with, I would stay away from it.
