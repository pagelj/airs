Love this machine. In the 3 months we've had it we have made hundreds of espressos and lattes.  Works awesome, and even nice crema from just reg-fine groud coffee, like Starbucks House Blend decaf.  Great espresso coffee like Illy and Lavazza just rock!  The steam foam attachment makes thicker, fine foam than I imagined.  A great buy.
