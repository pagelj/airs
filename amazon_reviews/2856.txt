20x Optical zoom plus digital.  Can take photos of the moon!  Not kidding.
Amazing camera for the price, I literally can see the craters on the moon in photos. Video is good and nice to have the 1080p, but the Slo Motion feature is only available very small resolution, not 720 or 1080.  Still a cool feature, just wish it did higher resolution slo mo.  But I bought the camera for the compact zoom not for slo mo. :P  Amazing camera for the price. You won't be disappointed!
