My great-granddaughter had me order my toaster as a gift from her for Christmas.  I have only had it a short time, but so far, I have no complaints.  I wanted a red one because my kitchen is red, black, and white and I love the color.  It toasts the bread evenly on both sides which is something I have never gotten from a previous toaster.  I would recommend this toaster to my own kids as well as anybody else.  At this time, I am completly satisfied with it.
