Poorly Made Wheels lock up
Avoid this bag. The wheels locked only after one trip and I was forced to carry it. Upon close examination, the wheels are of the cheapest quality compared to my other rollers. With the wheels locked the bag is useless. Might also mention the handle doesn't return without a lot of struggle, and wouldn't be surprised if that were the next thing to go.
