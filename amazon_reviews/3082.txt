so glad i bought these
i was going to buy a new home phone.  my current one broke.  so fortunately i was cleaning out my closet and i saw an old home phone from 10 years ago.  it took aaa batteries.  so i googled phone batteries and these eneloop's came up.  i needed 6.  i bought the 4 pack.  got actually next day (prime member) plugged into phone and bada boom, worked like a charm. immediate usuage.  came almost fully charged.  bought another 4 pack next day.  put in other phone and same thing.  so for only $20, i basically got a two new home phones.  thanks eneloop.  good stuff.
