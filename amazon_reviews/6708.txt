Don't Waste Your Money
Here's the drill; install the anti-glare shield following the instructions to the letter. Then it falls off. Throw away the first one, I must have done something wrong. Install the second one, taking pains at every step to make sure that I've done it right. Then it falls off. Okay, third time's the charm - right? And then it falls off. These are useless. If you want to protect the screen on your Kindle then buy some sort of case for it.
