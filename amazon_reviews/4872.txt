Easy Peasy
I chose this after reviewing a number of different products. One of the selling points was the Lifetime Replacement Warranty but the number of positive reviews I'd read here on Amazon as well as on other sites. That's not to say I didn't just ignore the not-so-positive reviews but all things being equal, a Lifetime Replacement goes a long way to mitigating a lot of the negatives I've read. When I received this I found the instructions easy peasy to follow. The video tutorial was a bonus and confirmed what I thought I'd be doing. I installed the screen guard without any issues first pop (hint: do a dry run before you pull any tabs) and before I knew it I had a well installed screen guard. Not overly sure if it's a placebo effect but I also believe my phone has become a little more responsive since I've installed this as well. I'd recommend this to anybody who believes they're confident enough to install this and, obviously, Galaxy S3 owners :)
