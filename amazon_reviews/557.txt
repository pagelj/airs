Outstanding Camera - IT Support was very helpful
I bought this camera to monitor my puppy who had a seizure.  I tried setting it up but was not successful so I called the Foscam IT support  and they were instrumental in setting it up.  Also, I got the FOSCAM pro iphone APP.  I wasn't successful in setting it up so I once again called the FOSCAM IT support and they set it up for me.  I am loving this camera and will be purchasing others.  I fully recommend this along with the FOSCAL pro APP.
