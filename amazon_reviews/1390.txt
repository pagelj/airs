Doesn't fit Coby 7" Tablet
The case is nice looking, but does not fit my purposes. I have contacted the company and will see what fix they have. However I found that bending the hooks still did not work to secure my tablet. Hmmmm... suggestions anyone? Overall... not happy that my tablet does not fit in the case... REVIEW UPDATE 1/18/2012I contacted the company and informed them of the issue. I still think you should know that the case does not fit the COBY snugly, but the company is very nice to deal with and very accomodating. They were very speedy with their response and this is what they said:Thank you for your business. Sincerely sorry for the problem, for this case, we afraid there is something wrong between the product and the website, for the problem,we will look into the matter. Could you mind take a photo to us, so that we can report to our supervisor. And in order to show our sincerelyand sorry for you, we would like refund you partial cost--12 USD and . you needn't send the wrong item back.  Maybe you can hold it or give someothers as a gift, it will be more better than ship it back, at least, the shipping cost is unworthy! Hope you can accept our suggestion  We apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for your kindness and understanding! Looking forward to your early reply.
