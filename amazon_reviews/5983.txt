Rapid Rate Really Works with Optimus V
I use this with my Optimus V and it works flawlessly. It also seems to charge much quicker that the older charger I had in my car. This is an AUTHENTIC Motorola charger not a piece of junk. I would suggest buying it from AMAZON so you can get the Prime shipping. Also I believe that others have mentioned that you might not get the charger pictured if you don't order from Amazon. comThe blue light I actually enjoy. It lights up my car with ambient light, so I don't have to turn on the interior lights to see around. Don't get me wrong, it won't interfere with your driving, etc... Buy it and keep it there in the car. This is a true top quality $30 charger at extremely low price. Buy it!
