Xbox 360+Xbox 360 HD-DVD player+Playstation 3 is better than the Dual HD-dvd/Blu-Ray
Let me admit, when I heard about the new Dual Blu-ray/HD-DVD player, I was glad that the format war(from my perspective) would be over since I could purchase any HD movie and not be afraid that the format will tank and would have to rebuy the movie on the other format. But since I am an avid gamer, I had already purchased an Xbox 360 before that and was considering my options. I had already paid $400 for the 360, and another $200 would be $600 for the 360+hd dvd add on. And to play blu ray movies, $600 for the PS3. Now that is $1200, and the dual format blu-ray+hd dvd is $1200. I would think that one would take the Xbox 360+360 hd-dvd player+PS3 over the dual format player because you are getting more for your money. You get games, blu-ray and hd-dvds vs. blu-ray movies and hd-dvds WITHOUT the interactive menu features. That means on the dual format it will act like a dvd and to select scenes you will have to go back to the main menu. I am a true av fan and want the best from my technologies. With that said, I am a proud owner of a 360+360 hd-dvd and a PS3(60gb) and it is the greatest AV experience u will ever have. 'nuff said.
