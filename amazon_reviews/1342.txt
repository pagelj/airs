Savings on Sony CD Player CE 500
I had looked every place in my area to purchase a CD player that would hold 5 CDs and the only place I could locate one was at Best Buy.  The price was $149.95 + 6% sales tax.  This unit was a Sony CE500 and the same model I purchased from Amazon for $115.44.  Thus I saved $43.50 and received the new unit in 3 or 4 days. It was extremely well packed and operates very well. I will always check Amazon before I buy locally in the future.
