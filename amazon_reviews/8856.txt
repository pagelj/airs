I am not sure all of the love/hate reviews of coffee makers but I needed something to replace my broken Mr. Coffee and like my other Cuisinart appliances. All in all this is a good coffee maker. It is quiet, easy to use, and makes great tasting coffee. There are a few things I don't like (I will list those first since that is what people seem to go for):1. it is really tall. if you are short or are putting it on a tall counter it could be a problem to fill2. no water level indicator except by peeking in the top (which is marked like a pool) corner, I use the carafe3. caraffe lid snaps on with plastic tangs, they look like they will break off, we will seeand now the good:1. comes with reusable filter and 4x paper #4 cone2. dishwasher safe parts (all parts that touch coffee remove), easy to clean surfaces3. makes coffee FAST and quiet, beeps are very quiet4. comes out HOT and has a 1-4 cups SUPERHOT mode, 3 settings for warmer plate5. definitely more rugged than my previous Mr. Coffee6. auto on is perfect except for #3 below7. coffee tastes great! if you don't like it, its your blend/grind!8. Easy to use! and the so-so:1. instructions say to run water to prep. I would wash all the parts first (including gold filter). There was a funny taste the first few times I used it2. can't turn off beeps3. would have liked to have multiple auto-on settings, but resetting the timer is easy4. price, a little spendy for a coffee machine. I think the "retro metal styling" is a large part of it. it does look nice though. There you go. I have been making coffee nonstop for a couple of months, and got it from Amazon. I highly recommend it.
