Camera designed for underwater
The camera is larger and heavier than a typical digital camera with the same or better picture taking capabilities. It survived rain and saltwater diving as advertized. What I was not prepared for was the decrease in sharpness in picture quality. The lens does not telescope away from the body of the camera and aparently that is needed to get as clear a picture as most of us have come to expect from today's point and shoot digital cameras. So bottom line is its highest and best use is taking pictures underwater.
