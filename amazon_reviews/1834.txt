Love Skip Hop Products
This backpack is the perfect size for our Preschoolers. We have the monkey and the dog backpacks and love them. They hold up to being played with every day basically. They hold a change of clothes, snack, and a few toys. Of course they are totally adorable.. to watch our little boys walk away with these backpacks on is just too cute. Overall, they work great, hold up well, and I think Skip hop toys and products are made well.
