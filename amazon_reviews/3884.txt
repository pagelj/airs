Great phone!
I've been patiently waiting for this phone's release and I'm so glad that I wasn't impatient and bought the s3 instead.  I'm still learning the ins and outs of the phone, but so far the picture quality is stellar, it's fast (incredibly so) and even the sound quality is great!  I previously owned a Motorola Droid 3, so I'm having to get used to a touch screen keyboard, but even when you're blatantly spelling a word wrong (because you're hitting the wrong key) it assumes variations of the word you're typing and you can just select that.  I've noticed it also assumes words based on the content of your message so far. The only complaint I have deals not with the phone, nor Verizon, but with Amazon.  Amazon doesn't explicitly tell you the phone does not come with a SIM card (at least not that I could find).  Having not had a phone for a while that required a SIM card, I figured this was something that would come with the phone automatically.  But, I learned from Verizon that third-party sellers (I don't know if it's all) do not ship the SIM card.  However, it's an easy problem to fix if you have a Verizon store nearby.  You can get the SIM card at no cost.
