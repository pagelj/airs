very pleased with the camera bag
I was very pleased with the back pack style camera bag. I have small children, so for me it is very easy to put it on my back and still have my hands free. I was able to move dividers to make all my lenses fit. My camera stays put and is well protected. I like to leave a lens on my camera body for those times when you need to grab your camera for a quick shot. I have the Canon 40D and it fit very well in the case.
