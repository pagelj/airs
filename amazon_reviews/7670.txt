It's okay, I guess
It somehow manages to be slim and bulky at the same time. The thick frame gives it a sturdy shape, at the cost of flexibility and space. You might be able to carry a laptop and 2-ish textbooks, dog-earing most of the corners. Also, the wide, bulky straps are well padded but sit very uncomfortably on the shoulders. Also, the ungodly amount of pockets inside of pockets with pockets will annoy you.
