TERRIFIC "Crichton Like" Sci Fi
I loved this book.  It's genetics based intrigue was right up my alley.  I recently got a family DNA test back and found out I too am 4% Neanderthal.  I was reading the book at the time I got the test info... too weird.  I'm sure my employees will think that explains everything!  This novel has characters I cared about and a plot that was never boring.  I liked how it jumped back and forth in time and location finally bringing them all together at the end.  Thank you A. G. Riddle!  I'm sick but recovering and this book made it so much easier!!!
