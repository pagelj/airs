Good value, not great
I purchased the FI8910W (in black) and have had it setup indoor for about a week:Device ID  000DC5D65545Device Firmware Version  11.22.2.38Device Embeded Web UI Version  2.4.10.1Pros:* Pan/Tilt (my first PT cam), adjustable speed, quiet* Built-in web server (convenient, but not the greatest UI)* Small and unobtrusive design* Two-way audio (with built-in mic and speaker)* Night-vision with decent IR LEDs and IR-cut filter (for daytime)* Price ($95 with foscam. us discount code "WIFI1001")* Infinite focus* Decent low-light performance* Good color saturationCons:* 640x480 max resolution (maxing out at about 6fps)* MJPEG video only (not H.264), which is likely limiting the potential frame-rate (fps) over WiFi* Lack of anti-aliasing* No PoE support* Serious background noise in audio input (microphone)* Bad/scratchy audio output (speaker)* Two-way audio (talk-back) does not work reliably over the Internet at all* Will toggle IR LEDs/Cut-Filter on/off frequently when ambient lighting changes rapidlyYou can see a sample picture from this camera (and side-by-side comparison with some other cameras) at [...]I'm using Blue Iris Web/Security Camera Software with a variety of different camera types and brands and very happy with it (the software, not included with this camera).-Rob
