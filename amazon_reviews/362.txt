A Refreshing New Take
The idea of Earth falling into a dystopian state has been rehashed so many times that it has long since ceased to stand on its own as an element of curious science fiction.  These books, therefore, could not rely alone on the premise of a post-nuclear apocalypse to provide it with substance and intrigue.  What was the most fascinating aspect of these books was the world-building.  Months after having read the books I can conjure in my mind scenes of the silos so detailed that I can smell the acrid odor of worn, metal handrails mixed with fresh soil and mechanics grease.  I can hear the echos of familiar laughs, cries, and the mundane chatter that make up any human microcosm. I felt that the characters were all very believable, and many of them were relatable (an essential component of storytelling sorely lacking from many works of fiction I've come across lately).  While the seeming romantic relationship between the two main characters felt a little forced, or perhaps too juvenile for their respective ages, the relationships between friends and colleagues were so realistic that I was immersed in their interactions.  I'm not sure how all of this was transcribed with often frightening lucidity, but rest assured there was no listing ad nauseam of nouns and adjectives. For me, this was a story about how strongly humans cling to the status quo as a mechanism for survival and stability.  Our window into this study is through a microscope poised over a petri dish.  What was most compelling, however, was the vivid description of the dish and the complexity of its residents.
