Would be great if it stayed powered on.
After owning this player two days, I'll have to deem it a mixed review.  I found the interface more straightforward then that of my Samsung Smart TV.  It is much easier to search for You Tube videos, and recently watched ones are saved automatically, so you don't have to search for them again.  My first experience watching a movie was actually a DVD: Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  The quality was excellent with the upconverted resolution.  There were funny details in the film I had never noticed before on my older DVD Player.  The brightness and clarity were superb.  My next experience was the issue.  I attempted to play a Blu-Ray disc: Lion King - Second Screen version, for use with the I-Pad.  As other reviews online have stated, the player simply turned off after about 15-20 minutes or so.  I turned the power back on, re-synched the I-Pad, only to repeat the process.  And this occurred in different parts of the movie, so it was not the disc. Upon powering up the player, a notice is given stating that a firmware update is available.  However, it states that additional memory is required to do so; I assume via the USB port.  However, I find it silly for me to have to invest in extra memory to update Sony's dysfunctional firmware.  Perhaps, there is some fix to this problem, but I am tempted to just return this player.  I originally purchased it due to its compact size, but it's not worth it if you can play all of your movies.
