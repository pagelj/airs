This coffee maker is excellent! Being able to brew a whole pot or just a single pot is a feature I can't see myself living without in the future. The single brew side is awesome because you don't have to purchase expensive cups or pouches. I love being able to use my own personal favorite, not being limited to the flavors of K-Cups. The only thing I wish this coffee maker had was a reusable gold filter bag on the carafe side... Although, there are a lot of people that believe that you will indeed get a better brew using paper filters because they filter out the oils in the coffee. Overall, this is my favorite coffee maker I have ever owned. If you were considering a Keurig, DONT, this is the coffee maker for you!
