Small backpack for day use
This one is smaller than it looks. So before buying, be sure to look at the dimensions. I like the color of it though. Pleasing to the eyes. The strap feels good on my shoulders, but the material of the backpack itself feels a bit thin. No that it is a problem as long as it can hold all that I can pack into it. I have been using it as a hiking backpack.
