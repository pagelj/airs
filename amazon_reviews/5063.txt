Piece o' Crap
This toaster is a piece o' crap. Do not buy it. There are so many other choices out there. I'm going shopping for one right now. Top 5 complaints:- one of the slice units does not engage when depressed now! You have to stand there like an idiot and hold it down while it toasts to an imperfect state (have used about 6 times).- toast is unevenly toasted, even on the same piece of toast- toast is lukewarm when it pops up- browning controls don't behave consistently- you know, the toaster doesn't even look that attractiveDumb toaster. Whack it with a racket.
