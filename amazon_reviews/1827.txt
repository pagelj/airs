LG BD670 What a looser
Avoid this at all costs.  Totally unable to download updates wirelessly and why else do you buy a wifi unit - so you don'thave to hard wire it.  A total waste of time and money.  Out of the box it required an update that it couldn't download.  No way to connect with NetFlix without the update so the wireless function was worthless.  Returned for a Panasonic model that works flawlessly.
