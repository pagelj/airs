so nice
and convienent to have a long long cord to use.  Being tied to the wall...2 feet from the wall sucks.  Should be standard with each iPhone/iPod/iPad purchase.  Price is decent so when it stops working in 6 to 8 months I won't feel cheated.  I'm on my second or third set of these in the last 3 years.
