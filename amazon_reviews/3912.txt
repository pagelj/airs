Its a pretty decent bag
I had to buy a bag for my first DSLR camera and something compact... so I decided to go for this. There is one main compartment to keep the camera with a bigger lens attached I dont, (no additional compartment or anything inside it. I think its little waste of space they could have made better use of space in main compartment. However, over all its a pretty decent bad for the price.
