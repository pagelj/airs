things that i wish i had known about this knife set:1) the steak knives ARE NOT SERRATED. I cant recall ever using non-serrated steak knives, and what's more this set does not come with a serrated knife besides the bread knife, which is not proper for cutting, for instance, tomatoes.2) the 8-inch utility knife, paring knife, and 8 steak knives all have a lip on the handle that sticks out forwards further than the blade.3) the knife block is not the one shown in this product picture. it is black, rather than wood. it has extra slots when filled, and looks kinda cheap.4) a chefs knife is typically a little wider (from the blade, to the back) than this one but that's mostly a subtle preference. however...5) the santoku knife is excellent. I learned to cook using them, and I'm glad to see that they are being put into typical knife sets these days.
