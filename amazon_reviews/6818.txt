Bought Para Cord
The cord I received was not cut well at all. Right off the bat I had to easily sacrifice 2 feet in order to properly prevent it from fraying. Also, I found a few cuts in the sheath of the rope around it. As I bought it for knot tying practice, it is ok. But I was going to actually use it for working loads, I would return it immediately. Also, it is some of the most expensive stuff I could find, so I thought I was getting the best.
