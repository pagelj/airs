Great phone
I already have 2 weeks using this phone and the only thing I can say it's "amazing", very light weight and thin, the resolution/size of the AMOLED display is great, very very good camera, windows 7 mango in gorgeous and very intuitive (it's looks better than any android version that I have used and I haven't had any single "frozen" screen or software lag since I first started it), apps and games are high quality. The only "not good" thing about this phone is the battery life, it last 1.5 days with full charge, but if you don't required extended battery life this phone will be for you.
