Gave my laptop a 2nd life
I've had my laptop for 3 years and could not understand why the battery only lasted 90 minutes (if I was lucky) when I disconnected it from the battery pack. I'm not a tech person so it never occurred to me that there would be an issue with the battery since my laptop, in my opinion, is fairly new. So for the last year I've been changed to my desk if I wanted to use my laptop for an extended amount of time. Finally, I decided that maybe it's the battery stupid. And it was. D'oh! The laptop battery arrived quickly and not in complicated packaging. Once I replaced my old battery with the new one, I had to charge it for a bit. Once at full charge, I was sitting on the ouch, using my laptop for almost 4 hours. Woo hoo!!! I was on the verge of spending 500+ dollars on a new laptop thinking my current one was about to die. So happy I didn't. Definitely worth the $20+ dollars.
