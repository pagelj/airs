ITS WHITE
alright so this is a really good computer. random glitches but all and all its pretty good. it sometimes disconnects from wifi. but when u have it set as autoconnect. it pretty much takes that issue away. the touch pad will randomly quit working with gestures. and how i fix that is restart the computer until i find a different way that works. but it was only $429 compared to others thats cheap. but still $429 is still alot of money. i expected more out of this computer because it is asus. this would of gotten a higher rating if it was a cheap brand because thats all you would expect from that brand.
