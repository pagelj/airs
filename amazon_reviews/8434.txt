After having done much research for a carafe type coffee maker and reading all sorts of reviews I decided to purchase this machine. I am very pleased with this machine. I like that the basket that holds the filter basket is insulated to help keep the coffee hot while brewing. And it also comes apart easily for cleaning. The coffee brews much hotter than my previous carafe style makers yet it isn't quite as hot as I prefer as I like it Dunkin Donuts hot, yet I'm fine with how hot it is. It helps if the water is room temp before brewing and also if you preheat the carafe ahead of time. The cover to the carafe was hard to tighten/loosen at first but the more it was used it is fine now. I like that the carafe has a large opening as it makes it easier to clean. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend it for purchase. It cost more than some others but it came with free shipping so it really wasn't that much more than others I have purchased in the past. And it was delivered in a timely manner, matter of fact it showed up on a Friday when it was expected to be delivered on the following Monday.
