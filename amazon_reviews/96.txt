Great phone!
I've had this phone for a few months now.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention compared to the other phones out there (e. g. samsung galaxy, iphone 5).  I got my wife and iphone 5 and I think this phone blows it away! Pros:- Size.  It has a nice big screen (one of the main reasons I got it), but its surprisingly light, fits in my pants pocket, and is not too big to hold up as a phone to talk.- Great screen.  Nice large screen with nice colors and good contrast.- Plays smooth, sharp video.- Excellent call quality, whether it be from the handset or using the speaker.  No problem with dropped calls or bad call quality.- Fast 4G.  Where I live (Orange County, CA), Verizon 4G coverage is excellent.  Pages load fast.- Excellent Wifi.  Wifi is fast, and never drops while in my house.  My daughter's iphone 4s's drop the wifi signal every so often in the same house!- Android OS.  It comes with jelly bean.  The android os has come a long way and I must say is now equal to or even superior to IOS.  I have not had any problems with any of the features of this phone which speaks to the quality of the phone and the OS. I've also found features built into this phone that is not available natively to the iphone 5. Would've been nice if these were better:- Battery life is acceptable.  I use the phone throughout the day (email, fb, gps, calls, scramble, yahoo finance, sports scores, yelp, etc.), and the battery usually lasts till when I come home.- Video/still camera is pretty good for a phone.  Low light performance of the still camera leaves a bit to be desired though.- The flap that covers the usb port is a minor pain. Overall, love the phone.  Would've given it 5 stars if the battery life were better, or if the camera was superb!
