Very small laptop bag
Quality, price, and overall look are all average in comparison to any other laptop case. I would recommend this laptop case to anyone that simply wants to travel with the laptop and ONLY the laptop. The pocket for the laptop itself was fairly tight but still works just fine for my 15.6" Toshiba. However, do not purchase this case if you plan to carry any accessories. The only other pocket is in the front and I barely manage to fit the AC adapter in this pocket. When I want to take a backup battery, wireless mouse, and my cooling pad I have to stuff everything into a backpack... including the case logic laptop case. that kind of defeats the purpose of buying this product in my opinion.
