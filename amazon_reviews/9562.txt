So far, so good.
We haven't prepared anything really fancy or complicated yet.  Mostly baked and warmed bakery products (rolls, bread, etc.)  It's worked great for those - and did a really nice job on rewarming pizza.  We would definitely recommend the oven.  Now if the company will just get the cutting board back in stock.  Just wanted to update the review as of April 24, 2013.  Still love this oven and it's going strong.
