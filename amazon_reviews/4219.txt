Works
I was looking for a dvd player to connect to my old tv. This player had the old style connectors, rca/component, that I required and it played the video just fine.  I am upgrading to home theater style speaker system so that should improve the audio output as opposed to tv speakers. I do have a blue ray player and 24" led video monitor but lacked the sound system at purchase time. It was bought for a make do situation. I also use it in a small room. My price was lots cheaper than the current price!
