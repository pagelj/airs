Great camera with a small footprint
I swear by Canon cameras. This is my 5th.  I purchased this as a glove compartment camera, since I don't want to carry my T3 DSLR with me all the time and leave it in the car.  This isn't much larger than a pack of cigarettes and takes great pictures if there is adequate lighting.  I am also very pleased with the video quality.  I cannot attest to low light shooting as I have not tried that yet.  You won't be disappointed with this camera!
