A solid point-and-shoot
When I decided I wanted (read: needed) a new camera this year, I obsessively researched it like I do most things.  Being a poor camera nerd, I decided that I wanted to stay in this price point so I could save up for an SLR in a couple of years.  This camera is a fabulous placeholder, and it's the best image quality I've seen in a point and shoot for this price. Yes, there is some turn around time between shots, and yes it runs on AA batteries (although for me this isn't really a con since I invested in some NiMH rechargeables and they've been doing a great job), but if you're like me and your bottom line is image quality, then I really don't think you can do much better for the same amount of money. I live out in New Mexico and take a lot of photos outside, so I haven't played with the flash much, but without it the camera has done a really great job with direct lighting, indirect lighting, sunset colors, etc.  I've printed some pretty nice 11x14 posters (and the printing sites say I could take it up to 12x18 without adverse effects), so the 12 megapixels is working out pretty well. This isn't an SLR, but it's solid image quality at a very fair price, and honestly, I wouldn't want to spend too much more than this on something that doesn't give you the absolute manual controls of an SLR.  Highly recommended.
