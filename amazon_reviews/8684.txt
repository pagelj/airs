Great Value
This is a nice BD Player and one of the fastest in terms of disc loading. I was skeptical initially about the netflix issues that have been reported by numerous users. However, Amazon offered a great price and I couldn't resist. It was quickly shipped and arrived in a perfect condition. Having used it for over a month now, I can say that I haven't faced any Netflix issues that people reported here. Netflix works fine (no blinking,black screens) and we watch it everyday. I watch Netflix from my iPod as well and when I go back to Blu-ray player, it picks up all the history properly. I am running the latest firmware. The player is connected to internet over my wi-fi. The remote is decent. Dedicated button for netflix is nice. They have an iPod app too which allows all the functionality of the remote. The Vierra Cast button is positioned at a awkward place though and I end up pressing it many times instead of up arrow. The player starts up quickly and the interface is generally very fast and responsive. The Blu-ray quality is good. It is very quick in forward/rewind operations. All in all a good player and highly recommended.
