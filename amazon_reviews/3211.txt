It'd be perfect if only it would stick all the time!
Everything else about this product is good to great.  The size, device grip and ability to adjust the angle are perfect.  It unfortunately just doesn't stick to the dash consistently, and I can't quite figure out why. I have gone on a 100+ mile trip where it stayed in place the entire time, and on a short trip downtown where it came loose in 5 minutes. Maybe it is dependent on the temperature or moisture in the air?? Due to the fact that you have a load-bearing side when a device is in it, the suction is always under pressure to lift on one side when in use.  I'm trying to make it work for now but am still looking for the perfect mount...
