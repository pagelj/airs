Looking forward to the 3rd book
Loved it Loved it.... the story was exciting and I could not put the book down.  The character of Jesse was complex.  His life was so crazy troubled.  Ava and Jesse's relationship was a difficult one.  Each ones lives were different but entwined tightly.  I would recommend this book if you liked fifty shades.
