Upon arrival, the lid would not close all of the way.  The sensor works great in terms of it opening, but when it goes to close it stops short.  I have had to press the "close" button manually to get it to close.  Sometimes, it will close all of the way after several manual pushes on the top of the lid when it attempts to close on its own.  In addition, the "deodorizer" part of it is essentially useless.  It has not made a difference.  I do, however, like the fact that you can push the "open" button on it and it will stay open until you press "close."  This makes it much easier for when you are doing food prep in the kitchen. iTouchless Deodorizer Filtered Infrared Sensor Automatic Touchless Trash Can, 13 Gallon, Stainless-Steel
