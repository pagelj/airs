Great!
I got mine a few days ago, and I have to say it actually works! Now I can keep nosey people off my phone when I am texting. The only thing wrong is the color, it does make my white iPhone 4S look like the black one, but I don't care. It still protects my screen and give me some privacy. I would recommend it
