I like the look, the ease of cleaning, and the fact that it does everything I need a microwave to do without taking up much countertop space.  The only drawback is that the interior is so small I sometimes "bump" coffee cups trying to put them in for re-heating, spilling liquid that drips straight down to the control panel.  After having a full size microwave, this one takes some getting adjusting on my part!  I gave it 4 stars because I can't heat pancake syrup in it, the bottles are too tall.  All other things I use it for, such as making popcorn, melting butter, reheating left-overs, etc., are just fine.
