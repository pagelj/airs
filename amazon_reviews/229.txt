Cheap yes, great sound- no
I purchased these based on 386 customer reviews. A 4.5 star quality sound product these are not. The sound does not have much depth or richness and reminded me of the way headphones sounded 5 years ago. I was expecting more because many of the reviews stated that the headphones were "great" despite the low price.
