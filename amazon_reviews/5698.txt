This is not a technical review, but all of the stuff that came with hoses and such fit and work well. If you are are the fence about getting this, we were nervous too, but go for it! Rest assured this little thing has made our quality of life just a wee bit better. It is tiny enough to fit in a small closet when not in use and has wheels; wheels should be on everything! It washes well and the spin cycle means business. Overall wished we had bought this years ago, it is appliance love.
