great looking back pack, for a great piece!
This bag was exactly what I was looking for. I got this bad for my girlfriend and she loves the color and it sure can hold a lot.  The shipping was really fast and the customer service was awesome, they answered all my questions and concerns.  I would really recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great looking bag with lots of spaces for books and binders.
