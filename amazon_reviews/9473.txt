Great Service - Wrong Color
I appreciate the fact that mistakes are sometimes made, but to order a black IPad Tablet and have white one arrive makes one wonder how well the quality control system works.  The distributor provided a smart cover to atone for the mistake.  That was appreciated, but cannot dispel the disappointment in receiving the wrong product.
