Only protect first element but it is cheap
Got this one for my very entry level Nikon D40's kit lens. Frankly I regret that I should ignore the "brand name" of this filter, since it is neither well designed or well built. It has NO coating, and noticeably reduces resolution/contrast. However, for a $5 protector it does its job. So I only recommend it to those need a really cheap glass to protect a cheap lens, and you may want to dismount it when indoor or any chances you feel there is no danger of damaging your lens.
