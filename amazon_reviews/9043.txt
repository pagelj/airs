Ordered item labeled as "Ships from and sold by Amazon" and received item that must have been a customer return; scrub pads were worn and box was obviously re-sealed.  Plastic latches that hold on the nozzle were missing, so I had to duct-tape it on. Unless I accidentally ordered the 'Amazon Warehouse Used but Like-New' version of this product, it is not acceptable to order a new retail product and receive a return or a refurb!
