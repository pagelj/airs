This toaster must be set on the lightest setting in order not to burn. I thought this toaster would be better than most based on the price.  Save your money and buy an old toaster off of ebay. Buy one made when USA citizens designed and manufactured toasters. Nobody nowadays  can make a simple functional toaster. The engineers  must all have  phd's.
