I purchased this vacuum after spending a lot of time looking at product reviews on Amazon and other places.  Some vacuums were significantly more money but I just didn't see a benefit or quality improvement.  I did purchase this vacuum since it could be adjusted for hardwood floors and to help me deal with cat hair.  Overall it has been great.  The only ask I would have is adding another extension tube so that it makes it easier to use the attachments (this has been mentioned in other reviews as well).
