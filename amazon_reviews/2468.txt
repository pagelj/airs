We moved to a small apartment and needed the undersink space for storage.  This can looks nice in the hallway.  In addition, there are no finger print issues as the can opens automatically.  We love this trash can!  It holds a fair amount of recyclables, a full bag of trash.  It is easy to load and unload, and gives us a chuckle every time we run our hand over it to open it up. You will be pleased with this product.  We have had it for several weeks, and are still so pleased.  Who knew you could love a trash can!
