Nikon 18-105
I have a Nikon DX 40X and take a lot of pictures.  I searched Amazon looking for the Nikon 18mm-105mm zoom lens which usually cost about $400 and found one that was the lowiest price, but seller stated, "like new". Cost me a little over $200. Turns out it was new and basically never used.  Found it to be a wonderful purchase, Thanks to Amazon for great deals. Search Amazon. com Nikon LensTommy Bondurant, Memphis
