This vacuum is not designed well for wood floors/ linoleum. If your floors are not perfectly level, the plastic piece on the bottom will rub your floors. This vacuum did some damage to my floors and dyson would not do anything about it. They said the vacuum was "mechanically working" and that I ran over "grit" to do that damage to my floors. They wouldn't give me my money back. They have the worst customer service. They didn't care that I couldn't use it in my house. They didn't disclose that you need to have level floors - they just said that they could see it rubbing the floors if you have uneven floors.
