Great handbag for adults
Been looking for a Hello Kitty handbag for awhile now. Finally, found one that is not so kiddish and so pink. Great for an all day outing and year round. Bag does have a plastic smell, but just air it out for like 2 days or so and it should get rid of the smell. Large enough to carry a lot of stuff, but not super large like a diaper bag. =) This seller was nice enough to send me iPhone stickers for the middle button. Good I can put them to use. Would be better if it has another small zip on the inside, instead of just one. I like to hide things. Handle does feel a little flimsy, so I hope it doesn't break off. Overall, it's cute and for the price, it's worth it. And fast delivery from China, which I didn't know. Buy it only took a week from ordering to my mailbox, so, very satisfied.
