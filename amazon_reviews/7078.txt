nice fit for Acer Aspire One 11.6" notebook.
Nice product and does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It is a nice slim sleeve that allows for simple protection when my notebook is placed in my briefcase or hand bag.  It won't protect well from a drop, but it isn't intended to.  Does a good job for protecting from bumps and scratches when in another bag.
