Digitizer Problem
All the pieces came as stated which was great, but the actual digitizer seemed to have a short.  Nonetheless, the phone doesn't know where I am touching anymore.  I contacted Zeetron and was told to contact Amazon and turns out they can not replace the damaged part, but could reimburse me if I sent it back.  I am going to try one more time with another company and see how that goes before buying a new phone... the process isn't that bad and the price is worth another go :-)
