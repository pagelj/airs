It works!!
I purchased this model to replace TWO LG610's.  I had the 610 for a month and it had a lot of issues, so I replaced it for another, which had the same issues.  My parents had gotten the same LG player and theirs, too, was exchanged for the Panasonic DMPBDT210.  We have both had the Panasonic players for nearly two months now.  While it seems like these days it is hit or miss with BD players, so far the Panasonic DMPBDT210 has worked amazingly and so does the one my parents have.  While I could go on about the model, looking at the 200+ 5 star reviews pretty much says it all.  Compare it to the LG360 reviews and, well, you get my point.  And I could write a lengthy review, which most often times I do, but other reviewers have written amazing reviews about this player already, so I will not. I am just happy that, for now, it works perfectly.  Who knows in a few months, but I am hoping it will continue the way it has thus far.  And I am even more thrilled about the Panasonic player working so well, because each time the LG messed up (daily, by the way), it was me who had to run over to my parents' home to fix it!
