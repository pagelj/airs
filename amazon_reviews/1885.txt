We got this to use in our 32 ft. motorhome.  It does the job on the small carpet areas and gets in between the furniture easily with its small head.  I use a small brush to remove the dust and fuzz from the catcher area when I empty it. This doesn't take much storage space which was important to us. Minor complaint: the catch that slides up and down to remove and replace the dust catching chamber is difficult to move.
