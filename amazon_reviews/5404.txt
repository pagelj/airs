Doesn't play new movies
This machine won't play some of my new 3D movies (Spider-Man, Underworld Awakenings - both Sony studios).  I was told I would have to wait 6 months to a year to have the firmware updated before my movies would work.  I hate buying new movies and then having to wait a year before I can watch them.  They work on my PS3 so I recommend skipping the Samsung and going for a Sony or don't plan on watching new Blurays for a year.
