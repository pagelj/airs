I bought this to replace our old toaster that was never very good.  It took forever to toast.  This little gem toasts very fast.  It is quite powerful and for such a reasonable price!! It's good looking too!  One hint, start with a lower setting.  I almost burnt my first piece of egg bread on the #6 setting.  I was used to a much less powerful toaster.  Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
