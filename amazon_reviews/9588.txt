Roomy for a good price, good for the older "kid" at college
I use this book bag at college. I'm generally carrying between 2-4 textbooks plus a binder or two. Some days I'll throw in my laptop to haul around. This bag easily holds all of it as well as the small things. I've got my cup holder on the side for my coffee and my front pockets are perfect for pencils/calculator/girl stuff without it all getting mixed up. It took me a good while to find a book bag that didn't scream out "I'M STILL 16!!" (I'm 25 and it seemed difficult) and this is the one I chose. The color is a bit bold but it's I enjoy it; it was pretty much this, purple or black and hideous. The straps are very thick so they don't press into my shoulders when I have to lug around all my school gear. I'm a short person, so the straps are set to be small; this presents a weird problem putting the book bag on and I sometimes I can't bend my arm the right way to get the second strap on. It almost seems like the bag's been awkwardly sewn onto the bag but I honestly don't know how else it'd be attached. I suppose that's my only small complaint.
