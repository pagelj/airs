Sci-Fi Fans can rejoice
Somehow I missed this when it aired on TV so I am very very happy to have got this on DVD. The stories should appeal to anyone who is a Sci-Fi fan since they are well written, thought-provoking, well acted, and have excellent special effects. Indeed, you will probably recognize many of the actors/actresses since the producers apparently weren't cheap in producing this wonderful mini-series. One other thing that I found to be a pleasant surprise is that the video quality is as good as I have ever seen on a standard DVD. I am using an upscaling DVD player for playback on a 42inch HDTV. The picture looks almost blu-ray quality! I can't recommend this highly enough. If I didn't already have this, It is one that I feel I would just have to get!
