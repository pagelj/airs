DON'T hesitate to grab this bag!
Bought the Designer Inspired London Tote in Grey and WAS NOT disappointed! It's darker than what it appears in the photos, but I think that makes it even more chic. The hardware looks great, and it's perfectly oversized. I've received numerous compliments on this bag, and even more envious stares. Definately resembles the Hermes Birkin, and for the price it's not to be passed up. Ordering this in the orange now, may even grab the navy blue...
