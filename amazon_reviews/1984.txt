Going back pack
Overall, the backpack is laid out very well and makes good use of space. The TSA friendly laptop pocket is great and there's another pocket up front for your tablet. The problem I have and the reason it's going back is because the loop strap doesn't fit around my luggage handles. I've tried it on three different suitcases and the strap is too narrow.
