Best camera for close face shots and low light.
This  is the best camera I have ever worked with. I find this camera more suited for low-light and close-ups than the more popular and expensive DSLRs. Remember good photos are dependent on the photographer not the camera, just the same as paint on canvas. For a quick fix to soften light on the go, take a piece of paper about 3"x3" roll it into a cone and hold it around the flash to diffuse; that helps tremendously when you have no other lighting options.
