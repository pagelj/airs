With nearly 250 reviews earning an average of nearly 5 stars, I have to agree with all the satisfied customers that this toaster is an excellent device for both bread and egg cooking! My roommates owned one and once I learned how to use it, I made use of it often.  They joked how I would end up buying one of my own when I moved out and it arrived in the mail a few days ago. =)A tip to keep in mind is to always put some non-stick cooking spray in the mini frying pan otherwise the egg will stick. To summarize a few key points made by many other reviewers, it easily poaches and hard boils eggs in a variety of softness levels.  The toaster works as expected and the toaster overall is an easy clean.  The only exception to this is the heating plate under the egg pan.  Using tap water will develop some mineral deposits or hard water stains over time.  It doesn't detract from the functionality of the product but defiantly pulls it away from looking new or clean. Overall, with its recent price drop from $50 to $30 it is a competitive option against most other 2 slice toasters.  I think you will be happy with the convenience and nifty feature set of this toaster.
