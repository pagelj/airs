This product worked well -- and the extra battery is a nice plus.  Hint: Try to remember to regularly check and empty the cannister and inspect the brush area for twisted string/hair.  When you sense a loss of suction power, insert the extra battery (which comes with the unit).  I am very satisfied with this purchase so far.
