Fits iPad
I got this to carry my new iPad.  I'd also gotten a plastic back cover for the iPad, which made it not fit into the very tight iPad cases I found at the Apple store.  The iPad fits very well inside this bag, with the outside pocket to hold the charger. Highly recommended, and great quality for the price. When shopping, I showed several to my wife--this she gave thumbs up since it looks like a small laptop bag, and not a purse :)
