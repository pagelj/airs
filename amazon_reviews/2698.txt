Original Sci-fi premise & solid writing, but the ending is just a new start
I'm very conflicted about how to review this book. I won't rehash the plot, since there are so many other reviews that do that, but I would say that the Science Fiction part of the book is some of the best I've read lately. It takes a very solid and interesting idea, that is both plausible and has a myriad of implications, and plays many of those implications out in a fascinating way. In fact, if the plot development was as solid as the premise, this would be one of the few five star ratings I've given out in a while. The story is told from multiple viewpoints that happen simultaneously, moving forward in slow increments as each the author rotates through the group in overlapping progressing time periods. At first I really enjoyed this method of storytelling as it drew me in and left me guessing about what was really happening. However, about midway through, I became impatient with it and was ready for the plot to move faster. At the end of the book answers do start to come faster, and they are satisfying and sometimes unexpected. My biggest problem though is that after all that round robin character development and some great twists based on the excellent premise, the ending completely leaves you hanging. Not cliffhanger hanging, but "I'll just stop here and leave the rest for the next book" hanging. I'm not sure if the author will continue the series, but he left plenty of room to do so - really too much room for this book to wrap up properly. It's one of those kind of endings, I suppose, where you decide what happens in the end. Nonetheless, this book is a thought provoking and interesting read. Disclosure - I received a free review copy of this book.
