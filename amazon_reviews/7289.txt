I don't think you can find a better vacuum for the price. And I am sure you can spend a lot more and not get a vacuum as good. I did a lot of research and the reviews for this vacuum were almost all really good. The one thing negative that I read was that it's not good for deep pile carpets but great on low to medium pile carpets (like we have). We have 4 dogs and even though we vacuumed daily before, it's amazing how much dog hair this picked up the first few times we used it. I bought the vacuum that included the extra caddy. I didn't know that it was something we really needed, but it's very nice for vacuuming out your car. I thought the vacuum seemed flimsy when I looked at it in the store, but it's not. It actually very sturdy and well constructed. I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good vacuum!
