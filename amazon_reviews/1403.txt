You Need to Read this Review !
I just purchased 2 of the Black Foscam FI8910W. PLEASE NOTE: These INDOOR CAMS WORK ON BOTH PC & MAC. They can be viewed on your LOCAL network or REMOTELY! When I first opened the packages both included CD's were not recognized by my mac - BUT - I called the Telephone Support Number on the back page of the included quick installation guide and got a tech support person almost immediately ! He needed me to download app so he could control my computer. (BTW this app to control my computer can be deleted once the session is over, just check your download folder.) Anyways this guy was super knowledgeable about my mac, so I'm sure he is super super knowlegeable about your PC. The Clarity of the pics are quite good. The pan and tilt are the best I've seen. The price is amazing ($100 each), seeing as how I also own 2 sharx outdoor cams (that don't pan or tilt that I paid at least $250 for.) I will continue my review after I get to know these cameras good or bad.
