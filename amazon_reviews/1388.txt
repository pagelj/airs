Great sound for such a little device!
My dad, and myself, love big sound! Loud sound! So he's been wanting to plug his phone into speakers for when he works outside in the yard (he's a mechanic). So far, I've been testing them here at home for him and they sound pretty loud enough! I'm enjoying them before he takes them to get all dirty at his work, haha.
