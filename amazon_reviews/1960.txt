Only good for one thing
I wish I had known before buying this thing that it wouldnt work on my phone. Like I can't just plug headphones in and listen, I actually have to have a set w/ mic built in or it won't work. Plus when I tried to use it with my friends mic I had to wiggle it around to get it to work right. Not the best investment, but good for the money.
