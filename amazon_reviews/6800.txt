"Kidnapped" meets "Starship Troopers"
Well written, solid overview of two young men coming of age, one inspired by the "glamor" of being a pirate, the other, a scholar who chose the military as his only option. The one becomes good enough, and considers good enough to be good enough - for a pirate. The scholar undertakes his own (internal) march upcountry, and, mastering the balance between disciplined initiative, and creative solutions. This book is very tightly written, and offers useful lessons in an area many young men find challenging, notably development of discipline, with a mature focus that addresses the larger needs of the polity. As well, if you are interested in learning to write useful YA military sci-fi, Kay offers a useful template.
