Barely survived the school year.
My boy started middle school and, because our schools have no lockers, the load this backpack had to handle was on the high stress-test end of the spectrum. On occasion, I'd catch him yanking it over street curbs from sidewalk level to street level, making me thing he did this a lot more when I wasn't looking.  He started using it around Oct 2012 and by end of May, the handle was on its last leg:  It would come right out of the pack if you tugged too hard.  The rest of the pack, including fabric, zipper and wheels were fine and could have gone another round, but as is, we cannot use it w/o the handle.  I'm betting if my girl used it, it may have lasted longer, but you never know.  She has been using her High Sierra wheeled pack since Jan 2011 and it's going strong.  I want to give this a 4 star but how can I when the handle came outâ€¦ I may dissect it this summer to see if I can fix the handle.
