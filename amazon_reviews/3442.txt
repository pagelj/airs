Best phone Ive ever owned
I have had iphones to standerd UI phones, they all suited me quite well! But I decided to do this 30 dollar a month ( unlimted texting and data on a 4G network!) ! ITS AWESOME! Im saving so much money and the phone is great, its fast and the android experience is lifechanging! If you are looking for a new prepaid phone I highly recommend this phone, I am an avid electronics user and own things from laptops to a playstation vita, this is by far my favorite piece of technology! I have one tid bit, it gets a little warm but not too bad. BUY!
