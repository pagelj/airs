Clear Protection, but...
Got this screen protector to replace a more expensive one that got scratched by car key.  Applied it easily and the fit is good.  The protector is indeed HD Clear when initially applied.  The problem is that it's a fingerprint magnet (extremely inefficient if I have to keep wiping it down with a cloth).  I'm pretty disappointed since I was hoping for a clear protector that resists fingerprints (like my older, more expensive one).  I've ordered Tech Armor's Matte Anti-Fingerprint version.  Hopefully that will be the solution.
