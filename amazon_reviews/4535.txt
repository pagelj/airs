Useless WiFi
Looks like you get 10GB free on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY but NEVER rely on it. Wifi is useless until it syncs to g drive/picasa, dropbox and flickr. Canon is going extinct like polaroid/kodak for failing to stay up to date. I'm really about to just start using my cell phone and sell my camera. I get instant uploads to dropbox. Get the Canon PowerShot ELPH 310 HS instead. It's quite expensive right now because it is so much better.
