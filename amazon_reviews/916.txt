Goood as it said
I think it was thinner than the normal ipod touch screens more sensitive to touch but installed  and fit good ,no glue was given or 3m tack paper its just the screen nothing else. Just as shown, nothing else, i mean nothing. a little screen in a bubble wrap and a small box thats it.
