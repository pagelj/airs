Intermittent Lock-Ups. Returned.
I purchased this model to replace the Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-Ray player that failed on me only after 2 years. (no warranty support available after first year)The BD75 is aggressively priced and I felt it was a bargain- even without Amazon Video, HDMI component control or optical/coax digital audio out. Turns out you get what you pay for. In the week I've had the player, it's locked up on me three times on power-up. (with updated firmware) Totally unresponsive to button presses on the unit and remote. The only way to resolve is to completely unplug the power. And the lock-ups occurred twice while the disc was inserted, once while the tray was empty.  (it never locked up while playing, so I guess that's a plus)The rest of the player works fine and the Netflix support is well implemented. But diving into the back of the player to yank the power cord got old real fast. My last Panasonic disc player. A shame because I have Panny DVD players over a decade old that still work. (DVD-A110) But after my experience with the BD60 and the BD75, can't go there again.
