This is probably one of the greatest things I've ever bought. Don't be fooled because it's made of plastic. It's pretty sturdy. Well worth the money. I bought this with the Mini Spin Counter Dryer & it's a great combo. If it happens to break, I'm defiantly buying another one no matter what the cost. Pros: Light, compact, easy to use, saves a ton of money, portable, durable. Cons: Doesn't come with instructions to assemble (I just found it on Google; problem solved), I wish it told you how much detergent to add instead of guessing. I just add 1/3 cupful. Yes, there is a hand crank, but it's really not that bad.
