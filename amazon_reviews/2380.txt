Great Stand - filthy when it arrives though
This is a fantastic stand for the macbook pro. Nice packaging box too. However, it comes out of the box covered in factory filth. Hey guys, I'm spending all this money for a bit of aluminum and rubber the least you could do is have the darn thing wiped down and cleaned before it's inserted into the packaging. Don't make me clean something I just bought.
