I highly recommend this vacuum cleaner--particularly over the Black and Decker Pivot Vac.  I finally decided it was time to purchase a hand vac to conquer all of the little messes left by our dog, cat, and 11-month-old.  I couldn't decide between the Black and Decker Pivot Vac and this Eureka model (there are rave reviews for both), but I finally chose the Black and Decker since the Eureka was temporarily out of stock.  When the Black and Decker arrived, I charged it overnight as directed in the instructions, and then tried it on our stairs the next day.  The suction seemed okay at first, but it all but disappeared after vacuuming only four stairs (roughly five minutes)!!  I had read a few other reviews of the Black and Decker that warned of poor battery life, but I hoped those were just flukes.  Maybe so, but I had the same experience. I immediately ordered the Eureka 71B, which was already back in stock, and it arrived today.  After vacuuming two flights of carpeted stairs, I can report that it's absolutely wonderful!!  The suction is MUCH more powerful that the Black and Decker Pivot Vac, and I'm glad I won't have to worry about battery life with this model.  Furthermore the Eureka has a wider suction opening than the B&D, the "riser visor" for stairs is incredibly convenient, and I love the attached hose.  The 20 foot cord seems to be a good length, and besides, I would much rather deal with unplugging and moving the cord than dealing with a vacuum that won't hold its charge.
