Not as happy as I expected.
I bought the Screen protectors for my phone based on the reviews on Amazon.  I put them on my phone and within a week I had scuff marks on one part of my screen and bubbles started to form.  I have used the Otter box screen protector on my last phone and was much more satisfied.
