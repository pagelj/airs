A little strange
A rather odd story incorporating the "ancient aliens" with the pyramids.  I would love to believe it!  SciFi folks wont like it b/c it is just very stripped in that respect.  It is not absorbing and I am reading it off and on.  The ending seems predictable but I havent gotten there yet.
