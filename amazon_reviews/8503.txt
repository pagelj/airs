In love with this toaster! UPDATE:  fell out of love...
UPDATE:  The toaster stopped working after about 18 mos. and of course my enthusiasm has gone way down.  Luckily, I live in California and can get it replaced for free (read your booklet). Who would think you could fall in love with a toaster?  We have!  The features are wonderful -- easy to clean, the many choices of settings, ability to cancel with a push of a button, being able to lift the toast higher to get it out easily, and more (see item description).  There's also something lovable about its red, plump, simple appearance.  It's fun to have it on our counter.  It's got to be good to inspire me to take the time to review it!
