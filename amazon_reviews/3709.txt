Good item!
I really like this.  I can put my phone in upside down since my charger slot is on the bottom of the phone and just flip it around.  Holds the phone nice and tight.  Just be aware of where you CD slot is as it will visually block either above the slot or below it depending on how you sit your phone in the mount.
