Great camera
After reviewing several video cameras, the price and functionality were hard to top with this brand. Love the larger viewing screen and remote panning ability. Temp gauge and talk function are also handy. Since buying this unit, we have been averaging about 8 to 9 hrs of battery life .  If I had any cons it would be the lack of extra mounting options for the camera. Great product even when ranked as number 2.
