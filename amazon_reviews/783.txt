You will love this toaster if...........
If you like to make tiny toast out of tiny bread, then this toaster is for you.  If you prefer your toast partially toasted while some parts remain untoasted....... you are gonna love this toaster. I hate this toaster.  Seriously, it won't even fit a normal size piece of bread.  All I can think about when I use this toaster is "What were they thinking?"  One of the most important features of a toaster is that it can accommodate a piece of bread and toast that whole piece of bread.  But even a normal piece of bread sticks out the top and doesn't get toasted. The ad claims "extra wide slots" for bagels.  Really?  Even with the bagel setting, I found that it squashed my bagels between the metal holders. They also claim "backlit function selectors".  One of the other things I found annoying about this toaster is that the different buttons are difficult to see.  They are only "backlit" once you select them.  That doesn't make sense.  I would like to see what my options are before I select them, hence it would be nice if they were backlit all the time (or designed differently so they are more visible). The retractable cord is nice but it seems like they sacrificed some cord length in order to make it retractable so while the cord is retractable, it's a pretty short cord.  You'll need to have an adequate place close to an outlet to use this toaster. While some people found this toaster worthwhile, it just didn't work for me.
