works ok
great price. The quality of the picture leaves a bit to be desired.  At any distance it is hard to see things clearly. There is no zoom.  It is a little difficult to get set up with your router and I occasionally have probelms getting it to connect wirelessly again, which can be a pain since it is mounted somewhere with no easy access to an eithernet cable.  If I get another one, I think I want a white one so it will blend in better with walls and ceilings.  I might have to paint the power coard and wall wort (transformer) white also in order for them to blend in.  It would also have been nice to have a longer power wire.
