In the middle
The screen was easy to put together fit nicely into my Verizon iPhone 4. My friend broke my old screen and I was reluctant to go through apple. However, once the screen was examined closely some imperfections were noticed. The edge of the screen on one side for about a fourth of the edge looks sanded and has a white rough edge. This is only on the complete edge of the glass where the screen meets the plastic. Although this is not an issue, it is just really annoying having this imperfection. Further examination revealed that when too much pressure was applied to the screen it would resemble a laptop or TV where the screen changes color. Although these are not major they show the screen is not made nearly as well as apple's. Overall I have mixed feelingsUPDATE:Screen stopped working no response from seller... Caution.
