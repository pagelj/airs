After using a Faberware percolator for over 25 years I recently switched to a Presto.  The Faberware was great for many years but in most recent years I have had to replace it after only 12 - 18 months.  The coffeemaker is not what it used to be.  With every new one it seemed lighter and more cheaply made.  This Presto makes great, hot coffee and it seems to be a more solid product.  I am not sure how long it will last but, it is a lot less money then the Faberware so, if I have to replace it a year out I will still be ahead.
