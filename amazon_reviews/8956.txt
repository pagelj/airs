Not what was ordered.
I ordered this in conjunction with a camera purchased from the same seller. It was not the right card, not sure if it was the wrong one that shipped or the wrong one on the site. Gave it as a gift and not worth the hassle of getting a new one. Pay attention to the cards that you order in relation to the camera you need it for.
