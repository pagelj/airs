We used to use an electric drip coffee maker but got hooked on this type by my husband's parents. It definitely has an old fashioned feel. The coffee is great, and the warming element keeps it nice and hot. There's a little bit more to clean than a drip type maker that uses paper filters, because you have to take the metal container containing the grounds apart and rinse it before filling again. But really, it's very simple to use. I give it 4 stars only because we're on our second. The first one only lasted a few years (we were expecting at least a decade out of it -- the in-laws have had theirs since the last ice age).
