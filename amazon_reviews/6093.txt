Seems like the perfect "every day, go-to" camera!
OK, I have been browsing digital camera options for months now. After comparing all of my research, I opted for this camera and model and I am glad I did. The picture quality is VERY good. I have not had a chance to capture video with this thing, but I am sure it will be good enough for my purposes. I am mainly using this camera to take pictures anyways, I've got an actual video camera for taking "serious" video. The menu and navigation seem to be pretty easy, as I was able to perform tons of different tasks quickly after reading through the instructions. Seriously read through the manual one time completely, it's only like 20 short pages and you will have a very good idea how to operate the camera's basic functions. If you are looking for an affordable digital camera that will not be obsolete in a few years, I'd recommend this camera for sure. It is ranked so highly everywhere for a very good reasons in my opinion.
