Are you of the cruciform?
If you are not stunned - rocked back on your emotional heels and left gasping - by the fate or F. Paul Dure, then I think you must not be human. If you don't understand the literary scholarship behind the form of Hyperion, the reason John Keats and his poetry is a focus of the story and  the reason the demon is called The Shrike; well, you're missing half the  fun and you really should read something besides science fiction. The  book works at many levels, not the least of which is a spectacular  impalment - a literal impalement, by the way - of religion in general and  Catholicism and Christianity in particular. God exists in this book in the  form of the Technocore, but there's nothing to admire. His angel is an  unstoppable killing machine, and his purposes are vile. But what is a  metaphor here is a large club in the Endymion series. I like and re-read  Hyperion. It has moments that are transcendent. Simmons cannot sustain  those moments, though, which in my mind causes to book to fall short of  greatness.
