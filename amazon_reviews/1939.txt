The 3 is way better.
This is definitely better than the previous editions. I tried the Roku LT but it did not work because my internet is a dsl and slow. but when I got the roku 3 with the same connection it is working flawlessly. I have an older tv so I have an splitter that takes the HDMI and splitts to RCA.
