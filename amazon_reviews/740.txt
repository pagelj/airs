Nice if you are all new
This hold-my-hand-and-show-me-how you do it, is really great for a newbie but if you know what you are doing then just stay away from it. Am a gret fun of scott, I watch his every week photoshoptv and have several of his books. This one too what I should warn you about is the second one which is totally rubbish just capitlizing on this which is good enough. if you need to be told what to do on each and every step then this is the book. I think wedding photographers can get alot out of it, its full of tricks for them.
