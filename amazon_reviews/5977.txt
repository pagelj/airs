Nice - Depth Of Field
I purchased this lens because I wanted to experiment with depth of field.  After my first three pictures I am not disappointed.  The lens seems to have the ability to place the background in a blur with a nice sharp subject in the foreground all that with little work.  Just what I wanted.  I was concerned that the sensor size in my 7D with a 1.6 crop factor might limit my ability to achieve the blurred background, but so far I'd say at least with this F1.4 lens I have no issues.
