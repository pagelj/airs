I have the Liftaway NV351 model... I LOVE IT!  Is it possible to LOVE vacuuming? I love the "navigation" of the swivel head; I love the fact that it never loses suction, yet isn't impossible to push and pull across the carpet (I used to have to assist my Hoover with my foot); I love how quiet it is; I love the fact that it picked up a whole cannister of dust and dirt AFTER I already vacuumed with my Hoover! If I have to point out any negatives, it would be the cord is shorter than most vacuums and I don't really like emptying the canister (I prefer just taking a bag out and throwing it away), but with that said, I do love seeing all that it picks up.  The good word has spread as 4 of us in my office have purchased the Shark Liftaway! Here's an instance where "if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is"... is NOT true! A 5 Star Rating for sure!
