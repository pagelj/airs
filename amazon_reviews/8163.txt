It was excellent for about 1 year and then is no longer usable
We've had this monitor for about 1 year and 1 month now. Functionality-wise, we love it. The video is clear enough to see our baby. And the night vision is just as good as day time, except it's in black and white, even when the room is pitch black. The microphone is very good and we can hear him cry or toss and turn depending on the volume that you set it to. Everything was working great until about a few weeks ago. The charger won't charge the unit anymore unless I really push it in and hold it tight with my hand. The minute I let go, it stops charging. I figure the charging connection is not making contact but the connection itself is not loose; it fits just like the day it arrived. So I can't find a way to solve it except to try calling Motorola and find out if I can get a monitor replacement. We'll see how that goes.
