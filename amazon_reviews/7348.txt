Great Player for little money
So far I have been able to use youtube, Pandora, crackle, aolHD, Slacker and NPR, with no issues. As far as file support goes AVCHD, M2TS, AVI, HD wave, MKV and MP4 have all played on this thing without any glitches. My only complaint with this unit is a tiny BD Player with a tiny remote, I just know the remote is going to get lost. Right now these are cheap even at the big box stores. I can't say anything about reliability yet but that is why I purchased a 4 year warranty. Well done Sony, finally someone was listening to what a BD player should be.
