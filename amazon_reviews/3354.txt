Great as a diaper bag!
I use this backpack as a diaper bag and it works really well.  It has enough pockets and the mesh side pockets are great for water bottles or my babies little sockies.  The clip on the front broke off quickly though and it was probably my fault because I tugged on it too hard but it seemed like it should be a little more durable.  The backpack looks really nice and I've gotten many compliments from mommies.  They are all surprised that it is just a regular backpack.  I think for under $30 it is a great deal.  It looks just like it does in the picture.  If you want a cute diaper bag but don't want to pay top dollar for it, I think this is a great option.
