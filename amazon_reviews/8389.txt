Couldn't put it down!!!
I found Wool when searching for Dystopian fiction on Amazon. I downloaded the first part (a short story), admittedly, because it was free but by the time I finished this brief journey into Silo 18, I was hooked so I purchased the Omnibus edition and I haven't been able to put it down! I am always thrilled when an author can make me feel as though I am living the story at that moment, that I am experiencing  what the characters are going through, and I have such an emotional stake in the outcome of the journey itself. This is so much more than just a story... it's an adventure that grabs hold and whisks you away for the duration and I truly hope there are more stories to tell as the author has alluded to at the end of part 5.
