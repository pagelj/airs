Another Hit
The first quarter of the book was frustrating.  Too many secrets were laid bare too quickly.  I was beginning to believe that Howey was angy at his "accidental" success with Wool, that he wanted nothing to do with the science fiction genre, and that he just wanted out of this world he created. But, the story was engrossing and a page turner (just like Wool).  I grew to appreciate (and even like) the characters, even those I disliked in the beginning of the book.  And the mysteries kept coming.  By the middle of the book I was hooked. There are enough unanswered questions in this book that I hope there is a third installment to the series soon! If you like Wool, this is a must read.
