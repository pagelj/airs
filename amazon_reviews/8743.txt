Well... It's okay...
Okay, first off what does it fit? It fits- 20D with 70-200mm f/2.8 attached (hood reversed)- 10D body only- Sigma 15-30mm f/3.5-4.5- Canon 50mm f/1.8- Canon 28-70mm f/3.5-4.5- Kenko 2x TCBut it's pretty tight. It will take a tripod, but it's realistically too small for my 055probx.  It fits on, but I wouldn't want to overload it - arguably the gear in it does that anyway. It's not uncomfortable but it's a small backpack and when loaded with gear it's not as comfy as I'd perhaps like. It seems reasonably well made, but the double zip for the main compartment is something of a design flaw.  It could, conceivably, work its way open dropping your precious equipment to the floor.  One way to stop this is to have one zip go right the way round to the bottom.  I also have taken the two side straps off and threaded it around the bag so that it's doubly protected. The one problem I have with this bag, is the shoulder straps.  The strap isn't folded (if that makes sense).  If you look at any backpack you have the nylon strap is folded over and held in that position.  This stops the strap coming away from the bottom of the bag.  With this bag, there's nothing to stop it.  I've no problem with it when carrying it - the straps are solid, but as I put it on the strap lengthens and lengthens and I could just see it coming right out the clasp and the bag dropping to the floor. It's pretty good inside - as I mentioned it can hold quite a lot of stuff, but I don't think it would take any bodies with a vertical grip. I will use it, but I've just ordered the Lowepro Flipside 400AW which seems more substantial, better made and more spacious.  I would really only use this for short trips with my second body and my cheaper lenses.  I'd rather not risk anything expensive in this bag, but that's quite reasonable - as it's a cheap bag. To sum up? Nice bag, spacious, questionable design with regards the shoulder straps, usable for small, lightweight gear.
