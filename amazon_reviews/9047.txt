GREAT camera for the money
We needed a digital camera to replace our Nikon film cameras and after some research and reading reviews I saw that this one had great reviews and less issues. It takes very clear, well lit photo's. Our lenses from our other Nikon film camera's fit which is why we wanted another Nikon and though they don't work with the auto setting they still work to take pictures and I dno't mind manually adjusting the lenses until we can afford to buy new ones that work with auto. But so far it works really well! I haven't printed any photo's off yet but will. I didn't download the software either-I was able to hook it up to my computer with the camera cord and the pictures downloaded anyway.
