Great features, defective power connection
I loved all the features and controls on this monitor. It was easy to use, could turn the cameras all around, good visibility, intercom worked well, sound was clear, etc... I wish we could keep it, but... I wasn't crazy about the reliance on power cords to begin with, and we ultimately had to return one set due to a short/defective connection with one of the cameras, and then later a short/defective connection with the parent unit/monitor. The power adaptor to the units is an awful design, and got steadily worse over several months of use to where the monitor would run out of batteries in the middle of the night and beep loudly at us (waking us up from already minimal sleep). I contacted the email address on the brochure from the box - no response. I then called Motorola directly and spoke with someone who asked me to send a copy of my Toys R Us receipt, which I did right away - no response for over a month. I eventually took it back to the store, and a helpful clerk processed the return, thankfully. If Motorola can fix the power connection to the camera/parent unit, this will be a great product. But without a functioning power source, it's worthless.
