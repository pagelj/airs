Great Tansition Camera
I have been toying with the thought of going to a DSLR for some time.  I found this one just days before Christmas and after taking into careful consideration of the other reviews and the pictures posted I decided to order the camera.  It made it in time for me to use it on Christmas morning.  The battery charged quickly and the ease of use in the automatic setting is great. I'm looking forward to experimenting more.  Hopefully, I won't annoy the family too much with the constant picture taking.
