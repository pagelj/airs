Life-saver
I bought this as a backup computer since my much-loved Macbook has been on the fritz and acting funny after 4 years of use.  As a grad student, I use my laptop constantly for writing papers and doing research, so I really needed a reliable computer.  I also do not have $1,500 to shell out on a new Macbook at the last minute.  After checking out other cheap laptops (including touchscreens with Windows 8), as well as notebooks and this computer, I couldn't deny the fact that the Samsung Chromebook got consistently good reviews while laptops more than twice its price were getting pretty crappy reviews.  Since I couldn't really afford anything, I got the Chromebook on a whim about a week ago.  Tonight I was forced to learn how to use it quickly after my Macbook died and I lost the paper I was working on.  I found an emailed version, uploaded it into Google Docs, hooked up the Chromebook to my WiFi printer (Epson Workforce 645), and I am very pleased.  The brightness and quality of display, as well as the included apps had me pleasantly delighted.  The Chrome store is also pretty fun to look through, and has many apps that I already use on my Macbook (incl. Dropbox, which has all my school docs).  It plays video well so far, and apparently is also capable of sharing remote desktop to another computer, and uploading iTunes libraries into its native music player.  It also does look like a cute little Mac Air (clean lines, though extremely cheap).  I was hesitant about whether I would catch on to using this, but I'm starting to really like it so far.  I was very wary of whether this could really allow me to type papers and print, but so far everything works.  Let's see how it holds up to heavier use.
