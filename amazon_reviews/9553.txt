A Lot to Live Up To....
What can I say about Book 5 of ASOIAF that hasn't already been written about obsessively, ad nauseum on blogs everywhere?  This book, for me, was a 'set-up' book that may allow Book 6 to really jump off.  I'm still waiting for a book that will live up to the incredible magic that was Book 3, but that's a pretty high bar to set.  But let's face it, if you've already read over 4,000 pages you're not going to stop at Book 5.  Buy it and escape to Essos across the narrow sea!
