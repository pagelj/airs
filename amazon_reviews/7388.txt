Good protection
I use these currently as added protection for my lenses.  The ones I bought from Amazon all had a promotion for a free 58mm filter.  Who am I to turn it down?  I haven't noticed too much image degradation altho in certain low lights I have seen some flaring and ghosting.  However, the main use for me is to have an added layer of protection from the elements.
