Phone didn't work.
The phone did not work, except for a couple of days after it was received.  It did not work properly even during those two days.  ApexCell promised via email on May 4 to send a replacement.  So far, that replacement has not been delivered.  The USPS Tracking webpage shows that they received an electronic notification from the shipper on May 4 to expect the package, but shows no further activity.  I do not know whether ApexCell failed to ship the replacement phone or if the USPS mishandled the package, but I am not happy.  Thanks for asking.
