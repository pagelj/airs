Good camera but I miss a viewfinder
I bought this camera for a trip.  It was very small and light, which was perfect.  I had looked at the small cameras available and none of them had a viewfinder, so I selected Canon based on reviews and past experience with the brand.  The photos came out fine except for those where I was unable to see the screen (sunlight, reflections, etc.).
