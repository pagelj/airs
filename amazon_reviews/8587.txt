decent knives
I bought 2 sets off their website 4 years ago and they are JUST starting to go dull on me. I notice that I'm having to put more effort in cutting through onions, etc.  BUT that being said -- I just reordered 2 more sets.  They are $20 a set, I will have a ton of knives to work with (and I use them daily AND my knives have a habit of disappearing because my husband will take them outside and never bring them back) -- I love them. They are good knives. I don't recommend putting them in the dishwasher.  They won't last forever, but for $20 a set -- why not?
