Wondering which one to buy? Get this one.
I am using this to power my US 110v Panasonic BDT320 Blu-ray player, which I am currently using in a 220v country. I have the superb Panasonic BDT110 3D Blu-ray player, purchased locally, but the BDT320 is superior in terms of AV playback. I agonised over which one to buy, as the reviews and information was unclear on this and similar products. Get this one. It has a short 2-prong cord for power, has a US 3-prong adapter to plug your device into (the image says it all). Since my device draws only 9 Watts when playing and about 1W or less on standby, it's hardly a strain for this voltage converter. It remains cool and I haven't had to power it off at all yet. There is a red LED that indicates that it is powered on, so you know when it's working or switched off. It's a tad heavy, but that makes it feel robust. Construction is solid and the unit has been reliable. It does what it says on the packaging and does it well.
