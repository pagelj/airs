Happy Wife!
This was the best gift ever, I got it as a gift for my wife as a valentine gift. She loved it and she is using it everyday. It is big and has LOT'S of space so she can storage all that a mommy has to storage in a purse separately. You can't go wrong with this one. By the way, it was delivered to me VERY fast.
