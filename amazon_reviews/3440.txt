Excruciating
I barely made it half-way through this book before I finally gave up.  A great concept gone wrong.  Way too juvenile in it's execution.  I suppose it would appeal to very immature teenagers.  The dialogue was terrible and the violence completely unnecessary.  I won't judge anyone else who liked this book/series, but suffice it to say, it was not my cup of tea.
