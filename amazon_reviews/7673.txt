Very satisfying read
Great read! A fresh post-apocalyptic dystopian novel that had me frantically turning the pages. Apart from a drop in pace in one section it moved along quickly dealing with lots of themes like social control, freedom, friendship, and whether ignorance is truly bliss. One of the most satisfying pieces of fiction I've read. Some great characters. Looking forward to more by this author!
