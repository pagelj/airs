I bought this vacuum to replace an upright vacuum. I like this product because it is light weight, works well on floors and carpets, also easy to vacuum stairs because it is light weight. It does not take up a lot of space, is easy to move around with and reach under furniture which an upright cannot do. The power cord rolls up with a press of a button which is a nice feature.
