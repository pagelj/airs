Excellent camera
My wife lost our camera while on vacation so needed to find one that worked better than the last one; this camera by far out performs the Sony that was lost!  I love the clarity of the pictures even when using the zoom.  The flash does an excellent job of reaching out and revealing!  This is by far the best small camera I've ever owned.
