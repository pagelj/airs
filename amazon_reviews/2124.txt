Rusting already...
Husband and I have owned these before so when we moved he wanted a new set. These knives work GREAT but rust very easily. I have a baby so sometimes I don't wash the previous dishes from dinner until I wake up and that is WAYY too soon to rust in my opinion. :( Other than that they're great but you have to hand-wash and dry them right away to prevent rust.
