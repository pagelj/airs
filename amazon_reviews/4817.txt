Glad I found this author
This is the 2nd book I decided to read by this author and I haven't been disappointed yet. I agree with the other reviewers that said it was a different type of romance. It wasn't just about the main character and him getting the girl. There were a few really nice subplots that added a whole new dynamic to the book. I felt these made it even more entertaining and fun to read. I'd recommend this to others and will be looking forward to reading the rest of this series.
