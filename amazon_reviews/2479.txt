Good Quality for the Money, but no Sony 70-300G
I recently switched from Sony to Canon.  I really like the Canon cameras. I consider myself semi-pro and use a 7D and 40D.  I have to saythat I struggle with Canon glass after using Sony/Minolta for so long. The 70-300USM IS is a good lens, but I would not say great and I used3 different lenses of this model to ensure that I got the sharpest that Icould find.  I also did this with the 7D. If you want the sharpest camera/lens you will find that there can be verylarge variations in different batches of cameras/lenses for quality. I found the older the lens of this model to be the softest and the focushunt was much more pronounced. I also own a Canon 100-400L and it is very good in the field although itweighs a lot compared to the 70-300USM IS and the cost is any where fromdouble to triple depending on used or new deals. I find the images soft at 300mm, the AF is slow and on wildlife hunts and oftendoes not lock, but for the money and mobility it is a keeper until Canon offerssomething similar with better quality. I tried the 55-250 and if you are looking for sharpness pass on this lens. If you arelooking for a good all around lens its okay and smaller than the 70-300USM IS. This lens is okay from a semi-pro perspective and if I had not used the Sony 70-300Glens so extensively before switching I would probably be happier with this lens.
