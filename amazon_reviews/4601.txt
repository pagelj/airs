I have been using my coffee maker for about two weeks now and have to say ... I LOVE IT!!!! I was very nervous about some of the negative reviews on here but I have to say that I have had little to no troubles with it so far. I was nervous about ordering such a large one but with the 1-4 feature I have found that the four cup is just perfect. I can have a mug while getting ready in the morning and also fill up a travel mug to take with me to work to sip on. = D I dont need the beeps in the morning but find that I rarely even hear it go off now, and I live in an apartment so the kitchen isn't that far from the bedroom. The automatic turn on feature is the BEST!! I know it isn't anything knew but I love getting up in the morning and smelling the coffee. The snap on lid isn't that big of a hassel for me. It comes on and off very easily and while it might have been nice to have one that tipped up, I find that I don't miss the lid accidently flopping open because you tip the carafe too far over. I don't mind the gold filter but am using paper filters inside of it because I love the ease of pulling out the whole filter and filling a new one with coffee grounds and not worrying about rinsing the gold filter as well. To each his own I guess. The white lettering for filling the water in the coffee maker is a bit difficult. I just line up the carafe to the area and start pouring and then bend down to eye the line that I want while I'm pouring. I have yet to spill. I have been thinking of putting a small dot with a sharpie or something there, just to make it a bit easier. I found the the opening to pour in the water is PLENTLY large eough. I have filled the water and then added the coffee grinds, and done it the other way around where I add the coffee grinds and then pour in the water. Either way, I haven't had any troubles. I would highly suggest this coffee maker to anyone, and to top it off, it is PINK!! So pretty and matches my pink standing mixer as well. :-)
