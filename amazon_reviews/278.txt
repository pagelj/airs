Wasabi Power Batt and charger kit.
I charged one battery and am using it.  Will see how long this battery would last as some OEM batteries had issues.  The Japanese cells must be good though.  Price is excellent for this unit, with two batteries and a neat charger to boot.  Would recommend it to others.
