I was a little skeptical about the reviews.  We have owned 2 Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee pots before.  This pot really makes me happy.  It is 12 cups which helps with company.  But I usually make 4 cups.  It is hard to find a pot that makes a good 4 cup pot, but this one does.  My family roasts coffee so we are a little bit snobby about our coffee flavor.  This is a really good one!  For the hot water system... I love it.  It is summer time, so I am not using it as much (I don't drink tea). But I have made oatmeal several times.  The water gets hot!!!  I wasn't expecting it to get SO hot.  It is perfect!  It has no plastic taste.  It does take some time to heat up in between cups, but not long.  I have already taken the tea pot out of my kitchen because I know this will replace it for winter teas and  cocoas!  Overall good product.  Small footprint for what you are getting, looks good on the counter.  I listened to the other reviews, I use a funnel and small old coffee carafe to fill it.  My husband has filled it with it's own carafe and says he had no problems.  I am still using my system because I like to fill the back with a clean carafe (less coffee residue builds up that way.  I am overall very happy with the purchase.
