I live my Keurig.  It brews a fresh cup of coffee each time.  I used to make a 6 cup pot of coffee to get one or two cups before it got old and had to be thrown away.  I know you use a k-cup each time, but I am not wasting so much coffee and it is fresh every time, aslo I drink decaf and my spouse drinks regular, so it is great for that reason too.  You can get the k-cups here on Amazon at the best price on the internet too.  I highly recommend.
