Thinking about getting a couple more
I've read the complaints by other people that this doesn't give off enough light. Hogwash! It's designed to light up your keyboard, not an entire room. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I've been using mine for a couple of months now. It can be adjusted to eliminate screen reflection and to focus light exactly where you want it. It stays put, when adjusted, which is very important to me. It does have a working switch to turn the light off and on. I don't generally use it, but it's a nice feature. I really couldn't be happier with it. I'm seriously thinking about getting a couple more for other machines. The price is great. Just don't do what I did and forget its there and try to close your laptop screen on it.
