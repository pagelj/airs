A Merry Christmas to my Hubby
My avid reading husband vowed never to touch a Kindle... no, only hardcover books for him. He isn't much for the new fangled doo-dads of the 21st century. However... in a matter of one day the man declared he loves the Kindle. So bright, so light, so fancy in a leather case (I purchased that from Amazon, too). He's read 2 books on it since Christmas. Amazon support was 5 stars in the support department as my Kindle is 4th Gen. If mine breaks, collapses, I will be owning a Kindle Fire HD 8.9" myself.
