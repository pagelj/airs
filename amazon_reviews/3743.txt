Good Read
3.5 stars! First let me say I did like this book but I might be of the minority when I say I didn't love it. I just felt like it was too short and had so much potential. Don't get me wrong it was heartbreaking and I did feel sad for Nell but again it was too short for me to fully connect with Kyle and Nell's relationship. I connected more with her and Colton's relationship. The sex scenes were very hot (bonus!) but kind of felt out of place in this story. Again I did enjoy the story just wasn't as affected as most readers.
