Volume broke within 3 uses
Worked great 3 times!  My daughters were thrilled.  Then, no volume came out of speakers, although they could use the headphones.  Customer service, a third party concern in India somewhere, told me they would accept a return under warranty.  Some unknown other company called Hyper Micro Systems is supposed to repair it or send me a new unit.  I have to pay $7 by "banker's check" (can you believe it?) for this privilege. Dealing with all these third parties makes me nervous.  I'm not sure I'm going to go through with it.  Perhaps I'll just return in to Amazon for a partial refund. Anyway, don't bother wasting your money on this cheap piece of junk.
