Nikon Coolpix S8200 Camera
Did not had the opportunity to use this camera extensively. Took a number of pictures and am very pleased with the results. The resolution seems to be excellent. Took some pictures outdoors during daytime. The results were very sharp pictures using both normal and close- ups. Also took some shots at night and again had very pleasing results. Using this camera one has to be careful how to hold it. Usually the left hand is positioned right where the flash comes up, so one has to get used to hold the camera somehow different as not to block the flash from being extended. Haven't experimented with taking movies as yet. Amazon did not disappoint me in purchasing this unit. The price was right and the delivery came on time as promised.
