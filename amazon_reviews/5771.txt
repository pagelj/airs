This clothes washing tool used in a 5 gallon bucket with soap and warm water makes quick work of cleaning clothes. I got it for a trip, decided not to pack it because I hadn't tried it out yet and didn't want to pay baggage rates for airlines by bringing along a 5 gallon bucket. I wished I had it on the trip. Had to wash clothes by hand in sink and didn't work out so well. I could have just filled the bathtub with water and used this tool. I came home and washed some underwear with the Rapid Washer and it worked great. Next trip, I will definitely pack it.
