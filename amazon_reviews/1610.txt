Knife Sharpener
Follow the instructions thoroughly and your knives will be good as new when you first bought it. My 9' inch Forshner utility kitchen knife is one-sided sharp. It"s because I sharpened it with a stone before I decided to order this sharpener. It"s not sharp after a few tries. Spent an hour sharpening the knife. Might as well buy a new knife ! It"s good to maintain a like new edge using this sharpener. No assembly required. Place it on a level surface , plug it , and sharpen. Easy to dispose metal filings. Great for pros and non-pros alike. I recommend this product to everyone !!
