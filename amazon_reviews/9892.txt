Does what it's suppose to
I bought this item on Black Friday because it was on sale for $74.99. However, the first one I got had a dent on the back of it. I asked Amazon for a replacement which they kindly approved and did a next-day shipping. I received it one day later and it was perfect. It does what it's suppose to. I never got around to using its other features such as Netflix or Amazon Instant Videos. That's because I own a WDTV which does all of that plus access my media share.
