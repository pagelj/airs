Big, plasticky, and constantly out of power...
Switched over from an iPhone 4 and like the OS... Love Androd flexibility, customization, etc. just not on this phone. After 2 days I bought an extended battery which made a large phone - large and HEAVY. I put the original battery back in, dropped it, shattered the glass, and bought a Droid Razr Maxx HD off of Craigslist. That's my experience.  I hope it helps people. Good luck out there!
