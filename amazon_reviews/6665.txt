Rushed to market but NOT ready.
I had been waiting for this camera for months and was very excited to be able to get one the first day of its release. Took it home, charged the battery, popped in the SD card and went outside to snap some pix. Very fast to power up and the zoom speed and focus speed - terrific! In my backyard and at a nearby lake, the images captured were very nice. Later that night, at full zoom, I captured a terrific image of the moon. Very detailed and I was again very pleased. Following evening, I captured some images indoors while utilizing the flash... and then I saw what I thought might be a problem - in the left lower corner of the camera's LCD screen, the image looked a little dark. Transferred the images to my Mac and yes, there was a dark area on the image captured in the left lower corner. It was most obvious when using the flash indoors and capturing a light colored image (flash used on my white French door curtains)... very noticeable. Decided to try another test and actually laid down on the floor and flash photographed the 18 foot high ceiling in my family room which had just been painted "arctic white". Terrible brown "smudge" located in the left lower quadrant of the image captured. Took the camera back to Best Buy and exchanged it for another - which turned out to suffer from an even worse version of the same problem. Returned that one and picked up another version from a different BB store, and that version was similarly affected with the above described flash issue... so I'm done with the DSC WX300... and will get the Canon version... the 280. If your DSC WX300 does not suffer from this issue, congratulations because its a great camera and will likely provide many years of great image capturing.
