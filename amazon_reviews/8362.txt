Yellow and black as been a sign of "heavy duityness" for some time now, from police tape to construction, even bees. Yellow and black draws attention. With that said, they colored this vaccume appropriately. I live in a dorm, and needed something not to big, just to clean the carpet in my room. DID IT EVER! I didn't even take it through my entire room before i noticed everything it got off my floors, and when i looked at the filter, i could see the jailed dirty suspects that littered my room just minutes ago. I haven't used it much so im not sure about how long you can have it without worrying about it breaking. But i get a good feeling from this thing. It is very convenient and there isn't a spec of dirt in my dorm thats safe now. I can quickly turn off the brush but keep the suction, so i can use the tube/attachment to get into corners and what not. The entire time i was cleaning my room i felt like inspector gadget or something. The useful yet simple features are very self explanitory and cater to whatever situation you might need this baby in.
