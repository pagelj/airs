I wanted a single serve coffee maker, but did not want the expense of the other brands and their "pods." This is a small unit, does not take up valuable counter real estate, and does not have a glass carafe to break.  It allows me to continue to enjoy my favorite ground coffees, but also to introduce new tastes, and I do not have to brew a whole pot when I only want one cup.
