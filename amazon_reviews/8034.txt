I use these all the time. I have noticed the chefs knife dulling a bit but that's normal. They are extremely sharp and I've hand washed and immediately dried them so I haven't seen any issues with the blades. The handle color changed after the first couple of washes so it's not as dark. Still not a bad set for the price.
