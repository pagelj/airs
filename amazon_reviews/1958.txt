My Alarm Clock
This app is great for my Kindle Fire, and I recently used it as a "back-up" for the alarm clock on my iPhone.  I had inadvertently turned the volume down on my iPhone, but the Alarm on my Kindle Fire saved the day.  You can load your own music (for alarms) plus it comes with several other alarms... and you don't have to have the app open for the alarm to work!  Great app!
