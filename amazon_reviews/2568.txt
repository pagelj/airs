Great for the price.
Using it on a 106" screen in 2D mode only. Very nice blacks and bright colors. Easy to set-up. Replaced a 720p projector and there is a big improvement in quality of the image. The only issue I had with the projector is that it doesn't have a built in 12 volt trigger for the screen. I had to purchase an extra device so the screen would operate.
