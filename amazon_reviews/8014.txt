Sister Loves It!
My sister earned some cash for doing some yard work, and decided to spend it on this backpack. When it came in she said she loved the color. It looks durable. After a period of about a month, she has been using this backpack and it is still in great shape. It fits everything she needs in it. Jansport is a great brand, I have a Jansport backpack myself.
