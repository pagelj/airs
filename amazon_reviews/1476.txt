An absolute must
It is necessary to have that extra battery pack so you don't run out of juice in the middle of the woods. These batteries hold charge for a fairly long time unless you're big on flash photography or the AF (both of which I'm not). The only downside is they are expensive than conventional AA batteries and if you're not looking to invest in a battery-grip this should suffice your clicking needs.
