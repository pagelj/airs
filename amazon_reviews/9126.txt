FANTASTIC KNIFE FOR THE MONEY
I currently own a $3k+ set of Wusthof Classi Ikon knives and I love them dearly.  Honestly, the Wusthof product is the best on the market today in my opinion. While stumbling on Amazon looking for an inexpensive bread knife for my girlfriend's mother (Christmas present), I found the Rada Cutlery product.  Being the skeptical person that I am, I couldn't possibly believe that a $10 bread knife could perform anywhere near as well as my $120 Wusthof bread knife.  Not caring much about the quality of the knife for my future mother-in-law, I bought it from Amazon without even thinking twice DUE TO THE VERY VERY LOW PRICE.  While my Wusthof is a far better quality knife in fit and finish, it cuts marginally better than the Rada $10 knife. After experiencing the Rada bread knife, I had to get a Rada knife for myselfand my excuse was for "everday use".  I purchased the dicer (Model: R129) and am truly amazed at how well it performs.  The blade is far thinner than I ever thought, but it seems to be very strong and is definitely very sharp.  It overall doesn't have the fit and finish of the Wusthof (especially in the handle), but it is a fanastic knife that I enjoy using for virtually anything. It even cuts ripe tomatoes well without any crushing. I plan on purchasing more Rada Cutlery products in the future.  Can't go wrong for the price.  If you're on a budget or simply looking for a decent knife for the money, forget all others and JUST GO FOR THE RADA!!!
