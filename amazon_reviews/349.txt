Unreliable DropCam Drops Video Connection Constantly
At first I was really impressed with the camera, but it does have some major issues for those looking to use it as a "security camera."  This camera is nothing more than to be used for fun or possibly nanny cam.  It has no real value when it comes to a security or surveillance camera. My secure Wi-Fi is restricted to registered MAC addresses (MAC address filtering).  I entered the camera's MAC address in my filter list and it still could not find the network.  The only solution was to DISABLE my MAC address filtering, which makes my Wi-Fi less secure. It took only a few minutes to get the camera connected and running.  It has an impressive clear video quality and wide field of view.  I liked the ability to record audio as well.  The iPhone app works great and I can view video from my phone.  The night vision is great too.  I really liked the idea of recording to an off-site location for security purposes; however, this uses an incredible amount of bandwith. The motion sensor picks up everything.  For an indoor camera where there is a lot of movement (like a business), this is useless.  So, I had to turn the motion detection off, otherwise it would mark a new motion event every 10 seconds. I have 3 of these cameras setup.  The video drops throughout the day for hours at a time, making the live stream inaccessible and huge gaps in the archive footage.  I have e-mail notification setup to be alerted when the camera has been "offline for 30 minutes," but I have yet to receive ANY e-mail notifications.  For example, on a particular day, one camera was offline for over 3 hours and another offline for over 2 hours.  Additionally, if it goes offline while you are away, it will still say it is online but you can not access the video; it will freeze up your internet browser or lock up your phone. I will be returning these for a refund; I'd rather take the extra time and expense and setup a reliable camera for security.
