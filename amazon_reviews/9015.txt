Not as nice as Belkin or Incase but it works
This fits my Samsung Chromebook quite well and I am happy with it over all. I will say that the foam inserted into it to hold it's shape is rather stiff and makes it feel cheap. I have a Belkin neoprene sleeve case for each of my Kindles and they are much nicer as they don't have a stiff foam in them. I also have two Incase brand neoprene sleeve cases for my other laptops and they too do not have the stiffness of this case. The Incase brand cases also have a softer material inside, much like fleece. All that said, it works well and protects my computer from scratches as desired.
