Great for the price!
There are lots of baby monitors in the market. It is hard to decide what is the best for my baby. This Motorola digital baby monitor is very easy to use, just turn on the switchs, it automatically connect to each other. Night vision is also working quite good. It detects every sound baby make. One problem is that it is hard to place camera unit without drill holes to the bed in my case. If some kind of clamping unit to place camera is supplied, it will be much better for all around usage. Anyway, I am very satisfied with Motorola Digital Video Baby monitor and I will recommend it to pricewise-parents.
