Dont Spend The Big Bucks
The Amazon line of Basics is pretty good overall and I use their stuff in just about every category they offer but these are amazingly good.  I had some fancy Monster 3-D hdmi cables running to my 3D blu-ray player that were hit or miss in the delivering 3D department and were too long (my son the cable guy convinced me to spend $89.00 and said they were the best and only way to see proper 3D TV) and consequently kept getting pushed out onto the floor in front of the TV where my granddaughter proceeded to eat them with the vacuum cleaner leaving wire exposed.  They never were the same after that and they didn't really provide smooth signal before without constant jiggling and repositioning - hence - always getting moved about.  Well these had arrived and I popped them in and haven't looked back since.  You have to have the high speed for 3D and these guys deliver and I guess it helps that they're shorter too or so I've been told.  Anyway they work better than the $89.00 0nes and they don't get in the way so why should I pay $89.00 for trouble when I can spend a few bucks on these and do just fine. I'm sold anyway.
