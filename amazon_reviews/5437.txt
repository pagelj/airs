Brilliant writing--fabulous characters
I can't believe I got this far in my adult life without reading this book! I guess I was put off by the length and the sci-fi slant of it, thinking that it might be over my head. But this is a completely readable, completely engaging novel that really packs an emotional punch. I loved Ender as a character--loved his independent genius, his pessimistic hope, and the strength that lay hidden behind his very innocent face. I found the narrative of his training completely involving, though I was much more concerned for his emotional well-being. Poor kid. The climax caught me completely off-guard and was quite stunningly brilliant. Enough said there. I found the conclusion a bit melancholy, but realistic. I imagine that the guilt Ender felt was not easy to erase, no matter what they told him. And the fact that I'm talking about him like he's a real person, well, there you have it. Card's Ender is very, very real, and very, very exceptional. Fabulous book!
