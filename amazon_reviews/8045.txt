would rather not rate... may be just me not knowing what to do!
I don't know what I'm doing with this device! We can't seem to figure out how to get it to work properly... I wish WOLVOL had a customer "tech support" phone number! It's working very slowly and we can't seem to be able to get to different games/pages. We are also getting messages saying that the internet connection was "lost"... well... I'm LOST! help.
