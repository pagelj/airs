Not just the best knife for the money...
Cook's Magazine, which does almost ridiculously extensive testing of kitchen products and recipes, says this is the chef's knife to buy at any price. Fortunately, at about $20 on Amazon, the Forschner Victronix knife is a bargain. It's sharp, balanced well and makes food prep a breeze. I'd also read about the knife on a blog by an amateur chef in the Bay Area. Those two sources, and my frustration with every knife I'd ever bought previously, convinced me that everyone needs at least one good knife at their disposal, so I ordered this one. There may well be a $90 knife out there I would like better, but for 20 bucks, you can't go wrong with this bad boy...
