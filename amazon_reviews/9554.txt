I AM IN LOVE!!
I absolutely adore this purse. I bought it in the pink color and can I just say that this is now my favorite purse. It's roomy, and it has a middle zipper compartment thing that I just love. I can fit anything in this purse. It's just perfect for normal day wear, even if you want to use it for school. I use this bag for everything!! There is nothing that I would change about it. When It arrived it was packaged so well I was surprised and there have been some reviews saying that it had a weird smell but mine had no smell to it. Overall I love this purse and definitely recommend it!
