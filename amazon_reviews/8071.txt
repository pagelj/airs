Dangerous, poorly made
toaster oven is small and poorly designed.  when opening the door fully, it pulls out the metal rack inside.  however, due to the shape of the metal catch arms on the door, which pull out the rack, one cannot fully close the toaster oven because the arms then catch on the rack and will not close properly.  This was a minor annoyance.  What is really bad is the self timer does not work, so when cranking the knob to toast for instance, instead of winding down and turning off like most toaster ovens, this just stays on.  Just caused a fire which I had to put out with an extinguisher.  Overall, most all B&D products I have tried in recent past have been poorly made, this is no exception.  Stay away, this poses a fire danger.  get one with digital timer, and another brand.
