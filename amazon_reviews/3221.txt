Fun and Fast Paced
I had a blast reading this book.  In a day and age when every facet of your childhood is referenced in countless VH-1 shows, blog posts, and comedy routines, this book managed to dredge up memories that brought countless smiles to my face. Oh yeah, and it's a ripping good yarn, too. Other reviewers have posted detailed plot synopses, so I won't waste the energy, but if you like adventure stories and grew up on D&D, Atari, and lived at the arcade, you will have a blast with this book.  I tore through it in two days and I'm thinking about plowing through it again. Highly recommended.
