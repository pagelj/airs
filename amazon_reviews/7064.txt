This is the smallest microwave I could find, so it saves a little counter space.  I was a bit worried that a full sized dinner plate wouldn't fit into it, but a dinner plate fits with room to spare.  If you don't need to microwave a full chicken or turkey on a regular basis (and honestly, who does?), this microwave is almost certainly large enough for your needs. I have to agree with a previous reviewer about that giant sticker, though - that thing was horribly annoying to take off, and has left a nasty, scuzzy scar in its wake.  I'm pretty sure the scuzzy scar isn't as bad as the sticker itself was, but an awesome third option would be NOT having the sticker on there in the first place. Also, this is going to sound silly, but the door is a little hard to get open in contrast to the weight of the microwave.  Maybe it will loosen with time, but right now the machine itself moves a half to a full inch every time I open the door.  And finally, for ultimate pettiness, I'd like to mention that the "done" chime is louder and harsher than I'd like. Still, for the price and the size?  Pretty good little machine.  I'd buy it again. May 2013 update:The little guy is still working like new, the sticker scuzz is still there, and the door has indeed become easier to open. Definitely a good purchase.
