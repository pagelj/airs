My favorite part
I loved this book. The idea that the dinosaurs didn't really become extinct and had lived here on Earth and on the Moon before us, really sparked my imagination.  When they returned to reclaim the Earth we were here and planned to stay here.  Could be live together, were they more advanced, was their technology greater than ours?  The dinosaurs have personalities and emotions and their leader is brave and honorable but like some humans they had dinosaurs who wanted war. Because of the resulting conflicts and chaos, I feared for the brave, animal loving Ranger and the young, attractive Archaeologist. I couldn't see how they would both be alive by the end of the book! This was a terrific story!  I know that because my grandchildren (ages 10 and 6) asked me to tell them what the book was about and we ended up reading it to the end together!  I substituted age-appropriate language at times but that didn't distract from the fun and excitement of enjoying this great story together!  And talk about a "feel good" ending! I'll be watching for more books from this author!
