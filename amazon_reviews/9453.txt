Loves it
Grea product for a great price.  I use this for golfing I need a long life battery because my GPS eats up my I phone battery quickly when playing 18 holes and this does the trick!  It allows my mount to hold my phone too unlike the ones that fit on the bottom of the phone this attaches with a cord it is a bit bulky but really holds a nice sized charge and allows your holder to hold your phone at the same time.
