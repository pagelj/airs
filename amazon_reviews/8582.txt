'Twilight' for Fanboys.
I never read "Twilight," from what I have heard from other readers and the film itself, it is poorly developed story that panders to teenage girls for an easy fix. This is how I feel about "Ready Player One"; however, instead of teenage girls it for those 80s fanboys who obsess with the era's pop culture.  The story has minimum character development, the least feasible situations, an horde of villains that are as more threatening as a Stormtrooper's aim. There are so many deus-ex-machina moments that the main characters must be gods themselves. This panders to any fanboy's basic fantasies in a World of Warcraft setting. So what... I am sorry I was such a "Twilight" hater. Okay, maybe not. But I understand. I have talked to several intelligent women, women I respect and honor their opinions, and they say cannot help but love the tripe that is "Twilight". Okay, I understand. I just hope that you understand why I dig "Ready Player One." So if you are a geek. Read it. It is nothing good, but I think you will like the light read. If you are not a geek, fanboy, video-game player, D&D lover, or anyone that know the meaning of 42, stay away.
