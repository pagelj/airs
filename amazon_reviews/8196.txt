I've had my Delonghi EC702 for 2 months now.  It has just started to leak like crazy.  While warming up water drips badly from the area that you attache the handle with the coffee.  If you go ahead and attach the handle it just drips coffee.  The steam wand shoots more water than it does steam.  You have to run it for 30 seconds or so before the water clears and you get steam.  If you are inclined to try the E. S. E. pods good luck.  I got no coffee.  Just clear water ran through it into the cup. My guess is that the quality control has changed since Italy turned over the manufacturing to China.  My advise, buy something else.
