QUALITY IS TERRIBLE! THE TOASTER BROKE WITHIN ONE DAY!!!
It is a very cute set.  My grandaughter used the toaster one time and you could hear the part break off inside the toaster... needless to say we where both very upset.  If you just want to look at it on a shelf.. it's great.  If you actually want to play with it.. well... I would not buy this product.
