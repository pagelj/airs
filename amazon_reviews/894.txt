We've had cuisinart coffee makers before and they have all worked well. As does this one. However, the hot water coming out of the tea maker has a plastic/off taste. I like to drink herbal and green teas and unfortunately wish I had gotten a glass electric tea kettle. Since this cuisinart is now used, I can't return it without getting only 50% of the cost back.  If you drink at least good to decent quality green or herbal teas, don't get this product.  I'm serious.  (4 stars for the coffee maker, 0 stars for the tea maker = 2 stars total)
