Most reliable, easy to use
I've had this phone for more than four years. Dropped it in the toilet once in year three. Still works. Holds a charge for close to a week even now (I do talk less than 300 min/month). What made me come here to write this review is the quality of its keyboard. Keyboards on current phones don't compare to this one. It has nice, firm buttons that actually feel like you press them, rather than soft buttons that are too often non-reactive. If the Envy3 is anything like this, that would be my choice for my next phone.
