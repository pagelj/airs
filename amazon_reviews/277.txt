What a Deal!
Christmas brought me an IPAD - and I did a lot of shopping for the right bag in which to carry it!  I wanted something light, over the shoulder, padded for protection; and still have a bit of room so I wouldn't have to carry a purse.  And of course, something that wouldn't break the bank. This is it!  Met every need, and bonus - it looks nice. Another extra is the small zippered compartment in the front that fits my blackberry quite well.  I LOVE THIS BAG. and going back to buy the black one!
