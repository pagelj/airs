ONE OF THE BEST
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A REGULAR KIND OF REVIEW. YOU SEE, THERE IS PROS AND CONS TO EVERYTHING. A PRO FOR ONE PERSON IS A CON FOR ANOTHER. I BOUGHT THIS NIKON WITH THE 16-85MM LENS AND ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT THIS IS THE BEST CAMERA I HAVE EVER OWNED AND EVER WILL OWN. I AM 66 YEARS OLD; BEEN DOING PHOTOGRAPHY FOR FIFTY YEARS AND THIS WILL BE THE LAST CAMERA THAT I WILL EVER NEED. IF YOU WANT THE BEST, BUY THIS CAMERA. BY THE WAY, I AM USING ISO SPEEDS BETWEEN 100-6400 AUTO, AND GETTING GREAT RESULTS. RICHARD M. SELTZER
