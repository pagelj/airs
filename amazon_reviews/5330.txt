We purchased our first Miele 6 years ago, and despite it still going strong, we decided to get a new one.  The old one had some bumps and bruises (our fault), but absolutely no mechanical issues.  This one was a wonderful surprise!  It has several settings, and is incredibly quiet!  First: the handle is a bit odd ergonomically.  If I had to use this all day, it would be rough on the wrist.  Yet for a once a day household vacuum, it's fine.  The settings are for suction intensity, and thus noise level.  The floor piece has setting for hardwood or carpet.  The quiet setting is super quiet.  Suction great!  Stylish too.  Comes with three wand attachments.  Rest assured if you purchase this vacuum, it will last, you will always be pleased with it.
