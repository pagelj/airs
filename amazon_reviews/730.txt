If I could do it all again I'd order from somewhere else.
I recommend Newegg. com if you're looking for a hassle-free purchase with a timely delivery. This item got lost, mispackaged, and lost again in under 2 days and as a cheap purchase it's not worth the time, effort, or frustration of dealing with clumsy Amazon employees who have a tendency to lose things and keep you waiting longer than most sites for your item.
