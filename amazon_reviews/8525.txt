Exactly what I needed
I set this camera up to use as a baby monitor. I didn't want to spend $200+ on an actual video monitor, and this camera does exactly what I need. I downloaded the Foscam pro app so I can see the nursery right from my iPhone. Setup was very easy, although if you want to watch it outside of your wireless network you need to use DDNS and port forwarding. That's what I did anyway. The audio is great, and I am using the camera to watch my dogs when I'm not home since my baby hasn't been born yet. I love it.
