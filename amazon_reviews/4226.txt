Decent for price.
I've purchased these screen protectors numerous times for my iPhone 4s. It comes with 6 for the front and I end up using 3 right away just to get it on right because there are SO many bubbles. Most don't come out. It scratches pretty easy and it leaves a streaky look to the screen which you get used to, but it's annoying at first. You kind of get what you pay for with these but they are still decent, especially with the prices of HQ protectors.
