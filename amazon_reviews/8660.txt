A surprise
Buying a $1 book i was skeptical. And after researching before I bought I saw that the author wanted to the book to be free bu amazon wouldn't let him. After seeing his writing style online (read "The Egg") and liking it, I did the $1 investment. I was not disappointed. A great story about a man left on mars and his struggle to stay alive. The best part of the book is the writing style. The first person is perfect for it. This book is a page turner. Some parts are so intense. The book is both Funny, and serious. The book is also a technical writing of sorts. The main character constantly describing everything he did so you can picture it like you are there. The last few pages definitely fizzle out but didn't leave me upset. I personally loved this book. Every character is great. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is into first person narratives, or science buffs or anyone looking for a great bargain because for $1 you get a 5 hour book that will make you quite angry no one has tried to turn this into a move. IT BETTER BECOME A MOVIE!!!!
