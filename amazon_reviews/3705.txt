Don't buy any other toaster!  This thing is just the best value for money out there.  Looks good, perfect toast every time- even if you use it repeatedly, linear toaster setting knob, English Muffins.. no problem (just place the cut sides of the muffin facing outwards).  Can't believe some folks pay $50 or more for toasters....
