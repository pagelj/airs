major WiFi issues
Great tablet all around except for the minor detail that it has MAJOR wifi connectivity issues. It cuts out about 1 every 2 minutes, making the thing nearly worthless when doing anything online (which, for me, is about 70% of the time). What's the point? Apple claims this is a minor issue affecting only some users, but if you go on their support pages or google the issue, it is clear this is a very wide-spread problem.
