Works good and looks hot
Very nice looking portable CD/DVD reader, I recent had to get one cause I decided to install a third hard drive on my laptop and had to get rid of the one that was in the slot. I think its awesome and so I dont mind having to carry a portable dvd reader. works good and looks sleek, its a little loud but i dont mind uses up 2x usb slots so make sure you have at least 2 open usb slots for this drive
