cant be beat for the price
had this lens since christmas for my Rebel Si with the 18-55.  This lens is a perfect complement.  This is not a professional quality lens, but if you an amateur shooter on a budget, it is fantastic.  If you just enjoy shooting and want a decent zoom for closeups, long distance shooting this is it.  I also got the 250D closeup filter, and since i've never used a macro before, it is a lot of fun.  I now have a great all round DSLR setup for a relatively small amount of money - a huge range of focal lengths for someone who just wants to play around with a camera and take some decent images.  I would highly recommend the lens, just don't expect it to be pro quality or durability.  Oh and the colours and sharpness won't be pro level but you'll still have fun with it.
