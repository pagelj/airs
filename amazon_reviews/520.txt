great backpack, just not for me
this is a great backpack, it has lots of storage and room inside for just about anything. the top carry handle is solid and comfortable, the zippers worked flawlessly. the top soft lined pocket is great for a phone, keys, sunglasses, etc and easy to get to. all the organizing pockets were adequate and easy to get tothe very front pocket has a small opening and you can't get your hand down inside the pocket to get stuff out so don't throw small items in therethe shoulder straps are a bit rigid on the side seams and is the reason i returned this item. they dug into my arms and side and made it uncomfortable to carryif you carry it on one shoulder you might be fine, it just annoyed me enough to have to return it. i got the HP RU350AA backpack that is sold here as well. it's only slightly smaller but more comfortable
