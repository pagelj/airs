Poor documentation
The owners manual that came with this unit is nearly worthless.  I am a Electronic Systems Enginer and have been documenting electronic equipment for decades and that which came with this unit is clearly the worst I have ever seen.  It was obviously written by some one who doesn't know the english language nor what technical documentation should contain.  At the moment I have not determined whether or not or how to make the unit do it's basic task which is to run a timed loop continuously to provide a video record in case it is needed.  If I don't get the unit functioning as I believe it should I may return it.  I see this as a blight on Amazon's reputation to be selling this sort of thing.
