Great so far
I've had this lens since October 2007, with no problems so far.  It's lightweight plastic, but it still works great.  It's the lens I usually keep on my camera, and I don't exactly coddle it. If you have a Digital Rebel of some sort, this is without a doubt the cheapest lens you can find that will actually give you fully sharp pictures consistently at full resolution.  It's a whole different world from the kit lens in terms of image quality and versatility; you can get great pictures with this lens in low-light situations where a kit lens produces nothing but crap, and you can get shallow depth-of-field portraits that are way beyond what a kit lens can deliver.
