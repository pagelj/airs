Ok but not great
I replaced an old LG candy-bar phone with the VX8300, it's a good replacement (considering) but the MP3 performance is just not acceptable. I've heard better quality from key chain players that cost $9. The volume level is too low and it has no bass at all when driving earbuds (Sony MDREX90LP). It does sound good when driving a cassette adapter (XM) in the car so that's how I'll be using it. It's just not so hot for the office.
