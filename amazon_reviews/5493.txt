Good quality pictures from a basic camera
I needed a replacement camera, but didn't have a lot to spend, so this Nikon was my choice. I have had it for a month, and I have been very happy with the image quality, from inside to outdoors, and especially close-ups. The camera does not have a lot of complicated features, but the settings work well. I don't use the easy auto setting very much, because it doesn't usually pick the appropriate setting. But I have had good results with the automatic setting, and choosing my own scene mode like macro or sports. I often turn off the flash for better results, and the pictures do not get blurry like on my old camera. The zoom works very well, even after you go past the optical zoom and into digital. The only slight issue I have found is that it is sometimes slow to take the shot and save it so that you can take the next one. This seems to be a Coolpix thing, because my last one did it too. However, my final comment would be on how great the video quality is. I was impressed with both the sound and image quality of the few I've taken so far. If you are looking for an affordable basic digital camera, then I highly suggest the Coolpix L22.
