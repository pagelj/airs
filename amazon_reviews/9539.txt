Nice but one down side
after the bread is done and it pops up, the bread does not lift much over the toaster slots, you have to put your fingers in the slots to get the toast out. I found a way , the same lever that you push down to toast the bread ' after the toast is done and it pops up, you push the lever up  hold with one hand and the toast pops up higer and you can pick it up with the other hand . I would like it much better if after the bread is toast I can just get my bread out.  I do like the way it looks  and the settingsthe toaster has . I do not like the bread not lifting higher from the slots then it does. For me I would not buy this again.
