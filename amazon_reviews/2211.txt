I was intrigued by the concept of this weird looking contraption on the pages of Amazon. Soon I read the reviews and placed an order. The facts soon dampened my enthusiasm. The eggs crooked perfectly but the toast never toasted, it just dried out. I liked the concept so well I was willing to accept a replacement and return the original. (Anyone who has used Amazon's return policy, understands how easy it is to get satisfaction). The replacement came and did all that was hyped in the adds. We admit that it is one of our most used appliances. It has spoiled us with higher quality egg and muffins than available from any fast food restaurant. Don't hesitate to own one the remarkable devices.
