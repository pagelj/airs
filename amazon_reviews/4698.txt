Bought this coffee maker a few weeks ago and have used it every day since.  It looks great with our new stainless appliances and works very well.  Overall, my favorite thing about this coffee maker, and this may sound trivial, is that the carafe pours cleanly and doesn't dribble coffee or water all over everything when pouring a cup or filling the reservoir.  The carafes on most coffee makers are poorly designed and make a big mess any time you try to pour from them. This machine is pretty simple to use and makes a good cup of coffee.  The adjustable shut off timer is a nice function, as is the adjustable temp control.  The button for brewing 4 or fewer cups is also a nice feature. My quibbles are minor.  First, the openings to fill the reservoir are a little small, making adding water somewhat more difficult than our prior Braun machine.  But, the excellent carafe design allows me to fill the reservoir without getting water all over the counter, which I sometimes did with the Braun maker despite the large opening to the reservoir.  My second quibble is that the removable filter housing will stand up on the counter, as the Braun's would.  As a result, you have to put the housing in the maker, insert the filter and add coffee to the filter while in the machine.  I could set the Braun's housing on the counter, fill the filter, and then insert the housing into the maker.  Not a big deal, but it is easier to fill the housing when it standing alone on the counter, especially if pouring coffee from a grinder. Despite these minor quibbles, I like the coffee maker a lot.
