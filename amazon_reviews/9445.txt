Very stiff mount, does not have level ability, 1 star
I am a Taskrabbit and I help many many people with mounting TV's, and one of my customers had purchased this mount and already had it at their home, I went to the home and started to drill the holes in the studs in the walls, got the mount up quick, got the TV up on the mount, everything went perfectly, BUT!!! When you pull the TV out and when you turn the TV to the left or the right on the arm the TV appears tilted, this mount does not have the level ability so you can level the TV when you turn it to the left or right, That made things confusing, the mounting plate on the wall was 100 percent level, and also trying to pull the articulating arm away from the wall is hard, you may have to loosen the bolts on the arm, but thats not a good idea because over time the bolts will loosen even more and the Arm will fall off with your TV. so I had to take this mount down,I ordered a different mount from amazon that had level ability and WAHLAH!!! It worked like a charm. the mount I ordered was VideoSecu Articulating Full Motion TV Wall Mount for 32"-65" LED LCD Plasma TVs with VESA up to 600x400 mm, Dual Arm pulls out up to 25 Inch, with Leveling Adjustments, Bonus 10 ft HDMI Cable A37
