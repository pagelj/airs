I shouldn't have waited so long
when i found the cover on amazon and used i thought i'd take a chance, such a good price, i could lose $6.00 bucks if it was really crappy, however surprise was an understatement. The cover came in its original package, it was excellant and i would not live without it now. The shipping charges were as much as the item that Sucked
