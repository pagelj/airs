It is completely dead
I bought this item through Amazon, from this store. It worked pretty well for like a month, mayfe 45 days. But that was IT. I DON'T Have any conectivity from any port, Ethernet doesn't work, wireless doesn't work.... I am very upset. Now I Think I will make a phone call to know If I can use the guarantee so they can replace it. As someone said in this reviews, they don't test the quality of this router, because it is not the firt time something like this happens with this specific ROUTER from Asus. I thought it was going to be the best. But now I am dissapointed.
