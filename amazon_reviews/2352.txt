Outstanding.
It has just about every app you could want from a video player. The 3d picture is amazing, but I guess that would depend on your TV. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, tons of other audio and video players. I can't imagine paying any less for a player and getting everything they packed into this one. I see no reason to ever pay more for one.
