From a person who hasn't lived though the 80s
This novel is filled with allusions to prior video games, books, movies, and nostalgia but even without catching the references it doesn't deter from the book. It's very well written and makes you want to sit down and finish it all in one gulp! Somebody once asked me to relate this book to others and it's a tall tale but it's one parts hunger games, one part . hack//sign and one gallon of the era of the 80s with a touch of adventure, romance, and pac-man.
