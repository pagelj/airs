Perfect!
I can't really add much more to the reviews that have already been written. This product is sturdy, solid, and holds my 2010 MacBook Pro 15' at a perfect angle for me. I was having back pain from hunching over to gaze at my laptop screen, and this product, for me, is the perfect solution. The storage space underneath the laptop is very helpful, as well. Really a great product, and well worth the price.
