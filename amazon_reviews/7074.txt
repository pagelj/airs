Purchased these for my mom as a Christmas Gift. I asked her how she liked them, and her response was "they are perfect!".... They arrived right on time within the shipping time frame and was just in time to be given as a Christmas gift. They are very sharp and I was a bit worried about the quality since the knife itself is VERY light weight. But they are sturdy and sharp! Great set for the price!
