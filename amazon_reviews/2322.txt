DONT BUY THIS ITEM
As a first time Amazon costumer, I bought about 6 USB Sync and Charging compatible cables because I knew I was getting what I payed for. Never again will I order from Amazon. Half of the cables came broken and would not charge my iphone or sync it. the other half did not fit my iphone. i would have to force it in and out of my iphone causing damages to it and eventually ripping the cable apart. DONT BUY THIS ITEM.
