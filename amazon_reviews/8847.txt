A decent replacement for Netflix streaming
We got tired of paying for the Netflix streaming, when all of the movies were old and tired and rerun time after time. The Roku's selection really isn't any better, but it is much cheaper over time since you only purchase once and no monthly fees. We did have a lot of difficulty with streaming at first and then found a "sweet spot" for the wireless reception which is on the side of the cabinet a few feet above the television. I don't think the receptors in the unit itself are very strong because every other component in the same room has a strong signal with the wireless.
