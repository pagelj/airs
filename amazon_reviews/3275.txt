Great knife set
This is a great knife set.  I have been very happy with the quality of the knives since receiving them.  The handles are very comfortable when utilizing them and the blades are extremely sharp.  I do recommend hand washing these and not keeping them in water (such as soaking) to avoid rust spots on the utensils.
