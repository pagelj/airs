Wish I could give ZERO stars
When it works, it is marginally good in terms of picture and sound quality.  About a week ago (right when the return window closed) it stopped holding a charge... the battery no longer works and hence, it cannot be unplugged and hence cannot be moved.  Very low quality.  I wish Amazon would give me an exception for a return, especially since it is only a few days past the last chance to send it back.
