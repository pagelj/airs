Ultimate External Battery - Great product, great shipping, holds charge for multiple days
The title says it all, this is the Ultimate External Battery - it is truly a Great product, great shipping, holds charge for multiple days.  I used this product for a trip to Australia from Philadelphia (nearly 30 hours of traveling).  I flew with a friend and charged, recharged and recharged again both of our ipads and iphone's..... After traveling Australia for two weeks, we wanted to fully recharge our New Trent device and it was 2/3 of the way still charged... Really impressive product, it was worth the $75 for the trip alone, I just hope it last for the future.  No question asked if you are traveling internationally - you need this external battery, no questions asked.  I had another one that was cheap, (from NoMorerack. com) it broke after one charge, and nomorerack. com - gave no refund and did not replace after 20 days (apparently they have a 14 day policy)
