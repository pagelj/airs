The cartridge I received IS an authentic Brother product
There have been some reviews stating that this product isn't a bonafide Brother TN450 Toner Cartridge. I can only assure you that the toner cartridge I received on November 16, 2012 certainly is a genuine Brother cartridge. There is even a little hologram-type sticker on the package that states it is a genuine Brother part. And if it works as well as the Brother HL-2270DW Compact Laser Printer I'm using it with, I'm sure I'll be very satisfied with my purchase.
