It only costs a dollar for a reason
When I plugged it in and turned on my xbox, my TV didn't get a signal from it at all. After a few restarts it started working. After 5 minutes of using it however, the signal starts to flicker annoyingly on and off. Don't waste the money on this, spend your money on something with quality.
