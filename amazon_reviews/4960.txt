An excellent 3-star book
I love the Song of Ice and Fire series, though A Feast for Crows suffered from "Robert Jordan Syndrome" - in other words, splitting the narrative into too many viewpoint characters meant that the pacing of the plot slowed to a crawl. So much so that this book is really the second half of A Feast For Crows. This book is better. The writing is engaging (Tyrion is hilarious as hell in this book, even when being emo) and I care more about the characters in this book than in the other. Buuuuuttttt... the plot goes nowhere. GRRM sets up a wonderful predicament for Daenerys in her conquered city. In fact, it is the main plotline of the book. And yet... everything is exactly as it was at the start of the book. The plot doesn't advance. In fact, if you picture the world as a chessboard, between the beginning and the end of the book, only a few pieces have moved. A couple have been removed, a couple have been added, but for all of the extreme length of the book, nothing really happens. It's a shame really, since it was actually a very enjoyable read, much more so than A Feast For Crows. Except for a couple wonderful (and horrible) plot twists, you could easily skip this book, read a one-page summary, and wait for The Winds of Winter.
