Its a hit for my 2 year old
my daughter received this as a gift on her 2nd birthday and she seems to really like it. So far she has learned how to do the "b" sound. The toy seems very durable, even though we only had it since valentine's day and now its early march. The only thing i wasn't happy about was the screen resolution. Its kind of hard to see, you have to tilt the screen a certain way.
