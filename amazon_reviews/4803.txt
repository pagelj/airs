Bad deal. Do not buy
I have used two Samsung phones before now and I was sold out on the fact that ALL their products are good. But I got a shocker of my life a few hours after this phone was delivered. The product which I bought for my daughter who lives outside the US was virtually dead on arrival - It took ages to get the battery charged and several hours to power the phone on. The worst experience I had was that each time I managed to power the phone on (and it takes a lot of pushing, pressing and fumbling with the power on key) the screen goes blank and black. I was so frustrated that I actually decided to return the product but after realizing that I might not get a replacement before my wife traveled out of the US, I decided to send the half-dead phone to my daughter with the hope that she could get some repair work done on it For now I have resolved that any product that goes by the name SAMSUNG should be avoided like a plague.
