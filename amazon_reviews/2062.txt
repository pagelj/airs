dog backpack
I already have the kurgo harness and love it,so their backpack was exactly what I was looking for! Quality is excellent and fits my dog comfortably. I have a cattle dog and as a working breed they have the need to "work",so I place a bottle of water on each side and this way he works and also gets drinks along the way!
