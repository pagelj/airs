Popcorn one touch button is just to strong for a bag of popcorn! I was hoping the extra power would get those last unpopped kernels and it did. burnt popcorn is what you get! there is a less/more button which either adds time or subtracts time. I tried it with the second or most time subtracted and got a lot of unpopped kernels. one less and the corn is slightly scorched. I'm still playing with it and cook most thing at 60% power or 1/2 the time at full power. The unit is very quite and all in all I'm happy with it. Just a little learning curve to go through.
