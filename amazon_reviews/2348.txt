Good Camera but a but puzzled
I bought this camera for $199 Saturday August 3, and looked again the next day and the price had dropped by $30. Thankfully I was able to cancel the order and order the camera at the lower price. The camera is impressive for normal home use, but one thing really puzzles me and that is I bought the 16 gig memory card and found out that much memory will only give you 1 hour of HD movie recording, this is, no doubt, due to the . MOV format. Come on Cannon, you can do better than that, MPEG 4 as far as I can tell is free.. I am very dissapointed as managing with this aspect as files this large eat up a large amount of memory not only on your camera but your computer as well.
