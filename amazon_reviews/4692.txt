Excellent power charger for different kind of devices
This ac power charger has worked great on different devices I've used, not all chargers charge all devices, with this one there's not a mobile device a haven't been able to charge. The devices I charged are Blackberrys, IPods, IPhones, Motorola i940 (it has the same MHz as most Motorola phones), IPads, Nokia (different kinds)  It's also practical with 2 USB ports, and having used several over a period of 3-4 months, I can tell they're durable as well. I got at $11.99 so it's a good bargain. Highly recommended !
