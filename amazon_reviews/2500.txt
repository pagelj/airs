Great zoom lens
Well, I'm not a professional photographer. As a matter of fact, I bought my first DSLR camera 1 week ago (a Nikon D7000) and bought this lens together, to get the Amazon/Nikon discount, and boy, I have to say I don't regret it at all! This is an awesome lens! I took it to a baseball game and a football game and I could get pretty close-up pictures! It could be a bit faster, but for this price, that's ok. If you need a complementary lens for your kit, take it!
