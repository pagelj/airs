Good camera but Wifi function is not mature enough
I brought this camera for it's WiFi feature since i have many DSC already. I have no complain about picture or video quality but Wireless function is difficut to use. Well, I think it's not their fault, basically, WiFi direct is a new technology so it have long way to go. Think about it. If we can take pictures or video and easily transfer to cell Phone and send to cloud or hosting site. Life will be much easier this way yet the transmittion is too slow especially video. I think I will wait for other technology come out to do video transfer though wireless.
