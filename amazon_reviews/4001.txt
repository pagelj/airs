Very Nice Tablet
I feel like I made the correct choice by purchasing this tablet.  It is very nice to use and is similar to my Samsung Exhibit Android phone which influenced me in making my decision.  I started using the tablet as soon as I turned it on without even referring to the booklet.  I like technology but I am not as experienced as many "techy" people are. I learn as I go, hands on learning, and I enjoy it.  So I am having a good experience with this tablet. It is very responsive to the touch and it has many good features, I still have a lot of things to do on this tablet and I feel confident that I will enjoy having and using it.
