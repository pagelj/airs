Fabulous
Writers have a rule. You should be able to state the idea behind your novel in one sentence of twenty-five words or less.  It's the 'what if' rule. It forms the first sentence of your cover letter to a publishing house, meant to inspire others with the vision of the stories that could be told from that one enticing idea.  In Scott Card's story, it would be ... What if a six-year-old, genetically engineered, child could be trained to destroy the race that threatens mankind's existence? ... Laughable, except he pulls it off, marvelously.  In rare cases, a writer of exceptional talent is able to take an idea that seems implausible and create in his audience the hope that this idea can, in fact, be accomplished. In Ender's Game, Scott Card accomplishes this rare feat with astonishing ease.  It was a story I was sad to see end.
