Great phone with one design flaw
I won't leave a long detailed review - plenty of others have done that. I'm really enjoying the upgrade from my Incredible 2. However there is a design flaw in this phone that's pretty annoying. The volume button and the power button are directly across from each other, on opposite sides of the phone. Whenever I want to change the volume, I accidentally turn the phone off because my hand naturally holds the phone at the same spot on both sides. And if I'm looking to turn off the phone, I frequently hit the volume first. Having both on the same side or one on top and the other on a side would fix this issue. This issue aside, I love the camera (even though I had heard it was this phone's weak spot), love the voice commands, and haven't had any connectivity issues. Last, I really miss the HTC homepage widget. I wish someone would create an Android app that does the same thing. Accurate weather that animates the current conditions (love the windshield wiper!) and gives the hi & lo temp plus the timestamp. I miss my windshield wiper on rainy days. Yes, I really am that shallow.
