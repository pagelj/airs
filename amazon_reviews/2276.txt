Why are there so many 5 star ratings?
I am wondering how people rate these products five stars when you have yet to use it.  I can only give you 3 stars as all you did is send me an email.  If my product breaks and I need help then I will adjust it.  It is frustrating for people who really want to know how the service was. I hope I never ever have to use this, but if i do I will provide a more accurate review of the service and time it took for Sqaured Trade to fix my lalptop
