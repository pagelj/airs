great so far
Pros Lots of good features like remote camera adjustment, night vision, music, and microphone so you can talk to the child Monitor is not too big and the video can be turned off while still using the audio No static. I have had problems with other audio monitors and my wireless network, but not this one. Cons Only comes with one monitor and I haven't been able to find a place to purchase a second one Battery life on the monitor a little too short, but still not too bad Has an annoying little blue light when it is charging and a green one when it is on A little pricey, but so are all video monitors. I just spent a little extra to get one that had more features and a color screen
