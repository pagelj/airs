Easy to read reference
This book is easy to read and is plastered with the author's dry but witty humor. The author's humor coupled with the light-hearted down-to-earth approach make this book very amusing and easy to read. The book does not cover the technical aspects of photography, such as aperture, ISO and shutter speed setting in grand detail - which the author pointed out is not the goal of this book. Think of this book as a personal companion or a quick reference guide filled with scene-specific techniques on how, what, where and when to shoot in different situations. Not only does the book answer the previous sets of what/where/when/how questions, but also the why. For example, why shoot a photograph of a flower on your knees instead of standing up? Why diffused lighting works best for floral shots and why you should include a foreground, a middleground and a background in landscape photography. Kelby makes seemingly general techniques that once seem mundane to the average photographer/photo-viewer now an indespenable tool of the trade. The author's chapter on photo gear recommendation near the beginning of the book is also a plus for beginning photographers. Although this book is geared toward D-SLR users, the techniques employed can also be used for point-and-shoot compact users as well. Remember, this book's main objective lies in the techniques of digital photography and its compositions, not the techinical configuration of a camera. All in all, this book is one of the few photography books that deserve a spot in my photography library collection.
