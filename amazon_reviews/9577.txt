I wanted a small light vacuum for use exclusively around the litter box in the "cat room" of my house. This fits the bill perfectly.  It is very light and was inexpensive.  It picks up tons of litter and cat fur.  It can't pick up larger items (cat food bits etc) but that wasnt what I bought it for so I cant really complain.
