Item does NOT work
Don't buy this defective product. After installed and plugged my iphone in, serveral issues found:There's white line appeared on the top corner of the screen. The screen is very hot to the touch around the top area of the phone near the ear phoneThe iphone refused to boot up with this screen. I tried to get my refunds through the seller. First he asked me to send him a picture of the phone. Did that and he wanted me to send it back to China for a replacement.  Send this item to Chinafrom US cost at least $15 for shipping which doesn't covered by the seller. This is ridiculous. I filed a refund request and again the company representative replied with asking me to sendit to China for a replacement.  Will never buy anything again from this seller. Called Amazon and try to get this resolve.  Will see what happen.
