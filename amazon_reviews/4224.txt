***DO NOT buy this if you have kids!!***
I bought this camera because it is a Nikon so I thought I could trust that it would be good.  This camera is such a bummer!  Even in front of a large window, this camera takes blurry photos.  The very slightest movement by a child (and what child sits totally still??) results in a terrible, hazy image.  I really only use the camera outside; I rely on my phone to take indoor pictures and they turn out much nicer. Nikon customer service told me to make sure to take pictures with more natural light or use the flash; such genius advice!!  My next camera will be a Canon.  Do not buy this one!
