no power cord
When I first bought my kindle and got the charger... it came with a much needed power cord attached to it.... the power cord got broken, so I ordered another charger, ASSUMING it would be the same as the original, being that it has a power cord attached.............. only to find that you trick people  into having to order more.  I don't have a power cord that should be attached to Accelerated Charger.,. a waste of my $$$ and I won't be ordering the power cord through you and giving you more $$$ for something I should have gotten already..,.,,Elaine Libby
