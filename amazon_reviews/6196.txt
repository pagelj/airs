I have always wanted a Dyson with a ball for maneuverability, but it was new on the market when I purchased my last Dyson and not available in stores, yet.  I couldn't wait for it to arrive on store shelves because my other vacuum had died, so I purchased the DC14 Animal and loved it from the start!  This year was my chance to "upgrade" and my daughter is thrilled that she is getting a killer deal on my older model Dyson which still works like new!  I do love the maneuverability of the ball style and the amazing suction of the DC41 that cleans up all the pet hair, including my black lab's wiry stuff that becomes one with my light colored carpet. It also comes with a great assortment of attachments! My only criticism is that I wish the canister was a bit bigger so I wouldn't have to empty it so often (it seems smaller than my DC14) and that you REALLY have to be sure that the click you hear when you stand the vacuum upright is the one that holds it in that position or you risk having the vacuum fall over. But..... I LOVE it!
