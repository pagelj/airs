I have a boxer and was surprised by how much he sheds! This vaccumm is perfect for vacumming his dog bed and blankets. The attachment makes it so easy because it has a rubber "wheel" inside to help pull up the dog hair.  The suction on this vaccumm is great, too. I am pleased that there are features that cater for those who have pets that shed a lot!
