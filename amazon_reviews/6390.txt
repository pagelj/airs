Best value available
Most of the articulating wall mounts that I was looking at online were much more expensive than this, so I was glad to find this product and figured if I did not like it I could return it.  I am VERY happy with it, in fact the computer screen is mounted to the wall right now and it is great.  Don't bother paying more for another brand when this works just find and is a GREAT value.  I highly recommend this product if your screen meets the VESA 100/75 specs and is within the size range.
