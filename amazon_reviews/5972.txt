This vacumn is lightweight and versitle for me to handle. It cleans very well. I like how I can use it by hand. It is lightweight. I am finding out it is probably the best vacumn I have ever used. I will certainly recommend it to my friendShark Navigator Professional Lift-Away Vacuum Cleaner - Model NV356Es.
