Great Laptop
My son got this when he was two. Unfortunetly he already knew his abc's and the sounds they made, so I didnt think he would be interested. Wrong. Its not in any means an everyday play toy for my son. I think he just likes that mommy congratulates him so much when he knows what animal makes that sound or how to say the letter sound without pressing buttons. Very durable to. It has been thrown about alot. Would make a great car toy. Good for toddlers learning there abc's.
