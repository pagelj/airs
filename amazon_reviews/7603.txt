We have had two of these DTC-975 pots. The first one (white) was damaged in a household move. We ordered a black one and are so very pleased. Yes, it takes a few coffee spills all over the counter to learn to seat the lid and or carafe properly, but it is worth the lessons. Set the timer and when we get up, the coffee is hot and ready. We make two pots a day and drink every drop. It is never burned or cold, no more heating in the microwave in the afternoon. We are ordering another pot for his office since I don't want to give up the one in the kitchen.  Worth the price, the coffee on the counter and learning to set the time after the paint wears off the buttons on the bottom.
