Video 2 PC
The Video 2 PC converter worked great.  I was able to get all my old VHS recordings transfered to my hard drive.  The only problem I had was with my older Dell laptop.  My Dell is about 5-1/2 years old and the video card could not handle the graphics from the Video 2 PC.  I hooked it my to my wife's newer HP laptop and everthing downloaded perfect.  I just wished I would have backed up my wife's laptop.  The hard drive crashed 4 days after I converted all my VSH tapes.  I guess I get to test this device again.
