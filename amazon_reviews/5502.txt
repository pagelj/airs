Well worth the buy
This product is well worth the money, I moved from England to American bringing with me my DVd collection, when getting here realised that my DVD's wouldn't play on an American DVD player, not wanting to buy all my DVD's again i searched the web for a muti regional player and found this one, all i have to do is pop in the DVD not matter what the region and hey presto it plays, no hassles with changing regions it does it for you.
