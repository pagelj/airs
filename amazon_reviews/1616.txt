Lots of fun for adorable price
I purchased this camera for a trip to Florida Keys. Have read lots of reviews, some were bad, some were good. I was a little anxious about how waterproof the camera is and it was doing its job surprisingly well. I was thinking about a waterproof case for my canon 40d and now I'm happy I bought a small waterproof camera instead. It was fun. I didn't like the brightness of its screen, all my shots were like blind shots - I didn't see anything under the bright sun, that's why its just four. Probably it would be better if I had a mask but I didn't. Anyway, I expected much less quality than I get. I did like that there was no drops on the lens after I get it out from the water. No zoom but it didn't bother me. Flash - very helpful. Serial shots (without flash) - I used that as well. It takes pictures almost at the time I press the button, it doesn't spend time on focusing. I would definitely recommend this camera, I think it is really good for saving the memories of underwater fun.
