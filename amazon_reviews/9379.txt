We live in a 2-bedroom apartment that is mostly carpeted and this vacuum cleaner is perfect for it!  It is lighter, less noisy, more manueverable and just as powerful as my old Eureka that only lasted for less than 6 months.  For the price we paid for it, it's definitely a good deal.  Now I vacuum the apartment more often than I used to.
