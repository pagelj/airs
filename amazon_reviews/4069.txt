Happy but Not Happy
I have the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen1. So I figured the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen2 would be better. Not so. It has all of the bells and whistles and it has a nice screen. You can read kindle/amazon books but. This is what makes me very unhappy. I have a 32g micro sdcard. Download ebooks on it. Samsung Galaxy 7 gen2 will not let you open them. You have to use the Reader Hub to open ebooks if they are not Amazon books, it does not give you an option to open the ebooks on your ext sdcard. I have surfed the internet for 2 days and have come across posting that tells you it can not be done. I am not downing Samsung. I have the Samsung Galaxy 10 gen1 and the Samsung Galaxy SIII Phone and a 46" Samsung TV plus the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen1. So no way am I downing Samsung. If someone can tell me how to open ebooks from the Ext SD Card before tomorrow (10-19-2012) then I would be more then glad to keep it. The other problem I have with the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen2. When I am more then 15' from my wireless Router the internet is dropped. I have the Kindle Reader, Kindle Fire gen1, and all of the above tablets and they all stay connected up to 40-50 ft.
