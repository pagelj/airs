I bought this a few years ago when Consumer Reports listed this as a Best Buy. For under $100, this Hoover Tempo Widepath truly outperforms vacuums in the $300-500 range! PROS- This works well on thick carpet, berber carpet, tile, and hardwood- After about a hundred uses, this still sucks strongly (literally)- Compared with other uprights, this is relatively lighter; works great on stepsCONS- Not a huge fan of bag vacuums but this works fineOVERALLAt this price, I'm tempted to buy another one!
