First the latch, then the hinge broke.  Don't waste your money.
Did a good job on two sandwiches then broke: the clasp that holds the two handles together broke.  It wasn't stuffed full, either, just two thin sheets of meat and a slice of cheese.  So I figured, I'd just hold it together by the handle while it cooked.  Another few uses and the metal casting broke in the back that serves as the hinge.  So instead of holding both sides together and burning my hands I just threw it in the garbage. Don't waste your money, try something that will hold together longer.
