Nice protection for surface
Although this is meant to reduce glare, I like that it protects the screen on the fire, and keeps smears from occurring.  It was easy to install.  I bought it new because I don't know how a used one would work, as it does attach to the front of the Kindle Fire by means of adhesive.  However the biggest detractor is the cost which is why it's only getting four stars.  It does what it's supposed to do, but at a hefty price point.
