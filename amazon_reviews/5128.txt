I am very happy with how it works.  In the past when I had a Eureka and a Bissell, I tested vacuums by vacuuming the first time, then a second to see how much it actually picks up. The performing the same test a week later or so.  I liked that the receptacle had a lot of of hair and dirt to empty out on the Bissell and that when I vacummed again it was almost none to empty out. Now a days I vacuum a couple of time a week because I have a lab that sheds his size every couple of days!  Basically, I am very happy with this vacuum :)
