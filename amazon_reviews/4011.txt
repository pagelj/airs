Great durable phone
This toy phone is great. My 16 month old loves it and knows just how to use it. We have Scout the dog that is the same voice that is on this phone.  She is pretty tough on her toys and this phone has been dropped a few times and doesn't seem worse for wear.  I really looked to find something for her that seemed realistic but durable and this phone is still the best I've seen.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is no lighting on it. If it blinked when it rang or had some backlight it would get 5 stars.  But overall it's a great toy and lots of fun.
