parts missing - all else as stated
I received this mount yesterday.  It did NOT include an HDMI cable or a Level.  The only level was built into the mount.  You need to remove a cover to expose the in-laid level.  Cheetah was embossed on the lower bracket. Very well packed.  The brown box was shipped inside a much larger brown box with a lot of filler material.  Hard to imagine better packaging. Product arrived in great condition and included all the hardware required.  It is a basic mount that supports my 50" Plasma perfectly.  No frills.4 star as the HDMI and magnetic level were NOT included.
