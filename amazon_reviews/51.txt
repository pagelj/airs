I'm using this computer to write this review.
It's a good computer. I use it for everything. It has never had any issues except that it will sometimes not play audio while loading a separate page. I think this is due to internet connection anyways. It has many conveniences not found on other computers, such as an autocorrect feature on any and all typing (including this). I am not disappointed it can't run games or cds, because it was so cheap. This computer would be worth 350. A fourth the price of a normal laptop for 90% of the value.
