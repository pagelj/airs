can't put it down.
This book was recommended to me by a friend who said it was "by far better than the hunger games". I couldn't believe that, because I love the hunger games trilogy. So of course I had to see for myself. I discovered that she may be right. :) the hunger games is just as good as it ever was. But this book is crazy good. I couldn't put it down. I went straight from Divergent onto Insurgent as soon as I got to the end. I am glad the 2nd book was already out when I read the first, because I hate to wait. But sadly I still have to wait for the 3rd (it's already preordered for my kindle!) I read both books again right after reading them the first time. It's really just something I usually do. If its worth doing, it's worth overdoing, right? I've, since, read them at least one more time.. Reading them the 2nd and 3rd times, they are still just as hard to put down. Definitely read this book. And be prepared to read the next one (Insurgent)... and go ahead and preorder the last (Allegiant) :)
