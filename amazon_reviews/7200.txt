It does not seem to cook as fast as previous Panasonic I owned and it makes louder noise when cooking than previous one.  It seems to be longer and not as tall as previous one.  With width and length, it just did fit on my counter.  I wish it had a handle to open it with rather than push button style.  After searching and looking at different microwaves, I was pleased with price of this one.  I have always been pleased with Panasonic products.
