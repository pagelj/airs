I love this trash can. I will never go back to step flip lids (step always breaks in the end) or swing top lids (which always get food splattered on them and end up smelling). It opens quickly, is just the right amount of sensitivity (so it only opens when you want to throw something away, not every time you walk by), and it closes within a few seconds. You can also press buttons next to the sensor to keep it open or closed. Because it closes firmly any offensive odors emanating from the trash are contained. I also really like that it has a ring that fits over the trash bag to keep it in place. Only complaints are that it arrived dented, and it takes 4 D batteries which are not included.
