HATE IT
This item arrived damaged. I opened the package and tried to snap some photos I saw a crack on it and was unable to see the LCD screen. I was very disappointed. As I did not purchase a protection plan I felt it was a waste of time trying to return the item. I had to order another camera. Very upsetting to order a new item and find it damaged upon opening.
