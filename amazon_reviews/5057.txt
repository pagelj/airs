Good sturdy cheap mount
Hung my 42" LCD on the wall just fine.  4 stars was because the HDMI cable that came with it was bad, but the mount was perfect.  I didn't read the directions, so I can't comment on those, but I had installed mounts similar (and more expensive) at work recently, so I pretty much knew what I was doing anyway.
