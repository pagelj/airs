Easy to use
After having no luck with Roxio, I decided to try this to convert my VHS tapes to digital.  After reading the reviews here, I purchased it.  Am very pleased, it's very easy to use.  The software could use a better look and feel (but that is because I'm a designer and picky about that), but it works fine.  I had to contact them a couple of time regarding questions I had - but they either answered the phone right away - or I was able to leave a message and they did call me back as promised in less than 30 minutes!  Would highly recommend this product! One technical glitch I had, you should plug the cords into the back of your VCR - not the front.
