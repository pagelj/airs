Great gadget, but loses functionality overseas
The first one I got was DOA.  However, this appears to be the exception, and Amazon had a replacement to me quickly. Installation was a snap, and I was up and streaming within 15 minutes.  There are more channels then I could ever watch, but most of them are independent/foreign stuff of dubious quality.  The Plex channel allowed me to stream my own content with an Apple TV-esque feel.  iTunes synced right up.  Setting up downloaded content took a bit of a learning curve (naming conventions and folder structures), but once I figured it out it works like a champ. Unfortunately, I miss out on the best features because I am military stationed in Korea.  None of the good stuff works here (Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime are all disabled here).  There may be a way to make them work, but my geek quotient isn't high enough. Overall, I love my Roku.  It is well worth the money, despite not being able to use Netflix.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
