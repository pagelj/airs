Locked down and unbreakable
I got this along with the TimeCapsule 2 in hopes of being able to stream my movies from one to the other directly.  Turns out it will only stream media from a computer running iTunes.  That greatly limits the formats that can be played and is a pain having to turn on a new device.  Worst of all, you can't jailbreak this model so for me, it was practically useless.
