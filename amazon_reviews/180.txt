I am well pleased with my Black & Decker 4-Slice Stainless-Steel Toaster. For the price it can't be beat! It seems a little slower than most toasters but I am willing to wait a little longer for something that is evenly toasted and this toaster is good at that. The cord is fully retractable and it is cool to the touch. It has large enough slots for bagels and texas toast. Large touch buttons for reheating or cancellation plus buttons for frozen products or bagels. Also has two knobs with adjustable settings for toasting two or four slices. I find that setting 4 is best for toast but that would depend on how well you like it toasted. There are crumb trays under each side which slide out easily for cleaning. I really love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new toaster.
