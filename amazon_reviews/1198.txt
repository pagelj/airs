No pulley in the middle
I received this purse as a Christmas gift from my loving husband a couple years ago. He did not buy it from Amazon. However, it randomly it showed up in Amazon's Best Sellers list today. I will be reviewing the purse, not Amazon's awesome service. The purse is pretty great. It holds up well, easy to clean (rubber), and roomy. I may not have bought this for myself because of the following reasons, which are also why I gave the purse 4 stars.-I like a little smaller purse, especially with short handles.-I prefer handles I can put on my shoulder.-The opening, as mentioned in almost every other review, is small. I do enjoy carrying Billina around. She certainly turns heads! When my husband wrapped the purse for Christmas, he cleverly filled it with plastic Easter eggs. This was very fun! I use one of those eggs as a change purse! As I mentioned in a comment, I also like to set my ringtone to some sort of chicken noise. It just seems like the right thing to do. All-in-all I recommend this purse if you are someone who likes to make a statement with accessories.
