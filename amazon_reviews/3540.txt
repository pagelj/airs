an extra set of eyes
I purchased this item to keep an eye on my newly adopted 7 year old son. He has ADHD and many nights would not stay in bed. He now knows that I have an extra set of eyes on him. Many nights he will lie in bed and watch the monitor, but no longer gets out of bed. I have had it for over a month and it was worth every penny I paid for it.
