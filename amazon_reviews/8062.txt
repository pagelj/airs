Does Work
I was somewhat doubtful that this would really work, but it does.  I've had a few gliches but some had to do with defective DVD discs.  The Quick Set Up was amazing easy.  It is very easy to record and burn.  My major complaint is that it shows the movie on a very small screen while recording, but playback of the DVD, does use the the whole screen.  My VHS/DVD recorder/player stopped recording, which is why I bought the homestech.  Simply attach (VHS or DVD) machine and computer through the homestech box. That's it! The other thing I like about it, is after you burn a DVD, it offers to burn a second one, which on occassion, I do want a second one.  Burning the second DVD is no time at all.  For the price, you can't beat it.
