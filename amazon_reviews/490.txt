Not bad . . . a bit clunky interface
I heard LG was great . . . and the product works fine . . . but the interface is clunky.  It won't save multiple wireless networks, so if you switch, you have to key in the passphrase EVERY time.  If you reset the machine, you have to reenter the WiFi passphrase . . . getting it up & running, I probably entered my 13 letter passphrase 10 times & doing so with the remote was a ROYAL pain in the patuty.  The apps looked kinda hokey too . . . not a lot of value add on the downloadable apps that I could see . . . after a couple days of playin' with this thing . . . it's alright . . . but I liked the SONY interface much better.(EDIT) . . . LOST A STAR . . . it wouldn't read a couple home burned DVDs that the SONY it replaced read easily . . . the SONY it replaced (due to the integrated wireless & cheap price of this unit) is now BACK in place & if I can return this, I probably will . . .
