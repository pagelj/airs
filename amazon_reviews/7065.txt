Absolutely incredible
If you like fiction then this a must read. I picked Hyperion off the shelf by luck and for the next two days I did not answer the phone. It is one of the best books I have ever read and definitely the best sci-fi. The story  is compelling, incredible and brilliant. There is no adequate way to  describe how good this book is. Read it, 'nuff said.
