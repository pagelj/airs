Cheaper is NOT Better... Stick with Canon Brand
I purchased an off-brand battery for my Canon Rebel XT a few months ago from a local dealer.  After using it for about 3 months, it would charge up in 10 minutes and wouldn't stay charged for more than 5 shots.  I was furious. My Canon NB-2LH Rechargeable Battery Pack, however, stays charged for 1000s of shots and takes less than 2 hours to fully charge.  Although it is quite a bit more expensive than the one I bought previously, its reliability was worth the money.
