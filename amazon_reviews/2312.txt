Dresden Files DVD First Season
Books are fantastic!  Did not know about the show until after the writer's strike and by then the first season I am assuming was over and have not seen any others added.  Was a bit disappointed with the changes in the characters from the book.  I do not think it enhanced the show at all but was disappointing.  The actor portraying Dresden does an OK job but just does not fit the character physically.  Bob I am also disappointed with.  I love the talking skull.  Susan and Murphy are all wrong too.  The writing for the story of the show has been good, and I would recommend this DVD series if you can stray yourself away from what was written.  Harry Potter movies are not only good because they are great books, but the movies follow the books and what the characters are suppose to be like.  I think that is what readers like to see when they see a movie/shows of books they have read.
