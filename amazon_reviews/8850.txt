easy set up, tiny
This box is really small!  You can put it anywhere.  I don't have an HDTV and it was a cinch to attached the 3 in 1 cable.  The only complaint is that I have a complex WIFI password and it was difficult to type with the remote.  But once it was set up, we were watching Amazon Prime videos in moments.
