Good, not Great
Fit and finish not quite as good as previous version I had. Works fine, but does not snap in and out of holster as smoothly. Also requires some attention to keep the rubber completely fastened to the plastic frame. Nevertheless, it does good job protecting my iPhone 4S and I prefer the easy access holster over others I have tried.
