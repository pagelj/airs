tiny mouse for a big change
Having used this mouse for 2 weeks, I thought it was time I could offer a decent review. Overall I really like this mouse. I bought it on a whim, as the price was so low. I have done information system work for 3 decades and have used an awful lot of mice, many of which were indeed awful. I actually got a mild case of carpal tunnel from a very badly designed trackball, the pain went away when I threw it away. I provide these facts so readers will understand I know a bit about mice. This mouse is small, well designed, works well and is a pleasure to use. The fact that the wireless usb dongle docks inside the mouse when not in use is a great idea. The satin finish on the outside is very nice and comfortable to the touch. The optical laser works well and I use it on carpet, sofa, coffe table, just about anywhere I want. It is 99% of the time recognized on boot up without having to resynch. I have not yet had to change batteries, but battery life is always an issue on wireless devices. I want to switch to rechargeable batteries so I can try the charger capabilities which are built into the mouse. The only weak spot is that the mouse will not function as a mouse with the usb charging cable plugged in, which seems silly when the engineering is so good on every other count. This mouse is about 1/2 the size of a standard mouse, so if you have large hands it might be problematic to use. It works great for me and is a great accessory for my netbook. Some people complain that it breaks if you drop it, but so do Ipods and many other electronic devices, my advice is don't drop it. Its a great mouse, and I'm glad I bought it.
