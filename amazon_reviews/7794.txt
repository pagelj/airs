Not a typical thriller. Very surprising material and well written. Loved it!
I read this book straight through on a dreary rainy day. I was impressed with how well written it was. The subject matter was fascinating and odviously thoroughly researched. There were a few misspelled words but not nearly as many as most indie books. I'm checking out his website now and hope there is a sequel!!
