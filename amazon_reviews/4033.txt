Excellent blend- action, genetics, network and software hacking.
I loved the action, sciences, plot, and characters in this story.  My background in computer programming, network engineering and threat detection put a critical eye on one of the characters but I was pleasantly convinced of the character's freakish hacking abilities.  I was fascinated by the twists and turns in the story as the plot developed into a rich delicious finish that left me craving more during times when I was forced to set my Kindle down. This is a fast, edge of your seat kind of ride, the type that makes you want to get back in a long line so you can ride it again.  I cant wait for more from Mr. Richards!
