great starter item for a survival kit
I'm stationed over seas at the moment, and I have used this product twice. Once in a wet enviroment and once in a dry climate. It worked both times. It's light, easy and simplistic, it's small, I have put it through quite a bit of abuse and no damage to it so far. The only reason I gave it four stars is for the flint, it take a good amount of pressure compared to the swedish flints I've bought also.
