My first impression of the shampooer was that it had a lot of plastic parts. It was easy enough to put together, but I worry about all those plastic parts over time. It did a nice job cleaning the carpet of the dirt, but didn't do so great on stains. I plan on experimenting with some different cleaning solutions to see if I can improve upon that. The upholstery tool works well, and I like that it has a rotating brush attachment. The tool has to be inserted into the dirty water tank each time you want to use it, which is a pain. Also, when not in use, it is nearly impossible to store the hose on the machine. I have taken to simply hanging it in a closet. Also, with the hose, remember to run clean water through it after each use... you will be surprised at how much gunk is left in the hose. Overall, this seems to be a nice machine. I have used it 3-4 times in the last 3 months, and it has paid for itself.
