I've been using this toaster for about two years and it's worked fine.  I cook my toast at about 2-3 and it comes out great.  Bagels, english muffins, no problem.  The white color is pleasant looking and cheerful, and I really like the cool touch sides.  Once in a while I wish I had 2 more slots, but I wanted a small unit that wouldn't take up much room.  For the most part, I'm quite happy with it.
