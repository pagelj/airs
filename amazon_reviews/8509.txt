Don't rip yourself off... just get the 250GB unit.
This is seriously the biggest scam ever. If your serious about gaming, Netflix, arcade game downloads, or anything else you're planning to purchase this Xbox for, DON'T ! The 4 gig version isn't even catered for a moderate console user. After installing necessary updates for the console itself and then required updates for only one multi-player game, the memory unit was already full. If you're planning on purchasing an Xbox360 console, than please do yourself the favor and get the 250GB unit!!! It may seem like a good investment at first, but you'll quickly realize that you will have to purchase an additional memory unit if you hope to do anything. At that point, you'll have already spent more than just purchasing the 250GB console in the first place.
