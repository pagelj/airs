Constant companion - Good value
The Canon Powershot A1200 is wonderful... Takes good pictures and even video. Is conveniently-sized so you can always carry it with you in a pocket, purse, or attached to your belt. Has some "bells and whistles" which are easy to use. Has a handy optical viewer. And fits perfectly into a little Tamrac 5686 Ultra-Compact Digital Camera Bag which has a velcroed pocket for an extra memory card. At just under $100, the A1200 is a great deal.
