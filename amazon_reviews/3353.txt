This is bigger than I expected but just what I needed
The bag is very stylish and easy to carry. The main compartment is big enough to carry an IPAD, notebooks, and a few other things and still space enough for a tshirt or sweater if the need arises. There are plenty of pockets to hold your iphone, wallet, and car keys. This is ideal for a klutz like me who never seems to know where I put them down. Definitely recommend it. Please note: I have not overloaded it so can't tell how comfortable it would be if I was carrying a bunch of paper-books. Not that that will happen in the near future, as my book consumption is on the ereaders now. All in all, this is a real nice backpack.
