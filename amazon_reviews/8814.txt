Mud runner's dream!
I have used this for a Muck Fest and a Tough Mudder, and I *LOVE* this camera. I wear gloves for obstacle courses, but this camera is still easy to handle with them on. The separate buttons for photos and video make it easy to take both, and I get WAY better pictures without having to wait a week for a handful of mostly awful professional photos. My whole TM team really appreciated being able to have action shots of themselves throughout the course, and the camera slipped right into the zipper pocket in my compression shorts between photo opportunities. This awesome camera has been through mud, water, sand, and ice baths taking video, and I have not been disappointed. The audio quality is great, too! I highly recommend it for mud runs.
