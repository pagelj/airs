Great product so far
Just got this in the mail today and immediately put it to work.  I purchased it to use as a power source for my laptop to read an OBD2 reader in my car. This device was able to power my netbook (Asus EEE 901) and laptop (Dell Latitude  D531) just through the cigarette lighter.  I'm not quite sure exactly how the cigarette lighter was able to supply so much power without popping a fuse, but that is neither here nor there in regards to this product. As other reviewers have mentioned, the fan is always on.  This may or may not be a problem depending on how you intend to use the device. For my intended use, it is a non-issue. The only reason I gave this inverter 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the documentation.  It did come with a sheet of paper that explained the limits of the device and intended use, but failed to explain what one should do in the event of a overload or short circuit condition.  I'm not certain if it implements a fuse (I was unable to locate an inline fuse on the DC connector), or just a thermal shutdown.  It does explain that it does have both short circuit and overload protection built in though - so that is good to know. For a solid inverter that provides the correct power to your home electronics on the road, this seems to be a great deal for the money.
