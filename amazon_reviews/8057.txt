Fiction?
Although the author of this book, Ray Bradbury, is mainly known as a science fiction author, this book has become popular and infulential enough that it has had the fortune (or misfortune, depending on your politics) a standard book on English-lit courses. Thus, it is a widely read novel. That fact taken in stride, it's sad that it's message hasn't been more widely transmitted. Fahrenheit 451 depicts a future (definitely a not-too-distant one) in which books are illegal and society is forced to take everything as it is, without questioning "why?" The ironic thing about this is that in subsequent printings, this book has been edited, changed around-.... Parts were taken out of it frequently, and it frequently shows up on banned book lists. What does this say about our society? Nothing too great, I'm afraid. Pull yourself away from the meaningless masses, read this book, take it's message to heart, and try to prevent the future depicted in this book from ever coming into fruitition, and maybe we can take a detour from this headlong-forward trainwreck our society is currently apathetically riding on. As Bradbury himself has said, "I'm not interested in predicting the future, I'm interested in PREVENTING it." Let's help him.
