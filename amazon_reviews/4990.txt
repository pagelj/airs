awful
this was a huge waste of money. web browsing was impossible. I bought this for my ten yr old. ten minutes after he turns it on he was done.  not sure if it was defective. amazon sent me a prepaid label and gave me full credit.  I gave my kid my old kindle fire and got myself the HD. win- win for amazon & us.
