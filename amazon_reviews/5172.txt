Overall, I like this vacuum. It fits nicely in my closet with the adjustable handle, and it isn't too heavy. It definitely picks up an amazing amount of hair and dust. The spinning hose attachment is great for cleaning my couch, and it does take care of cat hair pretty well. But there is a downside:I've had this for over a year, and my biggest complaint is the hose attachment. As you can see in the picture, the hose arches over in front of the handle. You are given a gray plastic "tray" with small tabs at the ends to insert into the sides of the vacuum cleaner. This tray doesn't like to stay in place, and after about 8 months or so of struggling with it, it finally just broke off of my vacuum completely. Good riddance, IMO. The hose still sits over the top just fine... I should have taken it off sooner. There is also a little tube towards the bottom of the vacuum for you to put the end of the hose when you aren't using it. This also does not keep things where they are supposed to be. The hose pops out constantly and flops around as I'm vacuuming. Not a huge deal, the vacuum still functions, it's just massively irritating and you probably don't want the hose potentially banging around on your furniture while you are trying to vacuum the carpets. I don't bother keeping the attachments on the vacuum either-they stay in my closet until I want to use them. I guess what sums this up is that the inside of the vacuum works great. The outside attachments, however, are cranky, but I still think it's a great deal considering the price and size.
