Loved this story!
This was a very well written romance novel. Strong characters, the perfect amount of angst between the two major characters. Great plot that is cleverly written and filled with wonderous detail and action around every corner, with just enough love and passion intertwined. I love romance stories in which you practically shout "whooo hooo" when the two characters come together. Definite must read. I have read a couple historic romances with some sea and ship portions to the plot, but this was nearly 100% at sea and full of adventure and charm. I don't know anything about sailing, but it seems the author had a magnificent grasp of the innerworkings of a ship and its crew. Check it out! A real page turner.
