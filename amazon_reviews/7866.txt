Horrible!
I have always had hp products and don't know who or what is to blame for this machine.. hp or Microsoft 8 or the vendor that sold it... nothing but trouble from the minute I turned it on.. I believe it came to me with some sort of virus on it and when I have time I will take it to a computer analyst for evaluation.  Did not like windows 8.. sometimes too much glitz is just that!
