A decent supplemental camera case
I've seen better designed cases but for $10. I don't think it can be beat.  I'd prefer a top opening rather than having to click the flap and then access your camera.  By the time your camera is out of the case--the perfect shot could be gone.  Again, for the money--you'd have to go pretty far to find a better deal.
