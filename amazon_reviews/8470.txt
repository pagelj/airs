Not Worth The Money
I bought this phone in December 2012.  If I had written a review at that time I would've given it 5 stars.  It worked great for about the first 3 months.  Then the alarm stopped working periodically.  I did some research and found it this is a common issue with this phone and even downloading other alarm apps won't fix the problem.  The phone seems to be getting slower everyday.  I knew this wasn't the fastest phone but I only use it for texting, occasional calls, and periodic web browsing and even texting alone can slow the phone down.  Turning on the GPS and 3G at the same time is the worst.  The only Pro about this is the battery life.  It averages about 2-3 days per charge (again, mainly used for texting) and the most I've gotten is about 4 1/2 days which is pretty good but it's still a slow phone.  Would not recommend purchasing if wanting to use for more than a few months.
