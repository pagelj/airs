Starts like gangbusters
The beginning of this novel starts like gangbusters, full of tension and action. I was beginning to despair that there wouldn't be a story because the intial pursuit scene just kept going, and going, and going, but it eventually developed into an interesting twist on a first contact novel. Not one of my top picks of the year, but it kept me reading to the end.
