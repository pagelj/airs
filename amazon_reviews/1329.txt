Broke after one week
We bought this DVD player for our little daughter to use on our trip overseas. We brought all her favorite DVDs and all of them were working fine for the first week. After that DVD started locking up and would not play on start or when you push play, numerous restarts sometimes fixed the problem. Then some of the DVDs started showing "incompatible disk" that didn't make sense, since all of the disks we had were working before. Later on most of the disks started showing the same message upon loading. Now we are down to one disk that still plays but after 10 minutes it turns off and you have to restart it again. We tried loading the DVDs into another DVD player and they worked fine. We have long flight back home and this is going to be a challenge to keep restarting this DVD player just to make it play for 10 minutes at the time. I will be returning it upon my return.
