Convenient Accessory for Canon Models
The Canon RC-6 Wireless Remote is a small, useful tool when working to minimize camera shake. Its one-button design is simplicity itself. The only inconvenience I've encountered in using the product is the limited angle of operation. You must be in front of the camera to trigger it with the device. When shooting ultra-wide scenes this can be a problem. I would strongly recommend attaching its tiny case to your camera strap to avoid losing it!
