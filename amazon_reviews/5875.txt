I just tried out the Eureka on the stairs and am very pleased with it's performance.  I finally got sick and tired of lugging our big upright up and down and decided to try this.  I knew I wanted one with a cord so it would have stronger suction and wow, this works great.  Using a cordless might be okay, but this one with the brush really picks the stuff up.
