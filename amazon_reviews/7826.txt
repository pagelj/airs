Great for the 3 months it worked!!!!
We originally purchased the DVP970 swivel screen model to take on vacation this past Summer, we had it for about 3 months, but unfortunately mid vacation the screen seemed to crack internally.  I assumed my daughter dropped it and that's why it had cracked (but i didn't know how because we had attached it to a hardcover case to protect it), so my husband brought us this model DVP980.  Same functions pretty much as the other model except of course no swivel screen.  I will say that the overall design is great for kids, i loved the hold button so my daughter couldn't press any buttons while she watched, the sound is great, and the picture quality is also great. BUT and this is a BIG BUT, it only lasts 3 MONTHS!!!! The same thing that happened to the first one happened to this one.  I turned it on one day and to my SURPRISE a HUGE crack through the screen.  I KNOW this one was not dropped, and now i think that the first one was NEVER dropped either.  There MUST be a MAJOR flaw with the screens!! I called customer service since it says it has a one year warranty - after being on hold on and off for an hour the man finally came back and said it would cost me 39.99 to get it fixed plus my shipping to them, so about 50! REALLY! I was so mad! These players are NOT CHEAP and i had already purchased 2 within 6 months and now i had to pay another 50? I will not buy a SONY anymore.  I thought it was worth it to spend the money when i originally purchased it, thinking it's a SONY and it will last her atleast a year, WRONG! Don't buy it unless you want to buy another one 3 months later!
