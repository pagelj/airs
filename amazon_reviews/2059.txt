Great bag, great price
Fits an FZ150 like a glove. The bag is just deep enough that the lens hood can be set in the bottom of the bag and the camera just fits above on its side, this is the way I carry my camera. The FZ150 will also fit lens down with the hood on (ready to shoot position, not inverted) but has marginally enough room on top to accommodate the shoulder strap. The side pockets are fine for a small cleaning cloth, rain cover or extra battery and the pockets provide additional side padding for your camera if nothing else.  The bag has a belt strap on the back, a carrying handle on top and a decently long shoulder strap. The inner pocket is fine for an SD card and the divided space for a filter. Overall the bag is well designed, reasonably sturdy and an incredible bargain for 10 bucks! edit Ooops. now $15 bucks, don't you hate when that happens!
