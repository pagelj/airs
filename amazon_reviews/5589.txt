War and Loneliness
The Forever War is a great novel by Haldeman that touches on loneliness and war. This book obviously draws parallels with the Vietnam War, however I tried to approach this more as a sci-fi novel rather then a Vietnam War turned space-opera. In this book you are Mandella, a man drafted into war. Nothing about this is safe, not even the training missions. You are at war with Taurens, you are out for revenge, well somebody is anyways. You travel through space using 'collapsars' which are like worm-holes that allow you to travel through space, hundreds of lightyears, in an instant. The problem here is that as you travel through these you age much slower, so you may have only been gone for a couple months but perhaps Earth has aged dozens of years. You work your way up the ranks not because you're a great soldier, more because you just happen to survive. The Forever War is mostly good. Rarely did I find myself bored - it seems as though something interesting happens on just about every page. The problem is that Haldeman didn't explore some of the most interesting aspects as much as I would have liked, especially the aging issue. Sure, it's discussed, but not enough to really affect the reader. Also, there is a lot of pot use and such which just didn't seem very fitting. I have nothing against marijuana (far from it), it just seems really out of place - it almost feels forced, like the author included it only to appeal to the kids of the 70s (which is when this book was written). Character development is a bit spotty too. I feel that this book could have been fleshed out a little bit more, then maybe it would have had even more of an impact on me. So this book isn't absolutely perfect, but it is still a very engaging read that I highly recommend. If you are looking for a sci-fi page-turner that keeps you interested from the first page to the last then pick this up!
