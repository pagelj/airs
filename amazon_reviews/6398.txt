Best Kind of Deal there is!
First off, I must state that I am a very careful and particular shopper. I like nice, expensive things, but more importantly I like quality. I have owned several Hamilton beach products before, and as far as performance, they have always met my expectations. But, they aren't always pretty to look at... this toaster is. I was going to buy the Breville, which looks great, but is nearly $200. This is the only toaster under $80 that has a complete stainless steel body. It really looks good. Its almost a cross between those old quality products from the 50's and modern kitchen appliances. Furthermore, as usual the product performs as expected, or in this case quite a bit better. All functions work as described, all four coils light up, and the temperature is accurate enough. The timer bell is loud, but the timer itself is not... thank goodness. This product is simply the result of good engineering and a good sense of style. Amazing price... but i would still pay double if it was made in America, or if at least Chinese workers didn't have to suffer like slaves..
