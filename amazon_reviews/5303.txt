Good but...
The screen is huge... so huge that it did not fit my 1996 GMC Jimmy. Due to the design of the Jimmy Truck the radio does not fit without cutting or altering the Truck's Dash.. The Trucks gear shift (steering column) prevented proper installation. I like the radio but it just didnt fit my truck's dash
