Little bubbles underneath
I am sorry to say that I am not pleased with the looks after application. The protectors do not fit on the Samsung SII for Straighttalk so I had to cut it a little. That's not so bad, but after applying there are little bubbles underneath and I cannot get them out. I cleaned everything very thoroughly and it did not help. I understand that they are very inexpensive but they still should do better than that. It is not the sellers fault. It's just the product.
