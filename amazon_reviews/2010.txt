Very good lens
I like having a lens with such a wide aperture for low light situations.  One drawback is the fact that, when used with a less than full frame sensor, the photo is a fraction of what would be captured by a full frame sensor.  For my camera, the crop factor is 1.6, which makes using this lens more like having an 80 mm lens.  This requires being further from the subject to capture larger groups of people.
