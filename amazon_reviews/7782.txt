Obviously the most durable and well-built phone mount i've used, but.....
The holder just doesn't stay in place with my detachable face car CD player.  It falls forward and pulls the detachable face with it.  I'm disappointed because this is obviously built with strength and durability in mind. My review is only a word of warning to those with detachable face car stereos.  Everyone else should love this mount.
