I ordered this coffeemaker on March 31, 2011.  I received the maker on approximately April 6, 2011.  I really liked it while it worked; however, it just quit working on August 1, 2011.  They just don't make coffeemakers that last any more - very frustrating!! IMPORTANT UPDATE FOR REVIEW:  I was able to get a replacement coffeemaker after taking the original one to an authorized dealer.  I later found out that I was getting electrical surges in my home, due to the location of my home being at the end of a circuit.  After having an electrician install a surge protector in the breaker box, I have had no more problems.  (Found this out when all my smoke alarms (12 of them) suddenly started malfunctioning!!)--- WAS NOT A BAD COFFEEMAKER, AFTER ALL!!
