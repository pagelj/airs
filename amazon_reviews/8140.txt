Disc player and internet access - cool
Plays all sorts of discs, and has internet access too. We can watch our Netflix streaming movies without hooking up an iPad or laptop to the TV. Offers surfing, etc.  Makes things easier in many ways. The onscreen user interface looks good, but could use some improvements in the 'user experience'. The browser is not Safari or IE, so needs learning. Logging in on the web and keying in user ids and passwords with the onscreen keyboard and remote arrow key requires patience. Of course the remote control is the standard array of buttons arranged by an engineer, not by a user. But overall, I'm willing to learn another e-device to use this product.
