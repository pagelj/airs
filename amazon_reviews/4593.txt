good value for the money
Does what it should, excellent picture quality and a simple user interface. It has a fan that makes sound you will hear when room is quiet. It has a cheesy box with a quirky rounded right corner, and the unfinished bottom will show you it's silver underpants if it is mounted anywhere near eye level. (do you slouch on your couch?)But if you have not bought a player in a couple of years, you will be delighted with improvements in picture quality,interface graphics,and speedy load.
