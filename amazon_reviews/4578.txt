Beware of LCD light not lasting long
Purchased my Breville oven from William Sonoma.  Love all the features it provides including the convention feature.  At the time the oven was selling for $400 purchased it on sale for $349 believing I was making a great investment.  After about 3 years of use the LCD light no longer works and as a result it is very difficult to make the selection I need.  It is especially hard for my parents to use now without the light. Sometimes I think I have it on the right selection and my food burns because I don't. Had I known the LCD light would have only lasted around 3 years I would have never purchased this unit.  Very dissapointed........
