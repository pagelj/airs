Does what it says
This is an economical and environmentally sound mount for your tv. I liked that it hand less metal and packaging than the competitor. The only problem I had was that there were not enough spacers because my LED tv as so thin. It seems like the mount would fit other models that are thicker LCD, plasma, etc, but the LED was too small. He. I called customer service they told me it was a new model so they did not have any parts to send out. I had to go to the hardware store to find and appropriate space for the job. So probably all the environmental offset from the mount was burned up in the travel to get this resolved.
