Awesome Grill
This grill is very versatile and great! The removable, dishwasher safe plates make cleaning so easy. The bottom seems to brown a bit faster than the top, but food still cooks through. Also, great as a flat griddle. Due to the flat surface grease and marinades rarely run into the drip tray.
