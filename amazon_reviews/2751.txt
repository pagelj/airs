S-Video Input???
In addition to being able to output audio/video from both the DVD and VCR via HDMI, I decided on this particular DVD/VHS recorder because it had an S-Video input. I needed something that I could connect to the S-Video output from my cable box (in an effort to avoid paying the extra cost of getting a recorder with a built-in tuner). Well, it didn't work! I could record audio, but not video... which sort of defeats the purpose!! I can't say for sure whether this particular unit was defective, but after a couple of hours of trying to get it to work, I gave up. It worked perfectly via the RCA-video input, but not the S-Video input. I tried a couple of different S-Video cables, and I also reread the entire user manual looking for possible answers to what might be causing the problem. I found one small "warning" about using S-Video, but unfortunately it's actual meaning was totally vague at best. I can't imagine why they would put a video input on a unit that wasn't actually intended to be used for recording, but who knows! Likewise, I can't image that my cable box would have an video output that wasn't intended for outputting video, but again... who knows! At any rate, I ended up returning it. I bought it from Vann's (via Amazon. com), and I MUST say that Vann's customer service was nothing short of excellent! After calling them and explaining the problem, they sent me an e-mail (within five minutes) that included a link to print out a UPS return label. I have absolutely no complaints about Vann's whatsoever, and I will happily order from them again. In summary, I can't say for sure exactly which component might have caused the problem, but if you're considering buying this DVD/VHS recorder for connecting via S-Video to your cable box, you might want to contact Toshiba and your cable company first.
