yay!
This game is very adictive. the down side is it's a facebook like game. which means alot of things need to be paid for. but there is a way to get around that part and still get the mane 6. choose how you spend things carefully. but it is a very adictive game. i just got fluttershy! she is soooooo cute! and i didnt spend a dime! the animation is great and you get to play and interact with them! so keep calm and flutter on. BROHOOVE!
