Nice first effort.
Entertaining story with minimal character development but still engaging. I want to read more about these two main characters and the future they are going to see, if they survive. Even for the military, they use the f-word too often, but I am glad there is no graphic description of sex, though we know it is happening. Heinlein had a lot of sex in his later books, but it only got weird when he got graphic. Kloos will get better at dialog with practice, and the Army part ran pretty well, and only slowed some towards the end of the Navy battle.
