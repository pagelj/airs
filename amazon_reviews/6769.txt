Don't waste your money on this bag!
I thought this bag was cute and I asked for it for Christmas. Once I got it I was happy with how it looked, but not even a week after using it the bag started to rip! It ripped on the handles with little weight in the bag and I tried using the other straps instead but those started to rip as well. Do no waste your money on this bag, spend the 30 dollars you would have spend on this bag and invest it in another one that will actually last longer than a week..
