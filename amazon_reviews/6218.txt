It's like I have a new phone!
First off, yes, you will need to consult a youtube video to get this done.  No, it is not difficult.  Getting the screen off was the biggest challenge as the tool that was provided did not do the trick.  I grabbed a steak knife and was able to gently pry the screen off.  After I got it working I ran out and bought and Otterbox for it.  Quite happy with this.
