Worst phone ever...
From the moment I turned it on this phone has been nothing but problems. It freezes a million times a day, it's ridiculously slow, and it restarts all of the time. It's a hassle just to make a call or send a text too. I've only had it for about 2 months and I hate this phone period. I did a little research and found out that these are known issues and t-mobile continues to sell it. DO NOT BUY IT!!! I'm just going to sell mine and go back to my optimus.
