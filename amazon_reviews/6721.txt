rock solid case
This is my first iphone, so I wanted a good protective case to guard my investment. Not only does this case keep my iphone safe from nicks and scratches it makes it a whole lot easier to hold. It has a great screen protector that does not hinder the abilities of the touch screen. The otterbox has molded in buttons for the on/off switch and volume buttons and these work flawlessly. It also has what I call the "door" on the bottom for access to the charging port. This opens easily with your thumbnail and it closes tightly,and it's definitely not flimsy. The whole case has a rock solid feel to it. I do feel my Iphone is safe in this case, and its surely worth the money spent.
