Good Product For The Price
I bought this item some weeks ago and It's been working Good.. Maybe the issue of Activation could be a problem for you, but I Have the solution. Do the next... Press  ##000000 and then press ok, then, where say MOBIL DIRECTORY NUMBER delete the number that appears in there and Write your own number, then press RIM buttom and press Save.. That's it.. Problem Fixed.. I hope it works on your cellphones...
