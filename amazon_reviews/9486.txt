Perfect!
This HDMI cable is very sturdy and it does the job. I got it to hook our PS3 to the TV after the original cable to it stopped working and I did not have an available HDMI cable. The difference between the original regular cable and this HDMI cable is outstanding! The picture is so sharp and the colors are vibrant! If I knew how great the picture would be, I would have ordered it much sooner instead of wait for the PS3 cable to go out. Yes, HDMI is supposed to be much sharper, but when you find a cable as reasonably priced as this one, you have your doubts. All I have to say is, from someone as detail oriented as I am, I completely approve. It comes well packaged and protected, it is long enough to reach wherever you need and it is thick and sturdy. I cannot recommend it enough!
