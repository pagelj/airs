not overly thrilled
Not a tech person. Don't know the in and outs of tech, but I can use pcs/laptops for what I need them for and have been for last 10+ years. This is my second laptop and I'm not too thrilled with it. Hate windows 8, just on that alone shouldn't have got this. Then there is the keyboard and track pad, both of which I personally can't stand. The performance side of it I do like. Probably gift this to my son and family and just keep using the windows 7 laptop that still works fine if not better then this one.
