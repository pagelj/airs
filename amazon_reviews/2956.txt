Not the best but it is commercial
When I got the paracord i was happy but when i started to wrap my ka bar next gen it started to unravel but when you wrap it together its strong pretty good for light duty stuff but for life threatening situations or life or death situations i wouldnt trust my life to it good for light duty stuff and for backup if necessary rate it 5 stars
