Fire HD as mobile device
I have no other mobile device, no tablet, no iPhone, no laptop.  I have no desire to have continuous connection to the world through the internet or IMs, etc.  The desk top PC is sufficient for me. I have the Kindle DX which I was happier with that I believed I would be but that should not have been a surprise as I am a voracious reader.  No longer had to make weekly trips to the book stores.  But, after 2 years, realized I need a low light reader since I might end up in a shopping mall in a fairly dark coffee shop. A friend talked me into the Fire HD saying if I was going to get another Kindle anyway, get something that offered all these other options in case you ever want them.  I have a wireless router so I thought I would give the HD a try.  I am glad I did.  I fairly often spend the night away from home and the HD gives me both worlds to the extent that I want.  I have my books that I can read anywhere in any lighting condition.  I can connect to the internet and get enough news to satisfy me and then handle important emails.  And I added a few games and apps that I use at home and away. The HD has given me that little more flexibility at home and on the road that I didn't know I was actually looking for.
