Wonderful lens provides sharp images
Before purchasing this lens, I only had a kit lens and telephoto.  I asked my photography teacher which lens I should invest in next. Without hesitation he recommended the nifty fifty (50mm).  This lens was relatively affordable and well worth the money I paid.  Since I've purchased this lens, it's nearly all I use.  My  images are very sharp/ crisp.  I've shot landscapes, portraits and still life with this lens (very versatile).
