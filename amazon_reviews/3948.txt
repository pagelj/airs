Fails to cook toast evenly
I bought this because our 22 year old toaster oven wasn't cooking toast evenly anymore.  I was very disappointed to see this toaster be much worse than the old Black and Decker dinosaur to the point of being unusable.  The toast was black at the top and white at the bottom - regardless of settings.  I should have paid attention to the prior reviews :(I chose this toaster because I'm a gadget freak and it looks really cool, but I returned it after only a few tries (wasting bread). I just ordered the new Black & Decker ST9999 Infrawave 2 Slice Black Toaster.  It has only 2 reviews so far, but it sounds promising.  I will also review that - good or bad - when I get it.
