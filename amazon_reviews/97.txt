You get what you pay for
I bought this monitor because it was the cheapest video monitor available and a top selling product on Amazon.  Well you get what you pay for.  The battery life is terrible.  It only last a few hours unplugged.  This is probably because the screen never can be shut off and also because the VOX (system to silence the receiver when there is no noise) does not work consistently.  So you constantly see the screen on and constantly hear a buzzing noise.  In addition, the audio quality is terrible.  The Summer Night and Day monitor, that I had before and lasted three years before breaking, was a far superior product, but at a much higher price.
