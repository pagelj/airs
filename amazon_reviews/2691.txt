A quality laptop carrier, but not a briefcase
I wanted a sturdy and inexpensive case for a 14" laptop, and this attache does the job well. It's well-constructed and light, and its several zippered pockets hold flat materials well and keep them handy. I was able to squeeze a Logitech 910001780 M305 Wireless Optical Mouse into the primary side pocket, which has 3 compartments that can hold pens and things the size of smartphones. There's hardly any room for anything besides the laptop in the main compartment, though - the laptop's power cord just barely fits above the machine.
