Defective, and caused problems, eventually damaging my tv
I really enjoyed using thing for about a week playing region 2 movies, but I can see that there is a problem using this with a hdmi cable and a television, and what happened is that the remote became unable to power up the dvd player eventually, but who can fault a seller for the cheap shoddy chinese made garbage we all have to put up with these days.  Seems the main problem that started its' damage was that if I paused it to go for a cup of coffee in the kitchen or use the bathroom, the unit would generally power off if it was too much time past a couple minutes, and power off my television as well somehow or caused my tv to shut off, and I don't like that intrusive feature if that was made to do that, apart from hdmi automatically turning to the hdmi port channel on the tv, this is where it started getting worse and worse problem getting it to power back on and the television too.  Eventually over the last week since I started using it, it suddenly stopped allowing the remote to turn the unit on, even with new batteries, so I decided to return it, I believe I might get all of it reimbursed since the logo of "free shipping on all orders over $25" was used. THEN A PROBLEM CROPPED UP ON MY SYLVANIA 32" tv today, a tv that has worked flawlessly with my blue ray player for instance for a year now, that is a little over a year old, thankfully with a three year service plan I had purchased locally like the tv, even though I was a little skeptical of getting service plans but good thing I did, that the tv suddenly wouldn't operate on the hdmi port I had been using, then suddenly the tv went blank, dead finito, it seems the power supply burned out and started sparking at the plug when I tried to unplug and replug along with a high pitched whistle noise, and hey, why wouldn't it, with the philips dvd player shutting it off all the time, where my panasonic dvd and blue ray players don't shut off a tv, its a feature panasonic doesn't include.  Who knows if the tv was weak, but I do suspect that the philips burned it out shutting it off all the time even for just a five minute pause.  Good thing, my tv will get replaced or fixed, bad thing is it will take 8-10 days or more and I have to use an old twelve year tv, and I had to order me a panasonic upconverting all region player. Maybe the real problem is how they have hdmi player devices, dvd and blue ray alike, start operating the tv power options, its a stupid thing, if I want to pause a dvd movie for thirty minutes, even an hour if I have something come up, that's my choice, it happens, and besides, my panasonic products don't like to go to the last place viewed if I stop or turn it off.  If I could afford yet another new tv I would get another hdtv spare, likely a panasonic something or another to be for sure compatible, but I just spent like amount of cash on scores of classic movies, especially region 2 horror movies for the halloween season, this dvd player to play region 2 rare movies, can't really spend another $500, for a spare tv, right now, I'll just have to wait and enjoy my hundreds of dollars of new movies later this month, if I'm lucky. I suppose that if my tv hadn't had 3 hdmi ports, but only two, I would have likely used component connection for movies since my blue ray and digital satellite already used the other two ports, and the dvd player couldn't have been powering down my tv thus busting it, maybe folks ought to consider the same if they feel like they need this dvd player but are unsure of the risk of tv damage with a hdmi cable and this unit playing with the tv power options, word to the wise, I wished this would have worked for me cause one too many panasonic products use the same remote control codes which there are only three to choose from.  I aint pushing panasonic products cause I feel they are the best brand since electronics were invented, its just that they have a reputation for not including too many extra features and make things simpler, maybe why I have a ten year old panasonic dvd player that has thousands of hours on it but will not play the dvd-r movies on demand I've purchased.
