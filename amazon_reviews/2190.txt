GREAT PRODUCT
I felt so silly, but when I tried to connect the DO cable, I had no idea I had to remove the clear protective plastic tubes on the tip of the wires. So at first I THOUGHT THE do CABLE WAS DEFECTIVE BUT UPON FURTHER RESEARCH I stubled across instructions telling to remove the tubes and now the work. Sound is great, crispy and clear. Thanks Amazon
