well... it might have been nice... if it ever worked...
Bought this camera for a trip to belize with my boyfriend and his family. Took it out one time, and it then stopped working. The screen turned black, and there was water inside. I've heard that panosonic has a terrible return policy or warranty thing.... LUCKILY we bought this camera from COSTCO and they gave us a full refund with no questions asked. If your going to buy this camera at least buy it from there so you can get your money back if it breaks!!
