Okay... so I made a decision to never write a review unless my response to the product was "Extreme" on either side of the spectrum... If you'll notice from my other reviews I feel strongly about the product I review whether it is positive or negative. I am a single 56 year old man who does his own cooking,cleaning,shopping and maintenance as much as I can. So I'm always on the lookout for products that make my life easier and are effective in their time saving claims. This product not only failed miserably to cut the mustard it made me feel like a fool for ordering it. It is worthless.  Heavy as hell.  Cumbersome as a cucumber bicycle.  Frustrating as a guitar with no strings.  Simply put, it doesn't work! I purchased this on the Home Shopping Network for over $200 and here it is for half that, Hint, Hint. People are catching up to the lies. Yes, as you can probably tell, I am upset. Sorry, I'm Bi-polar.  Very difficult for me to 'hide' feelings... I shall never bleed to death by biting my lip.  I have used this machine a total of 3 times... will not use it anymore. It really is just a  piece of worthless garbage.  Sorry. I call 'em as I sees 'em.
