I received my new B60 today, thanks to Keurig. Our first one, a Christmas gift, proved defective after 12 cups of coffee. After turning the machine on, the pump primes which you can hear but then after 5 mins., it shuts off and "Not Ready" is displayed on the LCD. After several attempts of shutting the power off then on and unplugging, the B60 was still dead.  John from Keurig tech support was most helpful over the phone but we could not revive the poor B60. The biggest internet retailer (named after a river in So. America) has ceased selling these due to this widespread defect. I hope our new one lasts past the one year warranty. Thumbs up to Keurig customer service! Thumbs down to shoddy build quality and defective parts.
