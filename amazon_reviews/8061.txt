Works with APPLE Photobooth!
Great little camera for the price.  Works at full resolution on Photobooth, the default app that comes with your MAC!  My kids are able to see high resolution images of bugs, the stuff they are not cleaning off their teeth (that was worth the price right there in dental bills saved!)We are going to try it with iMovie to see if we can make magnified movies, I imagine it will work fine, as the camera is identified as a USB 2.0 camera, will work with all default apps.  No drivers to install, no nothing. Got to love Apple.
