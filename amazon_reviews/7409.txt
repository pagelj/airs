Dell Inspiron i17R-1316sLV 17-Inch Laptop
Amazon was great to purchase from. The Inspiron is good except the Windows 8. I hate it. It is far from user friendly. Had to purchase a download for Windows Office ( Another $100.00). The Office is web based.  There is no Picture viewer as in XP. If I had Windows XP I would be truly happy.
