Amazing
Nothing fits in my Saab. Saabs are just odd, funky and awesome but the majority of the time, nothing "standard" fits in my car. This one did and it's pretty cool. I do have to tighten the knob that controls the movement of the panel that holds my phone (iPhone 5) but hey, it makes good use of my cd player. Who uses CDs nowadays anyway?
