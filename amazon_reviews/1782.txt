Lever now won't stay down... after 4 toast cycles...
I don't think I broke the darn thing, but after 4 toast cycles.. in like 5 days now... the lever will no longer keep the toast down, and the button LEDs no longer light.  Only way to get toast is to hold the lever down and stand there.  Only good thing I guess, is that the chances of burning toast are now kept to a minimum... a problem some other reviewers seem to have :-  Plus, I threw out all the packaging, so no returning to store it looks like.
