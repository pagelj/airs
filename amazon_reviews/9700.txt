Good value
I read several reviews before I purchased this and saw that others had trouble with the monitor dying, but the price was right so I decided to take a chance. I've noticed that on occasion the monitor wouldn't charge, and I had to reset the battery. Once it was in properly, no more charging problems. Last week the camera stopped working (have used it for 6 months), just called the company directly since the return period is over. They are sending a replacement, initially quoted me a week to receive it but once I asked they agreed to send it out via 2 day express delivery. Hopefully this solves my problem, otherwise no complaints.
