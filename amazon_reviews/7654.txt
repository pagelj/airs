What I expected
I bought this product to evaluate its potential use in a school setting. (I am an IT manager.) It meets all of my expectations. I have to admit that there is a learning curve on the user interface, since it differs from my familar PC screen and Microsoft apps. I think students would adapt to this product much quicker than us old PC guys. The product is marketed as a cloud based computing device and it does that function well. I think it's a little pricey, but I'm sure that will change soon. I love the 8 second "boot" time and the fact that has alot useability in a light weight form factor. Good way to get free of expensive Microsoft apps (such as Office) without losing too much funtionality. Battery life is great too.
