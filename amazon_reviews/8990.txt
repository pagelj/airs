Don't use in low light
Took the suggestion of Amazon and bought this filter for the Canon 50mm f1.8 since the price was cheap.  I will never make the mistake of buying a cheap filter again.  Unlike other filters I have, the threads were not very good and had trouble getting the filter on the lens.  When it was on, don't shoot in low light because it will ruin every photo.  I have these green glowing spots on each shot, the internal reflection is not acceptable even on a $75 lens.  Sorry Tiffen, I'm going back to Hoya, haven't had this problem on other lenses with their filters. Next time I will take the advice of amazon but look for better quality items.  Live and learn, at least it was only $10 I am out cause it will be too much work to try and return it.
