Blurry Pictures and Messed Up Colors
I bought this camera to take pictures of my daughter. I went outsife to try it out on some plants. My azeleas looked nothing like the colors that were being displayed on the camera. The camera made them washed out. So I tried taking more pictures closer to sunset. Those pics looked great on the LCD screen. When I got to my computer, all of the pictures were blurry. I had used several shooting modes. This was a huge dissapointment, so I instantly returned the camera. My advice: go with a different camera.
