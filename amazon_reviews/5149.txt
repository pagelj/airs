A different way of looking at the world
I never really enjoyed science fiction, but something about this book caught my eye. The story revolves around one lone fireman, Guy Montag, who, oddly enough, sets fire to books instead of putting them out. He lives in a world that doesn't like to see unhappiness and the real truth, so they destroy books and all that causes unhappiness. When he meets a girl who, unlike all of the others, "thinks," not only about life and the deeper meaning behind the events which happen in our daily lives, which we don't acknowledge because we are all so busy, he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind those books and behind life. Along the way, he meets Faber, the elderly man who guides him on his journey. There is a certain tragedy in this book, and although the events in this book don't happen in life verbatim, it is remarkably similar to events which happen in everyday life. This appeared to have been a spiritual experience, not only for the characters, but for the author Ray Bradley. The characters are so tortured inside, caught between what they are expected to do and what they know is right. This book made me think more about what life really is about. And, as demonstrated in this book so many times, you never know when your life is going to end, so as it says in the book: "Stuff your eyes with wonder. Live as if you'd drop dead in 10 seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day, every day, sleeping its life away."
