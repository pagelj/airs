Perfect but sparkley
These screen protectors are perfect. Very easy to apply and hardly noticable. The only slight downside is that the diamond version looks a bit sparkley, which you can't see from the picture. It's rarely noticable though unless you're paying attention to it, so its not a bother to me at all. They protect my screen well against scratches and last a long time. Also great price and fast shipping. Overall extremely satified and will definitely buy again.
