Love it!
I love that this camera can fit in my pocket so I can have it ready to shoot a picture whenever I see something that I like.  The photo is really clear.  After a little testing, I was able to figure out how to find the best setting.  It took a couple of times to download the software to my computer.  It is made special for those with a Playstation and since I do not have a Playstation I had to figure out how to download just what is needed for my computer.  I recommend this camera.
