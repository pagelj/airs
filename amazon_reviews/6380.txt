Wow, how thought that a toaster would make me feel so good, so important, so worldly... its just a TOASTER, or is it? I did go a little to far, and put it in the living room with a small spotlight on it to bring it to center of conversation, my wife was a bit upset until I started making toast with a small spread of the highest quality peanut butter to pass out to our pompous, and prominent guests... Yes, I did cut off the crust, as I was out to fully impress. The only thing that bothers me is the exquisite matte finish, it leave no finger prints, so when it keeps getting moved back into the kitchen, I know who it is, but I have no proof, because the toaster is finger print proof... Horatio Cain, I need you and your team, don't worry about lunch, I have that covered. See you on America's Top Toast Maker coming to a network near you.
