Nice little phone
Bought this for a second cell phone. For the price this is a fantastic deal. But it is not my android smart phone by any  means. It gets a great signal every where I go. The features are simple and easy to use, and does everything you need it to do for basic everyday use. Works great as a second cell phone and doesn't cost much per month. Thanks Amazon for another great deal and product.
