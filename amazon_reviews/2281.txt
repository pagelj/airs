Great toy!
We purchased this blue camera for my 4 year old son, and a pink one for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas. They have spent the previous three days happily snapping away. I highly recommend it. Pros:-Very easy controls. My 4 year old had no problem grasping the concept of the zoom feature, how to move back and forth through the picture preview (which they love), how to use the view finder, and how to turn it off and on.-Auto-off for when they don't turn it off themselves.-The way the camera is designed to be held lessens the likelihood of photographed fingers.-Easy-open packaging. YEA!-Easy-open, yet secure, battery compartment. YEA!-Tough. My son's camera has already been dropped down our wood stairs, and stepped on. My daughter's was left out in a heavy, day-long rain. We dried it off, inside and out. The stored pictures remained view-able, and it still takes new pictures. For now. ( ^_^ )-Uses a standard USB cord to transfer photos to a computer. (Not included.)-A free, associated website is available to add borders, and enhancements to pictures. Easy enough for the kids to do a lot of the work themselves. Cons:-Picture quality, particularly in lower light levels, is poor. An auto-flash feature would be nice.-The camera must be held very still to avoid blurry pictures. Hard for little ones to do. However, my kids couldn't care less. Taking the pictures is all the fun. I have been able to easily clean the pictures up a bit in Picassa. As you can see, I feel the pros really outweigh the cons. This is a great introduction to cameras and picture taking for small children!
