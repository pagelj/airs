Great product!
My husband and I bought this TV for our bedroom. We have a 46 inch Samsung in our living room, and wanted to purchase the same product just smaller.  This TV has a great picture and is the perfect size for a bedroom.  I would recommend this product.  A red light stays on when the TV is off letting you know it is powered off, but there is no way to turn it off.  I did some research hoping to find a way to turn it off, but it is a feature that cannot be turned off.  I would purchase this product again.
