Great book for someone 30 to 45
This book is aimed squarely at those who grew up in the 80s --- hooray for us!  I enjoyed the book greatly on its own merits and because of my demographic.  I cannot see anyone over 45 getting the book (it would be like reading Gunther Grass with no knowledge of European history, and for those under 30 they may enjoy and understand the technology angle well enough but few of the references (if Skolnick doesn't have a nerdy resonance with you, don't bother).
