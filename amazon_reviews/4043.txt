This espresso maker is easy to use and makes a great latte. It does take a little time to fine tune things to your liking, but once you've got it "wired" it produces consistent results.  You do need to fill the carafe further than the 2 cup line, 1/2 way between or almost to the 4 cup line, to produce enough steam to get your milk good and hot and frothed correctly. That leads me to the only thing I don't like about this machine, it is really a 1 latte at a time machine. Otherwise you can't get enough water in it to produce 4 (shots) of espresso and get good steam into your milk.  If your just using it for yourself it is well worth the money.
