Terrible RMA/Warranty service
I bought this card in February, and in early August the card died on me. After navigating Transcend's very poorly designed website for hours, I finally found their warranty page. I sent the card in, and because I very carefully sliced half the card's sticker off (because the top half was peeling off and I didn't want to lose the entire sticker) the warranty was rejected. This is, of course, after I'd received an e-mail from Transcend's RMA department saying they were sending my card back and that everything had been processed (but neglecting to mention the part where my RMA request had been rejected). The card itself was fantastic for as long as it was alive. Transcend's warranty policies, however, have lost them a customer permanently.
