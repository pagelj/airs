Solid toy keeps 1 year old entertained on the road
I take my little girl to daycare each day - 30 minutes one way.  I put all kinds of toys in her lap to keep her entertained.  She seems to like this toy more than most.  I can see what she is doing since I picked up one of those headrest mirrors that let you see your child in a backward facing car seat from your rear view mirror (also from amazon). It's been dropped plenty.  Keeps on ticking, not overly annoying for everyone else (like many toys) and keeps my little girl entertained.
