Missing part
This would be a perfectly decent tiny shoulder bag for a tiny netbook, if it wasn't for one "but": how do you forget to include a part in an item that only has three parts to it? Based on the product description and a multitude of pictures included on the product page (boy, Amazon really sells this one hard!), I expected to receive a netbook case, a shoulder strap, and a shoulder pad to go with it. Well, I did get the bag and the strap. And just so I would be sure that there was no mistake, I got a nice glossy tag attached to the bag with a blown-up picture of a shoulder strap with a pad on it ('cuz it's a selling point) and the statement verifying that yes, the item in the picture was indeed the 10.2" netbook case. So, I am not thrilled, I won't put myself through the added inconvenience of sending it back, I will take the pad off my last bag and transplant it to this one. But I can't recommend this item. Caveat Emptor.
