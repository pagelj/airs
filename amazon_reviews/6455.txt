Pretty great with one flaw
I bought this June 23rd (today is Sept. 9) and I have used it intermittently. I really like it. It makes good smoothies. The blender goblet doubling as a cup is a nice touch, as are the measurements on the side. I hadn't bothered reviewing it before but I think I've seen similar comments on this issue so I wanted to add my voice: like I said, I bought this quite recently and I've used it fewer than 15 times... and a couple smoothies ago the lid developed a crack in the side, right where the sipping opening is. If it were anywhere else it wouldn't be a problem, but since it's exactly where you pour out the smoothie, its dribbling and leaking there means smoothie on my chin! I'll be calling customer service tomorrow and I'll update this review if I get any useful answers.
