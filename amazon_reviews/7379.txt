I bought this coffee maker and a month later it was broken.  The water would not filter through.  I contacted Black and Decker customer service who told me my product was under warranty and could be replaced.  I thought, thats great!  I thought wrong.  First of all, after they told me I was covered under warranty and I submitted the information they requested they dropped off the radar.  I emailed 5 times in 3 weeks with no response!  The last email I sent I requested to be forwarded to a manager.  It seemed as though they were waiting for my warranty period to run out before the responded!!!! When I finally received a response, they told me that I would have to cut the cord off and send it in along with a check for $7.50!!!  Are you kidding me?  I already paid $30 for it and it broke a month later, now you want MORE of my money to replace YOUR faulty product?  NOT A SNOWBALLS CHANCE BLACK AND DECKER!!!! In a world where consumer purchases rely so heavily on customer service, and product reviews I was surprised to find out that not only were they expecting me to pay for the bubble envelope and the extra stamps it would take to send the cord in, but they also want me to pay for the shipping of my replacement!!! Worst customer service ever.  Even if I didnt have to harass and badger the company to death to get them to respond to me after they offered a replacement, expecting me to pay for YOUR product malfunction is unbelievable. I told Black and Decker they just lost a customer for life and got a Mr. Coffee instead.  Couldnt be happier with that choice.
