smoked and melted
the length is great to have--I still want to find another cord. But unfortunately this one I ordered my son was using it with his iPad and pulled it out quickly because he noticed smoke coming from it and when he went to pull it out the rubber coating just smooshed between his fingers.  No injury or mishap thank goodness, just a cord that was used twice and now I can no longer use.
