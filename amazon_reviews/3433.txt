Pay attention to this guy!
He's gonna be the next "most-read author," or at least he should be!  The story line of "Wool" pulled me in enough that I went for #2 in the series and stayed in for the long haul. I'm glad to have been introduced to this writer's work! Howey would be the perfect book club Skype guest.  This material would generate a lively discussion of societal coercion leading to dystopia.  Watch out for Howey, because he's been signed with Random House UK, and he's going to be BIG!  Read the "Wool Omnibus" before Ridley Scott makes the movie.  You'll be so glad you did.
