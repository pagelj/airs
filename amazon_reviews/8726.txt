I was disappointed after spending $90.00 for this coffee machine. Cons: It is cheaply made, no insulation, very loud, and no water filter. Now the thing that makes me most crazy is the screw down cap on the carafe, it is extremely hard to open after you brew the coffee because the heat from the coffee distorts the cap,, making it next to impossible to unscrew to get your first cup of coffee. The cap has a thin edge with small bumps to grip, very bad design.  It slowly gets easier as the coffee looses it heat. Pros: The water comes out at 200 degrees which is a good thing for making a great cup of coffee. The coffee stays hot for a long time like 5hrs.  If you don't mind all the negatives than this is the coffee machine for you.
