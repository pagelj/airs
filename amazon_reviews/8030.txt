I was looking for a vacuum that would switch easily from carpet to hard wood and one that could handle a large amount of pet hair. This vacuum does both wonderfully! You can switch the roller brush off with the push of a button when you want to clean hard floors. It's suction is very powerful and doesn't blow back any dust. I vacuumed my carpets with my old bissel, then used the shark for the first time. I filled my dust cup up full with dog hair! Here's a breakdown of pros and consPros:Light weightLong, transparent hose (so if you did ever get a clog it wouldn't be a guessing game as to where)Long power cord (much longer than my Bissel)Smaller brush head (this may be a con for some people but I love how easily it fits around and under things)Easy canister release and emptyingCan turn roller brush on and offEfficiently cleans wood laminate and tileVery quiet ( I can vacuum the main parts of my house in the mornings without waking anyone up)Cons:The dirt canister is pretty smallThe suction is so strong that if you're not careful it will pull your vacuum over when using attachments. I was dusting my tv with the brush attachment and the vacuum almost fell over on it! I've read that if you do need to get it repaired the customer service is horrible but I have no personal experience with thisI ended up buying my Navigator at Walmart because it was $20 cheaper. While it is the same vacuum, it doesn't come with the extra set of filters. I would have paid the extra $20 to get them because they're almost that much plus shipping and handling on the Shark website. So far this vacuum is everything it says it is, We are a family of six with a dog that sheds constantly and a home daycare. If a vacuum can clean up after all that then it's pretty impressive in my book. If anything changes I will update my review to let you know!
