Dirty item
Product came after 3 weeks of waiting, it looks cool but it came with dirt all over the bottom front of the case. It looks like it had been previously used and carelessly repackaged. I tried to take the dirt off but it wouldn't budge. Didn't expect much with the very low price tag, but they could at least have sent me an unused item. Not recommended.
