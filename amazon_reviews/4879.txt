On my 4th Kindle Fire... Thanks Amazon
I just got off customer support and they are sending me my 4th Kindle Fire. Yes. FOURTHThe first one, the battery flashed empty with a ? on it when it was plugged in and had no power unplugged. The 2nd one wouldn't show a loss of memory when an application was uninstalled so it filled up and I had no way, other than a hard reset, to get my memory back. The third one has a bad battery life, the battery only lasted an hour before it would die. I asked the customer service rep if I could just get a refund or a credit to buy an upgrade in hopes that the issues I am having are just a 1st generation issue. I was told I could get a $20 credit to put towards the purchase of the Kindle Fire HD but I was out past my 30 day refund period. That's ok, Amazon. I will just keep sending these back until I get one that workds. Here's to hoping #4 is a keeper.(and this is #4 in less than a year.)
