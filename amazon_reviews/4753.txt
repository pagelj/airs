Don't even bother
I thought this was a GREAT price but, great prices are only great if the product works. This does not. The cord was fine but the wall plug wasn't. I purchased two of them, one for my daughter and the other for me to use as a spare. My daughter called me later that day when she got home and informed me that a message had come up on here phone screen stating:  "WARNING: This product does not support charging."  Well how about that. You buy a plug to charge your phone and the plug doesn't support charging. It's not worth my time or effort to bother with a return due to the cheap price so I'm going to keep the cords and purchase two new plugs else where. Hope this helps.
