Nice camera, did not meet expectations
Purchased the camera because of the long zoom, electronic viewfinder and many other features that came with it.  The camera did not dissappoint.  The camera is loaded with many feaures that  more expensive cameras do not have.  Unfortunately, I felt like the picture quality was not any better than my 10 year old Nikon which had half the megapixels.  Pictures taken in low light were grainy likewise with the video.  I tried the camera for several days taking pictures with my old camera, then taking the same shot with this new camera and found that the old camera took as good or better pictures.  So I made the decision to the return the camera.  Amazon was great about returning it.
