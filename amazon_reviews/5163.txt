Very cute
I've had my covered for weeks now and I've still only used one and it's in perfect condition! I was tired of my iphone covers breaking where you connect the charger - Glad I finally found one that doesn't break after a few uses. I like how the back is smooth and the front bumper covers enough. Not to mention very good price. Will be ordering more styles of this brand in the future!
