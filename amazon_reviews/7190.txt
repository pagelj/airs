Great step by step
I recently bought one of the super-zoom point and shoot cameras.  While researching, I came across a lot of recommendations for this book, so I bought it.  Definately not a mistake.  This book is exactly what a new photographer needs.  Instead of a bunch of theory, you get real world solutions to various problems you may have getting that great shot. About the only thing that I think could be improved is the layout of the topics.  Since this is so good for a new photographer, I find it strange that one of the first chapters covers wedding photography.  There's not a lot of amateurs that would tackle a wedding.
