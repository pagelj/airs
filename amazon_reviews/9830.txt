There is a few issues
I found 4 things I didn't like about what I received so far...1. when first received found the audio jack cord was defective to the point of making any sound received by the portable stereo to sound horrific and quiet.2. found out the battery door was also defective and did not close all the way and was broken.3. the usb cord I received does not work for transferring information between any two devices and is only meant to recharge the device."I find the company to be a bit cheap about some of the details of the device"4. If the volume is turned up past 5/6 of how far it goes the noise gets distorted."meaning the speakers can't take much stress."I hope they will find solutions for most of my problem and fix them. I will report more on this device at a later time.
