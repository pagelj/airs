Very Tough, Horrible Picture Quality
My wife and I got this camera for a 9-month trip around the world.  We thought we could take this one along on days when we'd be adventuring in the outdoors and didn't want to take along the nice Nikon SLR.  Now that we're 6 months into the trip, I've found we absolutely never take this camera along with us because the pictures are so bad and so worthless, we might as well not even have it.  I will say that it is tough and hasn't given us any problems in the water.  However, every single shot in water and on land is grainy and washed out.  Shots taken indoors look like the people are ghosts in a snowstorm.  We've tried a number of different settings for all kinds of situations and there are a few combinations that produce at best mediocre pictures.  This camera replaced an $80 point-and-shoot from Kmart that we had for many years and that camera took Ansel Adams shots compared with this one.  Honestly, don't buy it.  Unless you want to but it from us....
