Perfect toast and pizza all the time!
I had this for 3 weeks and after using it for one week, immediately I ordered another one for my daughter-in-law.  It might be a bit pricey to use as a toaster but it's worth it for the perfect browning of your toast.  Even the frozen pizza comes out perfect.... my kids fight to operate this little oven.  I have been using toaster oven for my toast since it serves more purposes than a regular toaster but the size and ease of use of this Panasonic Toaster Oven is by far the best.
