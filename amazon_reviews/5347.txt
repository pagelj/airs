Egg sidecar never worked- No company warranty support
Product arrived dysfunctional. Toaster would toast bagel/toast, but the side egg element wouldn't heat (not even a few degrees);  the egg element was lifeless. Contacted Back to Basics' customer support, gave them the sticker number from the bottom of the toaster, and their response was that it was manufactured too long ago for them to honor the warranty.  I have had it altogether now less than four months- tried to return it immediately.  Ordered it December '08, product was manufactured August '06... I will, of course, never buy a product from Back to Basics or its parent company (Focus Electrics) holdings (Back to Basics, West Bend).  I strongly suggest you to do the same.  They hot potato you a shoddy product, sold knowingly without any sort of warranty whatsoever.
