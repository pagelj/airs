Might just be the worst screen protector I've ever seen
If i could give this 0 stars, then I would. Just imagine the worst screen protector ever, and this is it. They have a sticker that tells you to take off  after you install the screen protector that is impossible to get off, and it leaves part of the protector sticky. 'Ive applied many screen protectors before, but it is impossible to get the air bubbles out of this. The reason is because the adhesive is ridiculously sticky. When i tried to remove the protector, it split into 2 layers. Also, it left my screen very sticky. I Do not recommend these.
