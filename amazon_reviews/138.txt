Spy Bag Lover
Love this bag! There are lots of fun hiding places - pouches, etc. There is plenty of room for using my Kangaroo organizer. The material is not leather, but it looks close enough. The only negative is that the handles should be just a little bit longer so that it can be used as a shoulder bag. The handles are really nicely woven so that carrying it in your hand or on your arm, the handles do not cut into your flesh if you have overloaded your 'spy'.
