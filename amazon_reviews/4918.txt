Order got screwed up so this will be a N9770 Review
It's great when you first get the phone master reset it to get the test stuff they punched in out. I have AT&T and it works wonderfully I actually get reception in my basement where my phone never worked also I dont have andriod web plan and this phone works on the regular data plan. SHHHH dont tell at&t that this phone works around thier network blocks. It's extremely fast i think you'll love it. Remeber if you have At&T and you buy the Model 9770 3G turn the android web off save your 50 bucks and just get a regular unlimited data plan. if they ask you if its a smartphone say NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
