We have bought two Mr Coffee machines last year.  The last one was exactly this model, the previous one was essentially the same but with a clock/timer.  Both quit working after 6 months with the same problem - while the power is "on" (that is, the power indicator is on) the heater unit does not work.  I will not buy a Mr Coffee unit again.
