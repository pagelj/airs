I use this vacuum at my preschool (over 3000 square feet) every day.  I've had it for approximately 8 months now, and its been great.  I took the brush out once to clear it of hair, but besides that, its been flawless.  I wish Hoover made a commercial canister vac of the same quality.  I do wish I had a hose/wand. Great buy. It is, however, super loud.  Loudest vac I've ever used.
