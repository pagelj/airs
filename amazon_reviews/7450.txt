A must read for every science fiction fan
This anthology truly shows the evolution of the genre. Lesser known novels from famous authors such as Campbell and Burroughs are quite a treat. Some are great, some not so great, but with such varied selection, you can always skip to the next one! Mihai PrunaAuthor, Blood in the Sandbox
