More than expected
The first time around I by-passed this book thinking "it's been done." I looked thru many others, tried samples then came back to this one and ordered a sample. It was so intriguing that I bought the book. I was pleasantly surprised how the author took these overdone topics, plots, etc. and turned them into a fasinateing read with a good ending too. This book was truly more than I expected.
