Brother MFC7860DW All in One printer
This Brother Laser all-in-one has provided me with all the printing, faxing, copying, and scanning capability that I need in a home office. I am very pleased with the Brother unit and just as pleased with the excellent service that the Amazon vendor provided. This was advertised as a used unit (less) than 50 sheets, and it arrived in like-new condition. The installation went very smoothly... linking wirelessly with my computer. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
