Great product for what it costs
I did a quick test with this set and a 50mm 1.8 II lens. Results are great. You get much more than what you pay for. I read confusing reviews about problems getting the lens off the set. I just have to say: read the manual!! Working ok for EF and EF-S mounts. 100% recommended if you want to try macro before buying an expensive lens.
