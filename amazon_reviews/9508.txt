Worked perfectly
I cleaned the camera's screens very lightly with Acetone then with a dry cloth to remove fingerprints and any grease.  Waited 15 minutes to all the solvent to completely evaporate then peeled and applied the screens.  Very easy, no bubbles and very clear. As an aside I did not have to fight my way into the plastic packaging with scissors it just pops open.  No cut fingers or broken glass screens.  Very thoughtful.
