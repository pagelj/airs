Review count may be misleading
It is clear that the GoPro Hero 3 has significant design issues that are compounded by completely apathetic customer support. Even the three stars here on Amazon are probably too many as there is now evidence that rather then fixing their product, GoPro has hired a law firm to send DMCA take down notices for bad reviews.  [...] GoPro has a poor product and is trying to hide the fact by being a bad corporate citizen. I urge you to purchase something else.
