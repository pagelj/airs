Good For An Interim Writer
If you are looking for something at a reasonable price to just last you for a short period of time, this CD Writer may be for. Because that's exactly the case. It isn't too bad for the first couple months (I will admit that it was fairly user friendly), but that is about all that it will last for. After about two months, it just decided to completely quit writing at all. After about 30 failed discs, I finally realized that it was just a lost cause. In conclusion, the price is not horrible, but do not expect to get more than what you pay for.
