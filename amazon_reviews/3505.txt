No Problems
Some reviews said that the battries are hard to get out of the charger. They are right, you have to work at it to get them out. But they fit perfectly in the Canon charger just like the Canon batteries. They do not run the camera as long as the original battery but it isn't much of a difference. For the price it is a great value.
