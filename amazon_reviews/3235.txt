Great Mount for the Price
I ordered this for my 65" LED. As all the other reviews said, the construction is very sturdy and easily holds the weight of the tv. Even though you have to adjust the tilt angle before you put the tv on the wall mount i still give it 5 stars. The combination of price, excellent materials and quick delivery make this product very worth while. I will be getting another next year when i get the new tv for the living room.
