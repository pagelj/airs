The unit is great as long as it lasts.  My egg poacher lasted for around 6 months and the toaster 6 months past that.  Unfortunately no other company makes a comparable product.  There are two other brands but both are owned by Back to Basics.  I will buy a new one and hope that a company that has a quality control department starts putting out a similar product before this unit craps out as it appears is standard.
