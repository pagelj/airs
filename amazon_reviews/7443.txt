THE PERFECT GO-TO GUIDE!
I ordered this book as a suplement to a beginners online photo class.  WOW!  Julie Adair King has this camera nailed, and her lessons on general photography topics are invaluable!  What a great go-to guide.  I am not reading it cover to cover, but rather in short topics and subjects that are of interest to me at the time. I've really enjoyed just randomly opening the book to find a new tip about my specific camera that I probably would have never learned with the true owners manual and users guide.  The PICTURES ARE FABULOUS and correspond well to the point she is teaching.  The new camera is fantastic, and after just a few days with the Rebel "Dummies Book" I am happy to report that I have totally weaned myself from the "auto" button.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all new Rebel T4i cameras.  You will never open that little owners manual again!
