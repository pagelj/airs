Work Great!
I bought these and the SCI Scandicraft toast tongs at the same time to compare them. Truthfully, I bought them for my boys to do manipulative play with, but tested them for our toaster as well. These work MUCH better than the Scandicraft ones which were awkward and a bit hit and miss to use. I'd been afraid that these would be cheap, but they've held up great so far and are easy both for me and my 2 year old to use. Also, they are cheaper and you get 2, as compared to the Scandicraft. On nice thing about the Scandicraft is that they have a mangnet for storage on your toaster (which my husband likes, but forgets to use) but if that was really important to you, you can always glue a magnet on. Very happy with these.
