Great for iOS homes but lacking in video sources
Pros: The best in home networking with other iOS devices. Connects flawlessly and integrates smoothly. Cons: Besides Netflix and Hulu, there really isn't much this thing offers in the video department. And you're insane if you think I'm gonna rent/buy from the Apple store with their prices. Things like Crackle, Xfinity, HBO/Cinemax Go aren't available so there really isn't much content. Fortunately I still have an Xbox 360.
