I moved to a new house and bought these as I saw the good reviews. The knives are really good. I love cutting with these knives. I did not know till now how much difference a good set of knives can make to your cooking. I am really happy with this set of knives. The one major complain I have is with the packaging. I do not know how other sets are packaged but all my bigger knives are packaged in ridiculously hard sealed plastic clam shell packages that took me a lot of effort and pain to open. I say it is also a major complain because I even cut myself and I am sure that if I am not strong or don't have good sturdy scissors, I will not be able to open these. Just a slim cheap plastic sheath or even a paper/cardboard wrap would have made me give this a 5 star review. I would have also liked some other small paring knives etc instead of 8 small steak knives but I knew what I was buying when I got them. Only mentioning it because some people might not want them.
