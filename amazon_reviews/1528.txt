Great battery with long life if you get the right charger
The last time I bought Eneloop AA batteries was two years ago and then I have eight that were bought four years ago.  Recently all had pretty much lost their ability to carry a full charge so I started looking into replacing them.  While checking the user reviews for the Eneloop AA I found a reference to the La Crosse BC-700U battery charger which praised it's "refresh" mode's ability to bring batteries back to life by automatically discharging and recharging them repeatedly.  So instead of new batteries I took a chance and ordered the BC-700 and have successfully refreshed all the old Eneloop battries.  The BC-700 said that most had a less than 1600mAh capacity before refreshing but all ended up with over the 2000mAh listed on the battery case. Hopefully this will extend their life for a couple more years - maybe get them close to the claimed 1000 recharges. Overall I do highly recommend the Eneloop rechargable batteries but if you are replacing old Eneloops I would recommend purchasing an advanced charger such as the BC-700 to possibly save your old batteries and then use the discharge/recharge function to keep the batteries in top shape.
