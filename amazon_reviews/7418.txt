Great device and price
I am a bit of a computer gadget guy and have always been curious about the chromebooks.  The earlier versions seemed priced to high and they weren't available in Canada anyway.  I read the reviews when the new Samsung Chromebook was being released and was amazed by the price, battery life, weight and overall look.  When we were vacationing in the U. S. I picked up the Samsung and I am pleasantly surprised by what it offers. I really like both the device and the operating system.  This is clearly no frills computing that just works.  I love the simplicity and as a Google Apps for Business user really like the integration with all things Google.  While the chromebook is targeted at Google users it works just as well accessing Outlook. com and Skydrive.  Pretty much anything you can do on the web you can pretty much do on the chromebook with the exception of Netflix which will be available for this ARM based chromebook pretty soon. If I could change one thing I would upgrade the screen but I'm spoiled there as my primary PC is a MacBook Pro with retina display and my iPad also has a retina display.  In comparison to those higher resolution IPS displays the chromebook display is pretty plain.  A version with a better IPS screen for around $299 would be perfect. If you're not use to a retina display the display on the chromebook will not disappoint.  It is certainly adequate for the price and overall this is a great little machine.  I look forward to travelling with this computer because it is so light.
