should tell you use is limited with the 4GB hard drive
After I got it, discovered you could not use old games without a bigger hard drive and a adapter so I gave the old and its games away. I have 11 grand kids, 6 big enought to play. On the old xbox,they each could have their on campaign going with the name attached. AS best we can tell, if you have a big enough hard drive, and supscribe to xbo live ( a montlhy fee to pay) you can set up different names for each kid and the have to play though that. if there is another way I would like to know.  Seems like Mcrosoft is joining phone companies and cable conpanies on milking customers for every penny they can out of them.
