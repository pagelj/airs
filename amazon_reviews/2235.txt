After purchasing Breville's countertop convection oven, and finding it to be my new favorite appliance, when the time came to purchase a new toaster, we looked at Breville first. Some of the reviews were mixed, but our experience so far has been great. Very easy to use, consistent quality toast, and frankly, fun to push the buttons. We liked the toaster so much, we just purchased a really neat Breville teapot. No cheap tools. Buy the quality product, you will rarely be disappointed.
