The look and feel of this trash can seems to be of good quality but something is off with the mechanics of the opening and closing.  A few times a day the can will stopping opening when you motion towards it.  The fix to this seems to be to hold the "close" button for a few seconds and then you are back in business.  I wouldn't mind this if it was something you needed to day once a week or so but several times a day?!? Also, sometimes the lid will open and immediately close leaving you no time to even toss something in.  I thought replacing the batteries may have something to do with it(even though they were new when I put them in, but unfortunately that has not remedied the situation. Hey, it works as a trash can but it's not worth the premium you pay for the sometimes functional motion sensor...
