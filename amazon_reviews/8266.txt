Nothing fancy construction wise, but it does what it says and is packed with features at a good price.
Gave it a trial run, and it played my "Fritz the Cat" DVD I was duped into buying that I ultimately found could only be played in Region 2 DVD players.  It was an economical solution to the problem. I also have a Tom & Jerry DVD that contains the Gene Deitch era shorts that can only be played in European DVD players.  I have yet to try that one out.  Can't wait.
