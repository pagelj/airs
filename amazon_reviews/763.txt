Like,  but there are troubles in River City Flats.....
The side container for holding the water to boil and cook eggs is all rusting out after only three uses.  The rust is like a deposition of salts onto the surface of the chrome plated concave dish.  What can I do to have this unit replaced???  We like what it does but we realize it will not last long because of the salted corrosion of the surface of the water heating  surface.  Please advise me accordingly !!!!  The last toaster my wife and I had for more than 14 years, we bought it the year after we moved into our present house.
