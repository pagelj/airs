nice design; apart from scratching, my set has held up well
I have owned this set for three and a half years now and don't have any problems with rust on any of my pieces.  Given that I purchased my set in late 2003, I am wondering whether sets manufactured later were made with lesser quality.  How else to explain the number of reviewers who note a problem with the knives rusting?  The only other thought I have is that perhaps these people are simply not taking care of their knives well.  I hand wash everything.  Maybe these just aren't up to the abuse an automatic dishwasher subjects items to?  I don't know. At any rate, if the quality is still the same as it was three and a half years ago, I would certainly still recommend this set.  I have managed to scratch the handles on many of my pieces (small scratches) from ordinary use, washing, and placing them into a container to dry (probably how they are getting scratched, rubbing up against other pieces of flatware), but apart from that the set still looks nice. I like the feel of the fork and spoon in this set.  I actually don't like the feel of the knife very much; the handle is just a little too sleek for anything but the smallest of hands.
