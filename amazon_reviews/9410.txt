So far so great...
I'm so happy with this purchase. After looking around the stores for a large zipper tote, I was convinced that I would need to spend a ridiculous amount of money to get what I was looking for. Nevertheless, I found this bag and am very pleased thus far. There are numerous pockets to keep things organized (I use this as my everyday/diaper bag) an it's very sturdy and stylish to boot. The only thing I don't like is the lining (I'm probably one of the few people that aren't into animal print) but it's not a deal breaker. I've only had this bag for a couple of weeks, so I will update this review after I've had enough time to really break it in. But if all goes well, I'm thinking about getting another one in a different color.
