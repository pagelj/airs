Looks are deceiving.
I searched for a long time to find a purse that I hoped was just right.  This one appeared sturdy, easy entry, roomy, etc.  Consequently, it is VERY disappointing that after that long search, the exterior of this purse is cheap, and is beginning to peel off in LESS THAN A MONTH!!  As it is black, the little white places where the black exteriour came off are very noticeable.  In addition, the walls are very thin and holes are beginning to appear.  Ordered on 3/27/13, unfortunately the return window expired 5/2/13.
