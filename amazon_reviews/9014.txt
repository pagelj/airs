Strong, Sturdy, and Excellent Price!
Don't bother spending $100+ on a TV mount when you can get this Cheetah mount for less than half the price.  I was somewhat skeptical at first, since I had never tried to mount my 46" samsung on a wall before.  As long as you locate the studs and attach the TV correctly, it not only looks awesome but could probably survive an earthquake.  It makes the TV easier to view from all angles, and is an excellent space-saver for smaller living rooms or bedrooms.  I bought this for my living room along with a wall-mount shelving unit for the cable box and dvd, and with proper wiring it looks like it was professionally installed.  Seriously, this is such a good deal I will be buying a wall mount for every tv in every room of my house that I put one!
