AWESOME CAMERA
Once you RTFM, this camera is awesome.  You definitely need to tweak some settings instead of shooting everything in "AUTO" mode.  If you want a point-and-shoot, get something different.  This camera has more settings than most normal people would even bother to mess with, but that's exactly what I was looking for.  If you're thinking about dabbling into photography, or just want to get all artsy and take some cool shots, this camera is the one you want.  Zoom feature is awesome and really powerful. NOTE: Get some rechargeable AA batteries or else you'll go through batteries faster than the Energizer bunny.  I bought this camera specifically because I wanted one that ran on AA's.  I've had it with battery packs and chargers failing, having to buy ones that are almost as much as a new camera.  With AA's, you ALWAYS have power no matter what.  Just get some rechargeable Ni-Cad's.  They'll last longer and you'll help save the planet!  Not really, but they WILL last longer.
