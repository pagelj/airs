Mind You, This Is 2 Stars For Helena, Not The Album
Ok, I have to tell you, I have only heard one song by My Chemical Romance.  As you probably have deciphered from the title of this review, that particular song happened to be "Helena."  I heard this song by seeing the video off of MTV.  Personally, I found it a bit obnoxious.  The lead singer of the band, Gerard Way (who I think looks a hell of a lot like The Smashing Pumpkins Billy Corgan) looks as though he is about to break into tears throughout the majority of the video.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not slandering this band, saying that they "suck" and trying to persuade you not to buy "Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge."  Here is what I recommend; Listen to some samples off of Amazon right now!  If you like the music, then I say you should pick up a copy of the new album.  If you do not care for My Chemical Romance, like I do, you should not purchase a copy.  Remember, I have only heard 1/13 of the album.  This is certaintly not enough to judge and I know that I could not do any better myself.  Why don't you give MCR a try?  Give 'Em Hell, Kid!
