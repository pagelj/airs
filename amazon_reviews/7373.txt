Great Book
I typically have problems finishing books. I start one and never finish it. This wasn't the case with this book though, after I finished the first book in this edition, I didn't want to carry on. Then I just forced myself to start the second book and didn't want to put it down afterwards. The book continually gripped me by the balls and forced me to read. I actually lost a hour of sleep a few days ago due to a cliff hanger. I finished the book in less than a week and am glad I did. The end of the book left on a semi-cliff hanger though and can't wait till the 6th book is published. Not anything all that important but that one detail would be nice to know. Well I will be buying the 6th book as soon as it comes out.
