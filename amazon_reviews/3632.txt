Works "OK"
There is nothing impressive about this microphone. The range is abysmal, and I generally have to have it pretty close to any audio source to catch anything that won't require a lot of messing around in Audition. If you're getting this as an on-cam mic for your video productions, look elsewhere. This thing is decent enough to use for interviews when you can crop in close enough to keep it out of frame (really close, since the mic needs to be very close, even on tele). Nowadays, I mostly just use it for talking on Skype or things of that nature. If you're considering buying this as an on-cam shotgun mic, do not. You will be disappointed. I know it's tempting because it's cheap. But you will be disappointed. If you're considering buying this for doing interviews or podcasts, you could do a lot better. You could also do a lot worse. If you are absolutely obsessed with getting this, it will be ok for these uses. However, there are also better mics out there for as much or cheaper if you take a moment to look.
