Seller great, product not so great
While my overall experience with this seller was good, the product I received was not working properly. The seller shipped the product quickly and they were easy to communicate with when we found that the product didn't work. They were understanding and let me return the product for a full refund. The VCR part of the device wasn't working. The picture was choppy and the audio was static-y. The DVD portion worked perfectly though. I'm not sure what happened, but the seller apologized and gave a full refund, so I am not really upset or anything. I would still purchase from this seller, as it was clear that this was an unfortunate accident.
