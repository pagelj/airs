The Keurig B60 SE is a really well-made machine and it makes coffee brewing a breeze.  The machine brews a cup of coffee in about 30 seconds which makes the getting my morning cup of joe a cinch.  The varieties of K-cups available are many and it is quite fun to pop a K-cup in the Keurig and watch the machine do its thing.  However... I have a few gripes about this machine. First of all, unless an extra-bold K-cup is used, the coffee comes out a bit too weak and watery for my liking.  Perhaps the super-fast water passage through the small K-cups limits the amount of coffee extracted from the grounds.  The amount of coffee cannot be adjusted while the amount of water passed through the given/unchangeable amount of coffee beans can be changed with the machine (therefore having to rely on extra-bold K-cups, which limits the variety of coffees available for purchase).  Secondly, the essential part of coffee brewing I enjoy, the aroma, is largely missed using this type of brewing method. I have used the reusable My K-cups but the quality of coffee that is brewed is not the same as a cup brewed with a traditional drip coffee machine. I use the Keurig in the morning when I have little time to brew but when I do have the time, I like to grind my own beans and have control over the bean:water ratio using the auto-drip machine method... or the french-press method :-)
