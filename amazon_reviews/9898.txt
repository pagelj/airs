Very good affordable laptop
It is a very good product. I bought it because I needed serial port, which is very rare in modern laptops. There are lots of USB to serial adaptors on sale, but they mostly incompatible. I created DOS partition on harddrive because my obsolete program was DOS based, but then I discovered that the program worked very well from Windows XP also. I had very bad experience before running my obsolete program on laptops so I simply did not expect such great compatibility! Besides this I use the laptop for my high definition video, which requires a powerful computer. The video runs very smoothly with really high quality. The battery also is very good. It lasts almost forever. The option of additional battery instead of CD/DVD drive is also a very good feature. Indeed it is a great computer and the price is also great!
