Luv this Monitor!!!
I frequently watch my grandson who is now 18 months . I bought this when he was a very active 13 month old. The monitor is user friendly. It has a clear, sharp picture which has an adjustable dark to light setting, adjustable volume and changeable lullaby tunes. This also has a temp reading, which is what I wanted since the rooms on the north side of the house get colder in the winter. You can add more than one camera, which I want to do in the future. If I am watching him over night, I plug the monitor in to the charger on my night stand. I feel secure being able to see and hear him. On occasion our power goes out at night, the monitor will alert you if it loses signal, this is a plus for us especially in the winter. We don't wake up to a cold house, I can call the power company when it happens. The only down fall to this set up is the monitor's charge only lasts a few hours. I gave this a five because the quality and features are awesome, I have learned to adjust to the length of the charge.
