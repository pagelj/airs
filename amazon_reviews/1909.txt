Poor Customer service-Roku 3 a very Bad choice
Roku 3 . This was supposed to be an update. It is a disaster. I use it with LAN wired. It odes not stream live programs any more. The News channel newscaster is just prerecorded items. Aljazeera streamed at first and now can't stream. Support is very lacking. The support people don't know about the product. The wait is very long. The Roku 3 does not allow you to buy other Angry Bird games. I Just comes with Angry Bird Space. The previous model was much better and no problems. I can still view Netflix and Amazon 1 star. I wish Amazon would let this company know the Roku 3 has problems
