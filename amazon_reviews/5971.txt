Unhappy!
I own a set of these knives. I purchased another set for my mother for Christmas. I am very disappointed with the quality of this set. The handles exceed the metal of the tang by a noticeable amount of space on every knife. They look sloppy and thrown together. The craftsmanship of these knives is very poor I. The particular set I recently received.
