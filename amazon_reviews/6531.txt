Amazon price not comptitive
So far the computer runs fine and has no problems. I am still transitioning from being a PC user to a mac user and I like the gestures feature on the trackpad. What I am not satisfied with is that Amazon did not have competitive price for this Macbook. I have always trusted Amazon for the lowest price, so much so that I stopped comparing prices around. However, 3 days after purchasing this Macbook Pro, I found the exact same macbook in Frys for more than $100 less! It taught me to compare prices before purchasing anything from Amazon in future!
