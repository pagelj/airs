What about the children?
Ender's Game is basically about a bunch of child geniuses who are being trained to defend the world against the bugger aliens and six year old Ender is the smartest of them all. The early training takes the place of games, little mock battles. The book did a good job of holding my interest and I liked the story. There were several things in the book that bugged (er, bothered) me. For one, the children that are supposed to save the world are really young, Ender himself starts training at age six. But they don't act like children, maybe that's the point, but it didn't seem believable. Even if I can buy that they don't think or talk like children because they are geniuses, they would still move like children because their bodies are different. I kept forgetting how young they were and in my mind I actually imagined them as teenagers. Another thing I didn't like was the subplot lines of Ender's siblings. It doesn't show up until about half-way through the book and is vague and under explained. Many things in the book felt a bit contrived. The writing itself wasn't super impressive, but the story idea and the concept was fantastic. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and feel that it would be interesting to most readers.
