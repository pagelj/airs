Works great
Really came in handy during "Sandy" when my New Trent batteries were all I had to recharge my devices (especially my cell phone).  Allowed me to recharge multiple times very easily... Suggestion: Needs better labeling to make it easier to determine which is the 2 AMP and which is the 1 AMP port for charging.
