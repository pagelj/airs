serviceable but overpriced
This item does what I bought it for - protects my device - and I find the color and feel of it attractive. Holding it in one hand is awkward unless you bend the front cover all the way around behind, and the connection between the front cover and the rest is not flexible enough to make me feel totally safe doing this. The $40.00 price tag seems excessive.
