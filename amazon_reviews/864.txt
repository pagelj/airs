Top notch new self-pub work!!
Great military sci-fi! The military background and naval accuracy are pitch perfect. The action is intense in the crecendo. The story world is dynamic and involved. Great commentary on modern politics and society. My only critiques... the head hopping in the end was a little jarring, but manageable, and maybe one more round of copy editing.
