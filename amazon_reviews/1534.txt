Awesome triangle sandwich maker, omelette's & French  toast too.
I first saw this product on e-bay advertised as a Chrome Sandwich maker for [...], it is Silver colored and not Chrome, but looks good in our Stainless & Black Kitchen motif we have going on and works great plus a 3 year warranty for under [...] bucks, such a good deal and works great too.
