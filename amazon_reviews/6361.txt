Technical Support
Very satisfied with the setup support that I had received with this camera.. Very thorough and the technician was very knowledgable about the camera and the set up.. I didn't even have to do too much on my end,.. she pretty much did it all.  If it wasn't for the tech support, I would have a difficult time indeed setting it up.. For the support feature alone, I would highly recommend this camera.
