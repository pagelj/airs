White USB cable for Apple iPhone 3G
One of the white sync and charge cables did not work; I requested a refund or replacement of the defective cable on June 7, 20211; I received a prompt response indicating that the customer service rep had requested a replacement of the item on June 7, 2011;  I have heard nothing further from anyone. Granted the cable didn't cost very much; I paid what was requested and expected to have a working product. Regardless of the cost of an item, if it doesn't work, it is worthless.  By them not responding to me has caused me to never want to do any business with them in the future.
