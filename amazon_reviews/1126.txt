Kindle touch
I am sure that the machine is terrific BUT. There was no instructions on how to set it up.  I have as yet heard from the Amazon help on the Kindle and I have had it awhile and would love to be able to use it.  I bought a book to learn how  but it requires entrance to Kindle.  I am very disappointed.
