Just a little bit more...
What is there not to love about Keely and Jack? The answer nothing. Slow Ride is just a little bit more of one of the two most beloved Lorelei characters. And the fact that it was free just goes to show you how awesome Lorelei is. This is a great transition book between All Jacked up and Cowgirls don't cry. Which if you haven't read, you can't fairly judge this book. That goes the same for the rest of the Rough Riders books which happens to be just as awesome. Sarah
