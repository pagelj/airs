OMG!
If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. The 5-star reviews are all correct. So disregard that one person who gave it one star (So the guy has no right to grieve like he does just because he once enjoyed a dominant relationship with his wife, who obviously loved him? What, just because this is an erotica book with some elements of sex not everyone enjoys, he has no right to be in his cups and contemplating getting out of his misery? I don't know about others, but I have some respect for other people's losses, even if the people in question are fictional characters. Oh, and right after the "off-putting" behavior, the guy goes on to save a 16-year old girl from a couple of thugs). Anyway, this is a book that truly grabbed at my heart, the first in a very long time. The characters are amazing. Their circumstances believable. Their feelings true. If this is truly the author's first book, than bravo! We have a genius!
