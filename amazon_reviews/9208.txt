Almost good...
When I was putting the phone back together with the new screen, the touch screen ribbon-connector tore off. I was gently pulling  both connectors through the little hole in the phone and the smaller touch-screen ribboncame off. Disappointing to say the least. I was trying to save a few bucks...  :(
