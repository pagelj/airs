Lacks Reasonable Durability
This bag does fit a 17" laptop, and it does have a fairly nice design, especially for the price. However, I would not recommend that anyone should purchase this product. When I first received this backpack, I found a few loose stitches in the seams.  I simply clipped them short and applied fabric glue -- no big deal. However, after several months of use at school ( about a semester ) many of the seams have started to tear up, and the bag is generally falling apart.  This is probably where the price comes in to play. Overall, my bag was crap after a few months of regular use.*** Note:  Read the positive reviews and notice that most of them seem to have been written after receiving the product, and not after several months of use. ***
