Manufacturing defect
Although the pricing on this oven is great and features look better good. My wife opened this on Christmas morning and loved the quality look and features. However, when I opened this a small screw fell out of the oven and found it was a screw that connected the convection oven fan to the wall of the oven. It looks like I would have to take apart the entire oven to replace. Very small threads on the screw. I realize it's just to circulate the air to get quicker baking but a worthwhile feature. Anyway, I will update again as I will order a replacement from Amazon. I think given the size of this oven, it would be a great secondary oven to use when main oven is full.
