A celebration of survival
One of the few books I have read where I really felt I got to know the main character and really liked him.  Humorous (laugh out loud at times) and touching at other moments, this book is intelligently and cleverly written.  You follow the saga of Mark Whatney, an astronaut left behind for dead on Mars, and cheer, laugh and cry at his struggle to survive as he awaits rescue.
