Woohoo!
This computer is pretty sweet. Intel i3 processor is nifty. Windows 8 is nifty... once you get the hang of it. Touchscreen is nifty. Trackpad shortcuts are nifty... once you get the hang of them. There's not really a built-in tutorial or anything, and it's not super intuitive, so learning takes a bit of time and research. But it's pretty slick once you get used to it. The touchpad acts up when there are updates, but I think it will probably get sorted out eventually. Also, Windows' app store kind of sucks for the time being. They don't get along with Google, so the few Google apps there are are not very developed, or cost money where they wouldn't on Google Play (i. e. with Android). There is no good Youtube app yet. But I think it will probably get better with time. As a Windows computer, it does everything and more. So yeah, no real complaints here. Rock on!
