Works Great!
It was delivered (for free, without Prime) within 2 days. I went on a trip this past weekend with it, forgetting my normal charger. It was able to keep my Galaxy S3 alive for 2 days. It's also great in the car if you have two people that need to charge their phone. I hook it up to the car charger and use the cord it came with along with a normal cord for charging and charge both phones. Everybody is happy. You are able to charge your phone while it is hooked up to a charger, it acts as a simple pass through. I couldn't have better things to say about it.
