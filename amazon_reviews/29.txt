Great camera!
I decided to go with a SLR camera after being annoyed by the long delay of a regular digital camera.  There is a little bit of delay with this one but not nearly enough of one to bother me. This camera is so easy to use.  I usually put it in different modes to take the same picture just so I can see the variations. The best thing is the panorama mode.  You take 1 picture and then turn either right or left and in the view finder it shows you exactly where to stop to line up a perfect shot next to the one you just took.  It really is a neat function.  You can do this with 2 or 3 shots and set it up to go right or left.  I'm always amazed at how much can be done in such a small package.  I did buy a case for this to carry extra batteries and a battery charger but you can throw this in your purse, too.  If, like me, you carry a big purse.  It's not small like a camera phone but its not huge either.  This is the best compact camera I have ever bought and the results are terrific!
