I bought this as a gift for my wife when her Kenmore died.  I gave it a try based on all the reviews here, got it for $159 at Lowes on sale for 20% off. It took me less tham 5 minutes to unpack and put together.  I am not mechanically inclined, and this was very simple for me to follow the directions and snap it together. We had an early CHristmas at my inlaws, and after putting it together, I vacuumed the carpet that my father in law had done earlier in the day.  It was stunning to see how much dirt this picked up.  My mother-in-law could not believe it. Overall, my wife and I are VERY happy with this purchase and the quality of it!  It is light and easy to maneuver around, and the hard wood floor attachment is perfect.  Much better than our ld Swiffer wet jet!!!!!!!! UPDATE!!!!!!!! on March 1, 2012.... still working strong and perfectly.  VERY VERY happy with this purchase!!!!!!! Update!!!!!!!! on December 10, 2012we are still extremely happy with our purchase.  Never really loved how well a vacuum works until this one.  Vacuuming our 3 bedroom house, den, living room, and dining room does require 3 times to empty it, but is amazing/gross how much dirt is in the carpets and gets sucked up (and we vacuum once a week).  Highly recommend!
