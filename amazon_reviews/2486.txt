Paints too rosy a picture
I was looking forward to reading this book. However, it's not nearly as easy to make money online as he makes it out to be. Buying :Facebook and Twitters followers, for instance, from Fivver. com, is worthless. You need to build up your own customer list from people who actually care about your product or service. This author is little different from the former, mostly bankrupt, late night hucksters who promised riches with real estate investing. As someone who has been involved in that field, I can tell you it takes much work and hours to close deals. The same with internet marketing. These guys are selling info on how to sell info on how to sell info... It becomes like a pyramid scheme almost. I have had one of the best selling books  - a diet book - that was marketed on radio/print and tv for a long time. This book has a few good ideas, but overall, don't quit your day job to do this stuff. It is way more difficult and time consuming and there are no guarantees of success. It's like starting any business.
