Great Streamer!
I bought this streamer to upgrade from an old Roku XR and this unit navigates much faster & the video quality with 10Mbps downstream is 1080p (similar speed & video quality to my Apple TV). I use this streamer for Amazon Instant Video (both Prime & my purchased videos), HuluPlus, Weather Underground, Pandora, MLB. TV, NHL Gamecenter Live, & PBS. It works great all of the time & I do like it much better than the old Roku XR because of the video quality, universal search feature, RF remote (I have the unit hidden on the back of my tv) & speed of navigation in all menus. Highly recommended!
