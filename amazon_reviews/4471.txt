palm pixi plus
I needed a replacement for my Palm Pre Plus which unfortunately drowned in a cup of tea - long story. The Pixi arrived very quickly, was easy to set up and is working great.  It's easier to text with than the Pre and a lighter package.  I've found these palm devices to be very reliable if you keep them out of liquids!  The wi-fi feature is a nice way to hedge using data time.  Thanks Amazon!
