Go for something else if you want to use it to vacuum carpet of any sorts.  Does a decent job with small debris, but does pretty much nothing on my car carpets.  I charged it for 24+hours like the manual recommended, and it lasted a little over 15 minutes, didnt even finish vacuuming my car.  Had to charge it for another 24 + hours to squeeze another 15 mins out of it.
