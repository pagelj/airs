Very good phone
I bought this phone for the sole purpose of tethering on my iPad, which is on wifi only. Instead of buying a mifi wifi, this serves well doubling as a phone.... All SIM cards work perfectly as the phone is unlocked. I connected my laptop, iPad, BB, and Hubby's laptop at the same. Browsing speed was faster than Modem sticks (those I have used), 7mbps, with all connected devices. It is meant for 5 devices actually. Shipping was super fast! I have been recommending this phone to friends. The phone falls apart on touch down (am a mum with a toddler that enjoys seeing my phone fly ... LOL), I will surgest you buy a casing immediately.
