Good Phone!
My 21 month old took to this right way.  My phone has the slide-out & wanted this one so he might leave mine alone.  I do believe he'll use it more as he's older & can follow what it says so it'll be the gift that keeps on giving.... good toy phone (especially since I was specifically looking for non-pieces-of-crap, lol).
