One hell of a deal for only $9.99 here at Amazon!
OMG, I paid $19.99 for this phone at Radio Shack and I thought it was a killer deal.  This phone is on sale here at Amazon at the amazing low price of $9.99!!!  I like this phone because it boots up fairly fast.  I do have problems with certain large headphones having difficulties inserting the headphone jack into the phone.
