Really a fun TV series to watch and to own!
Having watched the entire series when it first came out on TV it was truly a joy to watch each episode again.  It's just as funny the second (and third time) when I've watched them again.  Anyone who enjoys original prgramming, excellent writing and acting will love this set!
