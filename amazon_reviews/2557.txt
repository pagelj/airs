Far exceeded my expectations
The first time I played this was on a friend's iPod. It seemed boring because he had a fully functioning little town. I put this on my Kindle HD, and haven't regretted it since. The concept was easy to understand, the controls were simple to pick up, and the overall theme just fits. The music is alright if you've got nothing else to do, but I like to put on some heavy metal while playing this. Just for the contradictory feeling that puts a smile on my face. Overall, I'm pleased with the game. It's a wonder why they don't make people pay a dollar for this. It'd be worth it.
