Not worth buying a refurbished phone..!
When refurbished comes from a company or reputable warehouse, it's OK somehow you can trust the amount of care the product got before it got shipped, twice Q&A is better than one. This product was not cleaned properly and it wasn't worth the price.  Someone outside Amazon called me and asked me to remove my review he had all my info and gave me a partial refund of 20%, however its still not cool, that wasn't cool with me I won't buy products from this seller again, and I am less than pleased with the experience.
