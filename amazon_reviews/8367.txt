Great Case
I needed something for my Macbook Pro 13" and didn't want to pay $60 bucks at the apple store. This was a great price for this item and it has plenty of room for my external hard drives, cables, and misc other items. Zippers are sturdy, the carrying handle and strap will definitely last. There is enough padding to protect my investment for years to come. I recommend this product for such a great price.
