Best HDMI cable PERIOD!
I have to say I have tried all kinds of cables from cheap to High end and these are by far the best I have found. I have order many cables that did not work and had to be returned. I actually have a collection of about 10-15 HDMI cables I am nto currently using. I just updated my home entertainment system and wanted to make sure I had the latest and greatest cables. I bought 2  of these Mediabridges cables and love them. I needed one more cable and wanted one with more flex so I got the high flex model. Let me say it will bend around a pencil with ease and the video quality is incredible. I highly recommend any cable from Mediabridge. I will be ordering more in the future.
