Dual-DVD Case
Order was received fairly quickly. I bought the Phillips 9 inch dual DVD system for my car so wanted a case that would allow both screens to fit into. This one does it with some room to spare. All the cables easily fit and there was an extra storage compartment in the front flap. You can also keep one of the screens in the case & mount the whole case to the seat back if you need a place to store it during the trip.
