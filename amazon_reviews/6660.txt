Lots of power but rather bulky
I call this battery my "convention power."  I have an iPhone (and you know that the battery life is abysmal).  I attend multi-day conventions with meetings and dinners taking me from early morning to late at night.  I'm able to stay connected to my calendar and constant work e-mails via my phone... as long as it has a charge.  The New Trent has enough juice to last me days of use.  I typically fully charge the battery before my trip and that's it.  It'll last.  It's not slim and it doesn't have the Apple aesthetic but it works.  People I meet with at the conventions are quite envious of my charging capability.
