Plausible science, interesting fiction
I must admit that I would rather have good and interesting science over good and interesting characterisation.  This book certainly delivers on the science side - a fascinating look at someone aging a few years while the  Earth ages a few centuries, and the consequences thereof.  I have never  believed that interstellar war could be possible if Einstein's speed of  light limit is never worked around, but this novel keeps this limitation  and works with it in a well-thought out and fascinating way. I also  enjoyed the military portrayal - unlike the so-called military in Star Trek  and other science fantasy works, this book rings true, from bewildering  orders from superiors to questions about order validity (especially  interesting is the point where Mandella, the main character, is the CO of  the base and he is warned not to leave his office because he'd probably be  murdered).  It reminds me of Starship Troopers (the book, not the movie,  perish the thought!) in presenting what I feel is a plausible science  fiction military. This review may make the book sound sterile, but rest  assured there are interesting characters, compelling conflicts, and all the  rest that is required to make a great book.  Recommeded.
