Awesome flash! Worth twice the money.
I got this to go along with a Nikon D40 that I bought for my wife. It's difficult to see from the product pictures, but the flash head tilts so that you can bounce the flash off the ceiling to create much warmer images. It has a very quick recovery time and isn't a battery hog (however I would recommend using rechargeable batteries).
