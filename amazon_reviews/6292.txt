Lite-On... you pays your money and you takes your chances
This is the second Lite-On DVD writer I've bought in the past few months. The first one first stopped reading commercial discs, but would still read and write DVD-Rs; then, it stopped reading even those. Updating the firmware as tech support suggested worked for a single read/burn cycle, then it stopped again. The second drive is still going after ~50 burns, so far so good. Beware of Lite-On's support: they don't think you'll return the defective drive if they send you a replacement first (even though they don't actually repair the drive you send to them, but send you another refurbished drive). And all Lite-On support is email only, so don't think you'll get help if you need it quickly. Nevertheless, for the price, it's an acceptable DVD writer.
