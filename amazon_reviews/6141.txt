Very nice touch-screen laptop
This laptop is well-designed and well-equipped. Windows 8 runs smooth on it with many useful apps. The touch screen is a must-have for Windows 8 and I am still surprised by new features. The sound quality is very good considering the small size and the thickness of the laptop. The screen is crispy and watching movies on it is fun. The keyboard is very comfortable and the touchpad is very responsive. Even though it has only an i3 CPU and no SSD to boost the HDD, I think everything still runs fast but I only use it for entertainments and light office tasks. Only one very small complaint: The DC power connector has a protruding part and it rotates freely so sometimes when I put the laptop on a flat surface it does not sit flat and left side of the laptop may hit the surface later on. This looks dangerous considering the fact that it has an HDD which is prone to shocks.
