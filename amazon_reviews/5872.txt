Perfect screen protector
I have always thought screen protectors were kinda lame. They always seem to fit and look bad and detract from the beauty of the iPhone. Plus I haven't really ever scratched my phone so I wasn't too worried about it. That is until I started to get really annoyed with all the fingerprints and "greasy" look on the screen. I would clean the screen and almost immediately it would look terrible again. The Tech Armor screen protector has a matte finish so you don't retain any finger prints and it has a nice texture to it. The anti-glare seems to be helpful too when using the phone out doors. This is a great value and with the 3 pack, it should easily last the life of the phone. The application was super easy and the tech armor demo video definitely helped.
