Nice card for the money
I use this card in my Canon 60D camera with both HD video and pictures... No issues so far. Card has no issues handling HD 1080p video. It seems to be transferring in the 16-17MB/s range.. i had bought a Sandisk 16GB Extreme card as well but should have just started out with this one....
