good and high quality battery for reasonable price
I bought this one for ~$60 on amazon. It's a bargain already since its original price (last year) was $120 and up. This is a high quality, high capacity battery with some integrated information chip (which show you the history of battery, recharge, no. of shots taken, etc.). It's not something luxury - just a "nice to have" feature.
