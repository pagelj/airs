I am alone and used to be a huge coffee drinker.  If I make a pot I will drink it all.  With the single serve I can have my fresh cup or two during the day.  There are some coffee grounds that make their way through but that isn't a real bad problem.  I just throw out the last swallow in the bottom of the cup.  I may try the little paper filters or see if that solves the problem. Coffee is much more economical by the pound rather in the single serve cups also.
