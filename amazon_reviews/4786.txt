UV filter - good price and value
FOr the most part, this is the least exciting filter you will ever purchase.  Yawn!  Look at it - it is clear.  It does nothing that you can see.  That is the point with this.  Most of what it provides is protection and safety. Note that this is NOT one of the thin type filters that allow you to stack several on a lens without getting that nasty vignetting.  However, that being said, I did stack this filter and a CPL filter on the 18-55mm kit lnes yesterday with no problem.
