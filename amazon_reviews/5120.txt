Best lens amoung few choices for my Canon 30D.
I am a quazi professional photographer; meaning I have a small business in which I do commercial photography for several clients, which I started after I retired from my main profession (which was not in photography). My first digital SLR was a Canon 30D and have the wide angle zoom, mid focal zoom and then purchased this zoom. I had been very impressed with the quality of the other two Canon zooms (I had about 30 years experience with Honeywell-Pentex, then Minolta). When I got this zoom it felt "cheaply made" by comparision. I took some test photos and decided to return it. I then bought the Tamron 70-300 zoom which has AF but not IS, but cost only $125. That lens seemed better built, but when retaking my previous test shots, I found it had some flare at the edges and was not as crisp and clear when enlarged greatly. Those two items would not be a big issue unless you work with large photos or enlarge small sections. The biggest problem was no IS. When shooting anywhere near 300mm, you ended up without a clear photo, unless using a tripod. Soooooo, back went the Tamron and I bought this Canon lens.... yes, again. I couldn't see any other choices that include IS AND were much less money, so this seemed my only choice. Bottom line: lens performs well, IS motor is a bit slow and noisey, and it is pricey, but there really isn't any other alternatives.
