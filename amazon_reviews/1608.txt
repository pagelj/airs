not bad
This is a book for those seeking drama type booksI f you are looking for action, than thi is not the book for you. It's a little different from the previous books. There are more characters an it's not as exciting. This book is more of a relation type story. I have read all the percy Jackson books an this i s the most boring Percy Jackson book in my opinion. I say this in respect of the author. It's not a bad book at all in general. it is just not the book for those who are seeking action.-I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL- :)
