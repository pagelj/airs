This is how to write a sci-fi adventure starring a child character
I'm usually skeptical of stories that star children as the main protagonist. I particularly disliked how the Harry Potter made Harry played upon all the old tropes of child heroes (orphaned, mean stepparents, talks to animals, etc) and portrayed him as superior by birth. By contrast, Orson Scott Card gets it mostly right with Ender Wiggins in Ender's Game. Ender is brilliant - a bit too much so for my taste - but he's also a child and emotionally frail. The real story isn't how Ender defeats the bad guys, but rather how Ender deals with the rigors of training and engaging in battle. The only part of the story I thought went to far is the subplot with Ender's siblings, Peter and Valentine, who plot to take over the world. It's a bit silly seeing two kids writing brilliant political op-eds and it actually doesn't have a whole lot to do with the main story of Ender in Battle School. Other than that, a recommended read for sic-fi fans. The audio narration is particularly good and is Scott's preferred medium for telling the story.
