Neat and sticky
Very compact. Seems sturdy. Can't understand the reviewer who said it doesn't stick. Did you take the protective plastic off? Actually my only complaint is that when I put it down on my kitchen counter it stuck so tight to the granite that I had to pull the release tab with a pliers to get it off! I'm actually dropping a star for that reason. There needs to be better way of releasing it from the surface. The one touch release for the phone itself is very slick and the grip is as tight as you'd need. I prefer this open style as it doesn't interfere with connectors etc. All adjustments are done without thumbscrews and it packs away small enough to travel with. I will probably use it as much in the office as in the car as I use the speakerphone on the iPhone 4S a lot.
