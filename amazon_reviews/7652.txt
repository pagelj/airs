The Perfect Set of Knives
I am thrilled with my recent purchase of the 18-piece steel knife set from Amazon. It has everything I could want -- utility knives that serve various functions, eight steak knives (not 6, like most sets), an attractive butcher block holder, a built-in knife sharpener, kitchen scissors with bottle and can-tab openers on the handle, and best of all, no wooden handles that can become warped if you leave the knives soaking. The sleek design is more modern than I would normally choose, but it works perfectly fine with my informal life. The knives are nicely balanced. I would strongly recommend this set of knives to anyone. Great value, great price. No need to spend several hundred dollars.
