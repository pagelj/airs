I hate this coffee maker and I can't wait to get a better one. Do you want coffee grounds all over the place? Do you want to have to clean this coffee maker after every use? You have to be very careful when you line up the basket into the coffee maker or else it will just spill coffee grounds and water all over the place. A piece of junk and a waste of money.
