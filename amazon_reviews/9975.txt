Great Product
After hearing so many bad reports of the Hero3, I was pretty wary about spending $400 on it. The first thing I did after receiving it was manually update the firmware, since it seemed that a lot of other people have had success with that. I also made sure to use a Class 10 32GB micro SD card. No issues so far! Not a single freeze or issue that I have noticed. Also the battery life isn't as bad as I was expecting either. It charges in about 1-2 hours, and will take a good hour or more of beautiful video on a full charge. Also I'm really impressed with how much the image quality has improved over the Hero2. The Hero2 and Hero3 Black video side by side is no comparison. Overall it was worth $400, and I hope to get lots more video with it.
