While on a trip back home to visit family, I was invited to a home-cooked ham dinner by my Mom. When it came time to carve it, I was presented with the honors. I went through five carving knives from my Moms odd assortment, none of which would take an edge well enough to do the job. When I returned home I ordered this knife set and had it shipped to my Mom as a gift. Now she raves about how great they are every time I talk with her. I also gave the same set as a wedding gift, which was appreciated equally as well by the newly-wed recipients. You simply cannot go wrong buying this or any other GINSU knife set. Buy with confidence!!!
