Absolutely Loved Falling Into You
I absolutely loved this book.  All of the different emotions I felt while reading made it hard for me to put down.  I was sucked into the book from the first chapter and had a very hard time putting it down.  I really hope Jasinda writes a sequel so the story will continue.  I was heart broken when I reached the last page.  I didn't want to leave the lives of Nell and Colton.  You definitely need to have a box of kleenex handy when you read this book.
