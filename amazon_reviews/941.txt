I received this device as a birthday present. It produces a passable pot of coffee but there is nothing particularly outstanding about its basic functionality and the automatic brew function was unreliable. After two months of operation, the unit failed and would no longer brew coffee. It took Hamilton Beach six weeks to replace it after I provided photographic evidence that I had destroyed the power cord. The replacement unit has now also failed in the same exact manner, after four months of use. This item has been one of the worst appliances I've had the misfortune to own, and continues a trend of expensive equipment failures I have observed with this manufacturer.;
