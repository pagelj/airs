Not what I thought would be
I understand when buying used there will be some flaws, however, the first phone I received, the display didn't work. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me another. Upon receiving the second one, it turned on nicely after charging it over nite. During the activation it shut completely off and would not turn on. I took battery out for over a minute and tried again. It still wouldnt turn on. I used to sell cell phones, program and work on them. I appreciated the fact that they were willing to replace the second one but I did not appreciate the fact that I was treated like I did not know what I was talking about with the phones. They did issue a refund and am waiting on that.
