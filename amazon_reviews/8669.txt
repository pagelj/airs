Loving this purchase. No regrets.
After 2 weeks of having this camera, I can say without a doubt - no regrets. Yes, it was a bit pricey to shell out $3,500 all at once. But I've already taken about 2000 shots and I can see a difference. The new auto focus system is so fantastic, I'm able to grab focus quickly and refocus quickly if necessary. And, I know this is stupid, but - I love the way it sounds when I press the shutter. It has a very satisfying "click" - even my significant other commented on it. Another thing I love is the ergonomics. I feel like this camera is glued to my little hand - and yes, I have tiny feminine hands... and this big camera is just stuck in them! Canon really did their research when they modeled this camera - there is a nice little thumb notch carved out, and coupled with the grippy finish, all my fingers fall right into place the second I pick it up. My only criticisms: no on-board flash (it would be nice not to have to bring extra equipment with me if I'm just going to a birthday party...) and I'm not in love with the new location for the zoom button, however, I'm getting used to it.
