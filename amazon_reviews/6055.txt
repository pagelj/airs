Deal of the Century
The E-PL1 was a good value camera when it came out as the "light" companion to the EP-1, at around $500.  At $284, you should not be looking at point-and-shoots any longer.  It's the Deal of the Century.  If you're not a shutter guy, use the auto mode - and start cautiously exploring the world of Shutter- and Aperture-Priority, ISO numbers, F-Stops and exposure tricks.  It's digital, no wasted film ... the lens isn't tops, but even at F3.8 an M. Zuiko isn't going to give anything but a good picture.  Cheap enough for a nice gift.
