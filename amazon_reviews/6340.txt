Great resolution.  I like the color of the camera too.
I love Nikon cameras.  The D3200 with 24.2MP is perfect if you need to zoom and crop your pics.  The resolution holds up with little or no pixelation.  Camera is easy to use, a great bang for you dollar.  Amazon does a great job keeping these products affordable.  No way I could purchase with multiple lenses if I had to do it at retail costs.  This is why I shop Amazon.
