The coffee maker is OK, suits my needs.  Main complaints are voiced elsewhere:- can't see water level in indicator until it rises to around 4 cups;- LCD backlight is extremely bright in a dark room;- coffee temp could be a bit hotter, but OK for me. However, the biggest issue I had was with very slow pouring from the carafe.  I traced it to an apparent manufacturing process defect, easy enough to fix in case someone else runs into this issue:In the carafe cover there is a white soft rubber sealer that is supposed to rise when you press the pour lever.  In mine, it barely moved resulting in a slow trickle when pouring.  I pried apart the two halves of the cover (using a small slot blade screwdriver) and found that a small retaining ring buldge in the stem of the rubber seal had not been seated properly on the plastic lever when it was manufactured.  By pulling the stem through the mounting hole in the lever, the buldge snapped into the correct position.  Now the rubber seal lifts properly and the carafe pours fine. A few more geeky hacks:* I velcro'ed a small keychain LED light in the water compartment (above max water line) so when I fill it on a dark morning I can see the water line: Press the LED light button while pouring ;-)* Put a black electrical tape flap over the super-bright LCD, as suggested by another poster.
