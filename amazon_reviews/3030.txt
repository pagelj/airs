Nice cord
I love the longer cables for home use. I've bought quite because my kids break the wires in the end that plugs into the ipod or phone. The added length seems to alleviate this issue somewhat. This cable has held up better and longer than even my oem one. It does feel a little rough going into my phone but works fine.
