hooked.. and wanting more.
Wool was recommend to me by my husband - as he knows I love apocalyptic, sci-fi kinda stuff. It was a rough start, but I ended up hooked. And I haven't been able to stop since I started, and now I've finished the shifts and I'm wanting more. I'm left with this appetite and damn if I know I'm going to end up reading everything else Howey has written till there's more about the silos. Thanks Hugh, you done good.
