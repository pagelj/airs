Zen master
Scott Kelby is the master when you have anything Photoshop or lightroom related. This is the only guy I trust and what I like about his books is that he gets straight to the point and doenst BS you. Other instructors explain every little detail in photoshop with things you will never actually use but this guy doesnt. Highly recommend this and any of his books.
