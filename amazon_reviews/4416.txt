Happy I bouught this camera
I was in the market for a point and shoot camera to take on my recent trip to Florida. I didn't want to carry my big SLR camera around Disney World as I have done in the past. After researching and reading reviews I decided on the Canon Powershot SX260 HS. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. My seven year old granddaughter was even able to use the camera with ease. I can't say enough about the 20X zoom.......... FANTASTIC! I love the different shooting modes. I was able to get great fireworks shots at Disney. The color and clarity of my printed pictures far exceeded my expectations. The only downside for me is this camera didn't come with a complete printed manual. It only comes with the getting started booklet. This camera has so many great features that I want to make use of all of them. I downloaded the manual CD and printed a copy. I find that easier than logging on to the computer when I want to read up on a particluar feature. All in all this is a great camera.
