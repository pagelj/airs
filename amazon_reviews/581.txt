As good as I hoped it would be
It doesn't replace all the functionality of my iPad, or all the functionality of my laptop (HP Win7), but it definitely compliments them.  I've also got an iPhone - and I get good use out of each of these four devices (iPad, chromebook, iPhone, and laptop) in different ways. Pros of the chromebook vs iPad:- Real web browsing (so easy to have multiple tabs open and switch between them)- Typing any kind of document is so much better - especially google docs.- Screen size is a bit larger.- Hulu and other flash only web-sites work. Pros of the iPad vs chromebook:- Better games on the iPad- Better selection of "apps"- Very functional offline- NetflixPros of the chromebook vs Laptop- lightweight - way more portable- startup/shutdown/sleep is way faster- touchpad is better for scrolling web-sites- quiet, no heat- battery life is betterPros of laptop vs chromebook- a "real" computer, can do it all- can remote control my work machine using RDC (chrome remote control is a no-no at my work)I think I'd rather have a Macbook Air than a chromebook.  But at 1/4 the cost - it was easy to justify buying this guy and it has been well worth it. I've enjoyed having it and am glad that I bought it.  I've owned it for a couple of months now and haven't had any issues so far.
