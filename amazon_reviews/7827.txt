Good product!!
This ia a good looking stand. Matches my MacBook Pro 17 perfectly. It does just what I wanted. It raises the display closer to eye level and has space underneath for my external keyboard. None of its possible limitations bother me. It is not adjustable, but the height is fine for me. It is just a little springy, but I type on an external keyboard and use a mouse. It would be nice if it had some sort of cord stowage or USB hub, but those are not at all deal breakers for me. I'm glad I bought it. So are my neck and shoulders.
