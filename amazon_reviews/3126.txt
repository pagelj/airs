Reminiscence
I haven't actually read Analog for about 20 years, but it was my introduction to science fiction very nearly 40 years ago, when I shared a flat (sorry, must use American, an appartment) in New York with one of John W. Campbell's editorial assitants!  Since then, the genre has provided education, solace, amusement - and some disdain from others - and I despair at how few really good new English SF writers there seem to be.  However, anyone (and I do mean anyone) who tries Analog with an open mind will find it a revelation.
