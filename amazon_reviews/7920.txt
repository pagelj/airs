WOOL 1
I received this Kindle book as a gift about 2 months ago. I do NOT know what kept me from reading it sooner!! I read this, the first installment of what is turning into a FANTASTIC series, over the course of a day. I could not help but fall for one of the main characters. My hopes for his success in finding what he truly needed and missed, and then feeling so... sad... when that character found what he'd been looking for, but not in the way that the character, or myself, had hoped. I have already recommended this book to many of my friends, and will continue to push this series to others. I am enamored with the characters, and being most of the way through the 2nd book I am finding that I will NOT be able to put these down, and know that I will want for more when the find word is read. Hugh Howey certainly knows how to capture an audience, build rapport between characters and readers, and, without a doubt, he knows how to keep us all on the edge our seat with every enchanting and enticing word. WOOL is a must read for everyone. Whether they be post-apocalyptic fans or not, the story in and of itself is well worth the read, and definitely worth more that the .99cents that it costs for this, the first of many, hopefully, wonderful tales.
