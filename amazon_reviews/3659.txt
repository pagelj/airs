roku rocks
I bought the Roku 3 a couple of months ago for my main TV.  I liked it so much, I wanted another Roku for the guest bedroom.  I opted for the LT version, as it's about half the price of the Roku 3 (and I got it as a gold box deal, so it was even cheaper than that), and it won't be used much so it doesn't need the extra features the Roku 3 has. Set up was super easy... it only takes a couple of minutes to connect everything, and it works right out of the box.  You can connect multiple units to your Roku account, and connecting to other accounts (amazon, hulu, netflix, etc.) is a breeze. The only complaint I have is minor... it is a bright purple color.  I think I would prefer black, as it would be less visible. But it's such a minor thing, I think it still deserves 5 stars.
