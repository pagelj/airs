Bye bye cable!!!
Ive literally had this little gadget for 1 day, and I love it. Its got free movies and tv, you can even use your smartphone to control it! Even my daughter, who was dead set against getting rid of cable,told me that she loved it. There is still lots that this can do, but if your on the fence about buying this, I would definately recommend it.
