Great bag, a little hard to get into easily
This bag has proven to be very durable for me; the construction is solid. What I don't like about it is probably a feature, not a bug -- the closing strap prongs snap REALLY WELL in to the receiver. This means that if you're trying to fish your camera out of the case for a shot, you better be filming something standing still, because you can't just flip the bag open with ease unless it's already open. There is enough storage capacity for one camera and 2-3 medium-sized lenses, with several filters able to be included in the various pouches. If you're using a larger lens, it may not fit in this bag with the camera at all, though if you play with the variable, adjustible velcro side panels inside the main compartment, you can get a surprising number of useful configurations. The padding is very nice inside the bag; I feel my camera is safe inside for travel.
