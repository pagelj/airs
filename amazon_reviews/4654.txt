Good Reliable Blu-Ray with integrated Internet Features
I am pleased with my Panasonic blu-ray player. All of the integrated internet features streamlined my set up. I was previously using a Roku 2 HD Streaming Player for streaming content and my Xbox 360 Arcade Console for DVDs. With a new wealth of releases on blu-ray and the jaw dropping visual enhancements, I am happy I made the upgrade. I don't care about the 3D capacity, and don't use it, so I can't comment on that. I agree with other reviewers that it loads blu-ray discs very quickly. The internet features do load very slowly and are clunky as others have noted. I don't think it's a really big issue, it just makes the player seem slow when you move the cursor right and it lags behind your choice. I enjoy the access to Amazon videos, Netflix, Pandora, and Youtube. Though they could add a few more channels, like a newscaster and a more accurate local weather program. Like a few others I had sound issues, with the sound on blu-ray discs being almost unintelligible, however, tinkering with the audio settings fixed mine. I have not experienced reported issues with Netflix. I stream from Netflix hassle free with excellent picture quality. The most irritating design flaw for me is that it will ONLY recognize photos from Micro SD cards. I store all my music on SD cards because I have a SanDisk Sansa Clip+ 8 GB MP3 Player (Black). You can access MP3's from a flash drive, but its an absurd and obvious oversight that you cannot access anything but photos from an SD card. I can transfer songs to a flash drive and access them on the player, however, its just irritating that I have to. Overall at the price point, with the units capacity and features, I am very pleased with my purchase and knowing all I know now, I would repurchase this item again.
