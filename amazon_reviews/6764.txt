Do not buy, horrible customer service from Samsung, but Amazon is the best
Bought for my wife for xmas, she had it for 2 weeks, had a critical error on the software, sent it back to samsung, they wanted to charge us $48.  Had them ship back to me, we sent back to amazon, they gave us a full credit and we bought a ASUS.  Hard to believe such a large company like Samsung would not warrantee thier own product.  I will never buy Samsung again and I suggest you dont either.  Keep in mind Amazon was awesome thru the whole process.  Always buy from Amazon!!!
