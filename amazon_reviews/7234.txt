works perfectly with my Mac
I bought this to use as a time machine for my Mac. Other hard drives already formatted for Mac are a lot more expensive, so I rolled the dice and bought this cheaper model that was formatted for Windows computers and I am glad that I did. I was easily able to erase the hard drive and format it for NTFS+ using Macs built in Disk Utility. I am now able to use this external hard drive as a time machine and I was also able to save some money!
