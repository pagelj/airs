My one-month experience with the Swerve
I want to write a small review (or at least I want to) about my experience using the Swerve. Note: Sorry if I don't express clearly with my english, I'll do my best. First, I was searching for a "very good" backpack, and cheap. My SwissGear messenger bag was not that good when I travel with laptop plus accesories and some notebooks, I always ended with shoulder pain. So I decided to return to "backpacks", which I have not used since high school. There were two backpacks which I was thinking over: the High Sierra Swerve and the Access . I count the Loop also, but because the price, features and the needs I had, I decided to go with the Swerve. I think Access is good, but because I live in Baja California, Mexico, there is no need to buy it for the rain cover because there are like 7-12 raining days in all the years, plus the design... I didn't like too much, looked to big IMO. And I was not wrong: the Swerve has satisfied all my needs. One day I put inside my laptop plus accesories (mouse, charger, moused pad), 4 german books (less than 200 pages each), 1 notebook, a brand new Uniden telephone that I bought in WalMart, my camera, my ipod + charger and some papers inside of folders, and well, they all fit inside and there is plenty of space free. No more shoulder/back pain, looks like the suspension system from the Swerve works. I would have liked to have this backpack during my college studies. I would give it 4.5 stars. The ONLY complain that I found with the Swerve (and a lot of people who bought it) it's the second-main zipper does not work properly. All the zippers work very good, but this zipper in particular get stuck and it is hard to close/open. I do not why, maybe because the length is big. I found solution when use it: the piece of fabric which cover all this zipper, just lift it (to the outside) and the zipper will work smoothly like all the zippers. Maybe the problem is this piece of fabric.
