Fantastic Griddler... use it all the time!
This is the best small appliance I have in my kitchen!! Since I received it, I have used it all the time. EASY EASY clean up, fanastic paninis, hamburgers, pancakes & waffles (I recommend getting the waffle plates too), and it doesn't take up a lot of space!! I read previous reviews complaining about "plastic clips that hold the plates in melting"... however, my Griddler came with metal clips so it appears that Cuisinart corrected their design flaw!! This Cuisinart Griddler is so useful I decided to get rid of 3 small appliances that were just taking up space: a flat griddle, a waffle iron and a George Foreman grill!!!.
