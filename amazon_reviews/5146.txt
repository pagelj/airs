We decided to spend some bonus dollars on one of our credit cards and had gotten a 16 pieces of this flatware. We like the feel and the weight so much we decided to get enough for a family meal and ordered the 45 peice set. It comes with a serving spoon, a slotted spoon, a serving fork and a relish spoon.
