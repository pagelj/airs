This toaster was great to start off with, but has a very flimsy "shelf" that brings the toast up and down. Once those bend the toaster's "toast." Can't stand buying a product that doesn't last. We used to have toasters for a decade or 2, now they last maybe a year or 2, this one even shorter. Don't buy it.
