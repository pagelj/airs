GOOD MAC, BUT NEEDS MORE ATA HARD DRIVE, RECOMMEND POWERBOOK
I got this iBook, and it is really awesome with all of the software, and I am really impressed with MAC OS X, but I ran into a little trouble with my 30 gb hard drive a couple days ago, so I had to get rid of all my music, and clean out junk to get more hard drive. I would recommend this to a web surfin' e-mail, basic type of guy, or a student. This notebook is not meant for pro's. I would recommend a PowerBook with more hard drive and DVD-R drive and airport extreme built-in, when an iBook you have to buy it separately (which is a whopping $100.00). The PowerBook eventually pays for itself.
