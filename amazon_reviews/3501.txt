It Works
This is a 2 review of this product. The first did not work well but the customer service is great. The seller offered to replace the item which was awesome. The price is great and the matte finish keeps finger prints from showing. The first bubbled but this did not. It adheres to the cell phone nicely. I would recommend this screen protector and will re-order another in the near future.
