This does the trick if you are looking for a very inexpensive coffee maker.  Its totally plastic however and on the one sent to me the top cover doesnt completely close.  That doesnt seem to affect the coffee but quite a lot of steam gets lost in the process.  For the price I cannot complain but I also suspect I will be replacing this in a year.
