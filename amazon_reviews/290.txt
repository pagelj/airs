Awesome Griddler!
We purchased this item for Christmas have used it numerous times already!  It is fantastic.  Sandwiches are low fat because you don't need butter to grill and you get that wonderful crispy texture on the outside with soft bread inside.  We just grilled salmon tonight and it was good, but 6 minutes (suggested time in owner book) is too long for us who prefer more underdone.  Best appliance we have bought in a long time.  Reminds me when microwaves first came out and after short time cooking with then, I couldn't believe how easy life could be.  How did we cook without them?  Quick and easy clean up.  Get this product.  You'll thank me.  I love it.
