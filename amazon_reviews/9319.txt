Best DVD player money can buy
I have owned the same DVD player for about 1.5 years. It recently broke and I chose to purchase the exact one. It is cheap, but I have to say well worth it. I have used it several hours per day and my kids watch German DVD's on it. The previous player I had was multi-region and there were no probelms. This one was only for US DVD's but with a little checking on the Amazon site, another member was very helpful with providing the instructions to get it working. I love this little player! If you are interested in a high quality all whisles-and-bells inclusive deal, this is probably NOT the one you want to purchase; if you are inerested in a cheap way of watching foreign DVD's, this is the way to go!
