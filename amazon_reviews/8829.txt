great android phone!
got mine a month ago. had it rooted to get rid of tmobile bloatware. runs on simple mobile $40 unlimited. battery life is great provided you know how to tweak the settings. am getting 2 days with heavy use and 3 days with normal use. display is amazing. wifi is quick to connect. camera/video is ok. internet browsing is blazing fast. overall no problems so buy this phone here at amazon.
