Great glass, junk construction
I use mostly canon L-series glass. I was thrilled with the performance of this lens-- super sharp-- but dismayed when the lens rolled off my pelican case and fell 7 inches *onto carpet* and broke clean in two. Ridiculous. I've handled a earlier version (with a metal) mount that felt far more robust.
