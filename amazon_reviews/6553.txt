DVD Recorder
This is the second Toshiba DVD Recorder I've purchased. This one is extremely easy to use and tapes as well as plays wonderfully. The only drawback is that if you run a satellite receiver through this machine, it has to be on all the time or you can't watch any regular television programs !!
