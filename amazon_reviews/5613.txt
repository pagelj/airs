Great book
I don't usually go for science fiction but with this series I couldn't put the books down. I ended up ordering the whole series because I really wanted to know what happened to the characters. I have 2 more books to go in the series and I'm hoping to find out what happened to Bean, Petra and thier kids by the end of it, but I don't think any of the books are going to cover it!!!
