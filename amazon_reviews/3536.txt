Pretty!
I love the bag! It does have nice pockets and dividing compartments, though I'm not too keen on the texture of the straps. I was also hoping to fit my 3-inch binder in there but it's too tall for it, I thought the bag was bigger than it is. Although there is still plenty of room when I fit my notebooks and accessories in there. I like it and I do recommend it! And there is a slight odor as one reviewer said, but it does not bother me.
