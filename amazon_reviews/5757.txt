Yongnuo YN-560-II
Overall seems to be excellent value for the cost though I have not had it long enough to comment on long term use nor used it enough to determine its consistency and accuracy of output & color balance & longevity. PRO:The external fit and finish of the item is very very good. All features work well. Power setting is very easy! Has a PC trigger connection. Metal foot can be held securely by the squeeze-type cold foot prevelant on umbrella tilts. I do not worry about deforming it like I do with a plastic foot. CON:LED's on the rear are somewhat too bright. No lockout for the -7 degree head tilt (no big deal - it won't be used on-camera)LED/Test button is difficult to depress - both too stiff and depresses too far towards the main body. Lacks a miniplug trigger connection. It did take me a bit to figure out that the sound will not work if I manually trip it - it has to be fired by another flash or through the PC connection! So there I sat reading and rereading the manual and familarizing myself with the flash and testing its features and thinking "Oh well sound is not really needed anyway...". But It does work; just not with the test button! I was pleased enough with the quality and features that I am retiring my Vivitar 285's and ordering another unit...
