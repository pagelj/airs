Console of a generation!!
This console is ahead of its time. It is more than just a video game console, it is an entertainment platform. In one console for $200, you can play video games, watch Netflix, connect with friends via social media, watch movies, and so much more. What else can you want out of it? Its a system that everyone in the family can enjoy. This shows where gaming is headed, and that is much more than just games. Online play on XB360 is the best. I own all three consoles and the Xbox 360 is the most polished of the 3.
