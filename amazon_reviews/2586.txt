Reverse display hinders functionality
I require a strong and durable watch for work, and no doubt G-Shock can take a beating and remain reliable. The features on this watch are great, especially the solar charge, and the fact that it receives a signal that will make it set itself. Time, tide, moon phase. Pretty sweet. Only thing I don't really like about this model is the black background instead of black numbers. When the light hits it right it looks cool and is quite visible, but in low light can be difficult to see. The green backlight works great, but when it isn't quite dark out and you need it anyway? I'd recommend a normal digital display. This one is just kind of a needless fashion approach.
