Great shots, just not as durable as I thought
The main reason I chose the f/1.4 over the f/1.8 was because of the more solid build.  I hate the feel of cheap, plasticky lenses so opted to pay a couple hundred extra dollars for something heavy duty. I had it for about one month before I dropped it less than 3 feet to the ground.  It landed on soft, almost shag-like carpet so I thought it wasn't a big deal.  I turned it on and it no longer would auto or manual focus.  When I give it a shake, you can hear tiny little broken pieces moving around.  It really was as soft as a drop could be and do not see how it could have messed it up that badly, but it did. It took amazing pictures and would be a great lens for someone who was not such a klutz.  That's just not me I guess.
