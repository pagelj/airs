Returning the Canon SX30IS
When I ordered the Canon SX30IS, what I really wanted was an SLR that could also take video. This camera does not well serve that goal. It's realy a point and shoot in the shape of an small SLR. For my large hands, it's too small to avoid activating some of the tiny buttons. But I could have lived with that. What I found unacceptable was the software. Unless you install the Canon program you can't get any images into a modern Apple computer. Upon installing it I found it a nightmare. It's almost impossible to get an image file into iPhoto or iMovie. If you use an Apple, forget it. I sent it back to Amazon. com, and in their usual trustworthy and easy to work with fashion, gave me a full refund.
