Phenomenal sound for a great price!
This is one of the most flexible mini sound systems I've ever seen - and the sound is incredible for the size. I live in a 3-level townhouse and can hear this from every floor when it's near full blast. Ordering a second one for when I'm working in the garage, since it'll probably get covered in sawdust and paint spray. Before I got it, I was wondering about charge time and found that it charges in 1-1.5 hours. Came with a good enough charge to play with it right out of the box. I only have one small complaint - I wish it had come with a little padded case, even if that pushed the price up a couple of bucks. Not a deal breaker however... I'll just make a custom one. In the meantime, I'm using a soft-side padded lunchbox, which easily holds this, the wall adapter & cables, and has enough room for my ipod classic, ipod touch, apple wall & car chargers... all in a pretty small package. If you're still on the fence about this product, take a leap of faith and order one. I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.
