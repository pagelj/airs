worth buying!!
If you were fortunate enough to get this book for free you are doubly blessed; saving money but also, more importantly, being introduced to a terrific author.  Not only have I read this book, but I've read the series to date, as well as other titles by this author.  I cannot express my pleasure at reading an entertaining story, well plotted, with wonderfully drawn characters, and most of all NONE of the amateur spelling and grammar errors so often found in "freebies".  I am re- reading this series (something I never do), and BUYING the latest release.  If you have never read this series... join me, you won't be disappointed.
