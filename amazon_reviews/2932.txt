Great Laptop but...
I absolutely love the look, fit, and finish of the ASUS VivoBook S550CA-DS51T.  It's pretty amazing that the overall thickness of this laptop is under an inch and yet it has a DVD R/RW drive. Battery life and the performance are on par per the price. The one thing I'm not crazy about is the operating system Windows 8. To me at least, Microsoft took a step back compared to Windows 7 only because its more complicated; not as familiar as the previous versions. I've read some of the low rated reviews that gives this laptop a bad wrap because of how complicated it is to navigate. It's not Asus's fault... blame Microsoft's Windows 8. Other than that, I'd definitely would recommend this laptop.
