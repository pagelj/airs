I always buy cables from Amazon brand because they always work as expected, and usually the cheapest out there. Plus, why not buy from the brand that you buy everything else from on the web, am I right? Plus, with Prime 2-day shipping free because I'm a college student is a double plus. They should have paid me for free advertisement but whatever. Good, working cable haha.
