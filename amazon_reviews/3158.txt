Dead on arrival
The unit arrived yesterday and the setup screen will not appear, so I can't set it up for use. I called tech support and got no help. I have a Magnavox DVR/DVD player that's worked fine for a couple years now, but apparently their quality control people dropped the ball on this cheap VCR. Also, all the labels on the unit itself and the remote control are small and hard to read. I'm going to try another brand.
