Does what it should
I bought this after our old portable DVD player started to malfunction.  This product has been good for trips, listening, and watching at home.  As with most portable DVD players, the sound could be better (louder for sure) but it isn't a deal breaker.  It does what it should.  Play DVD's and CD's.  I would recommend it - esp. the 9" size, our old one was 7" and it seems to be a big difference.
