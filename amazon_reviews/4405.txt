Didn't work well for my PS3.
I always buy ultra-cheap HDMI cables from Amazon or Monoprice, and have never had problems before. This particle product was loose-fitting in both the PS3 and TV ports, and when I turned on the PS3, the video would judder every few seconds. By judder, I mean flashes of black would temporarily cover the screen. I will continue to buy cheap cables, but not this brand...
