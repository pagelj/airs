Cheetah a winner
The Cheetah Mount is just as advertised at a fair price.  Took about 30 minutes to install, we used our own large level as suggested by others.  This was just what we needed for our 52 inch LCD flat screen, allows us to pivot our tv when we have company, pull the unit out from the wall to get behind the tv, and lets us tilt the tv for best viewing.  We are very pleased with the mount system!!
