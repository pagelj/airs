I love this radio
After the great Eastern Derecho storm I wanted an emergency radio so I could at least know what was happening while I crouched terrified in my basement.  I have not tried all of the bells and whistles on this but can attest that it charged quickly through the USB cable.  I will use this mostly in my garden.  At maximum volume I could place it in the middle of a 15 by 25 foot garden bed and hear it clearly all around the area. It remained charged in the sunlight for the couple of hours I was working. This will make weeding less tedious.
