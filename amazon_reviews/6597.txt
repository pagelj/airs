Victorinox Chef's Knife
This is the best Chef's knife that I have ever owned.  It sharp to the point that you need to be very careful not to cut your self without even knowing that you have done so.  Don't ask how I know, but I still have 10 fingers.  Not only is this a sharp knife, but it holds an edge for a very long time.  Unlike more expensive knives I have owned. It makes short work of chopping and dicing.  I liked this knife so well that I purchased one as a giftand will probably buy more.
