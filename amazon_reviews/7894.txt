Good product for the price.
When retail stores charge way more than this, then right away you learn how good this bracket is. It's a little hard following their illustrations, hence one star missing from top rating. I had the challenge of affixing these to metal studs, but sharp drills got me the correct size hole and thus the lad bolt screws went in securely hold the my 32 inch screen.
