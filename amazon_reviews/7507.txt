Pleased
I bought this stand for my computer. I have a 13in computer, and it works flawlessly. I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. It's stable. It seems durable. The only thing I noticed that may be off is the level. One side appears to be just a taaaddddd bit higher than the other, or maybe it's just me. Regardless, this is a great purchase. If you're looking to save some space by slipping the bottom legs underneath a mixer or something, that won't be happening because it's not designed for that (just look at how the bottom too legs are made). In summary, this is a great stand and i love it.
