very good
What a surprise. I had never heard of this author and when I saw this appealing cover, it made me want to see what the story was about.  I loved it so much, I bought the trilogy with this story in it, and Jinni's Wish!  I am waiting for the rest of the stories in the series to come out and will definitely buy.  This was a surprise because it was a FREE download.  Nice.
