First thing to know.  When I received I put toast in right away.  Apparently not a good idea.  It had a plastic chemical smell that was literally smoking.  I immediately took the bread out and toasted on dark for about three times before it finally went away. Apart from that it looks nice, seems to be toasting well and is basically a cheap nice looking toaster.  I am not a toast snob and unless toast suddenly becomes burned for no reason, I'm generally pretty easy going with a toaster as long as it works.  This one seems to work... just have to get rid of that horrible burn off.***UPDATE 2013.04.24***/After using this for a while, I'm over the chemical/rubber burning smell and I'm bumping to four stars.  It's a basic toaster, it toasts based on time and will make your toast crunchy.  It looks nice and it's been working well.  Originally I had at three stars but I think it deserves four and possibly five based on bang for the buck price.  If you're looking for a simple cheap toaster, I've been happy with it. AS for the burn off, I toasted it empty three times and it seemed to have faded away by then.  It hasn't returned.
