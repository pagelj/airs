Please read this!
Sweet, funny, heartbreaking, wonderful, beautiful.... these are just a few of the words I would use to describe this book. I cannot begin to tell you just how wonderful this book is. There are no words to describe the beauty of Nell, Kyle and Colton. The love they each share is nothing short of amazing! Read this book with a big box of tissues, you will need every one. This is one of those books that will touch your soul and never leave your heart!
