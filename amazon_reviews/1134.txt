Great player for a great price.  Get and SD Card if you don't have one already.
My parents had previously purchased two bargain priced Vizio Blu-Ray players, which turned out to be surprisingly bad.  Netflix was constantly buffering, Hulu was basically unusable (My Wi-Fi puts out 15-35mbps), and they began to malfunction and lock up while playing Blu-Ray movies after just a couple of months. I did a little bit of research and decided to buy this Panasonic for them to replace one of their Vizios for Christmas.  After hearing a lot of complaining about their new movies not working, I decided to give it to them early.  They have been using it for about a month now without a single hiccup. The first thing we did with it was activate Netflix and Hulu.  This player allows you to Log In to both Apps by entering in your Username and Password, unlike most devices, which will give you an Activation Code which must then be entered in after logging into your account from a PC. This player has a Motion Sensor above the Disc Tray that allows you to simply wave your hand over it to insert a disc, which is quite convenient under certain circumstances.  As to be expected, all Blu-Rays put into this player have played flawlessly. This player has exceptional Wi-Fi.  Everything on Netflix and Hulu plays at the highest quality with absolutely no lockups.  There are also plenty of Apps built in, including Facebook. Overall, this is one of the best values out there for anyone that wants a good Standalone Blu-Ray Player that won't break your wallet.  My parents loved it so much that they bought a second one for their bedroom.  The only reason I didn't give it Five Stars is because there is no Memory built in and no SD Card included.  If you are new to Blu-Ray, you should know that Firmware Updates and Partial Installs are REQUIRED for MOST Blu-Ray Movies.  In other words, unless you have an SD Card to pop into this thing right from the start, you will not be watching any Blu-Rays.
