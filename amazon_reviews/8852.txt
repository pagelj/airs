KILLER!
Talk about a book being worth the money.  Both this and the 2nd, ZERO RECALL, and THE MOLDY DEAD are just great books.  Worth the cash, and fantastic reads. I have to thank the author for such a great story.  If ever a story I've read here deserved praise it's the three above.  I've read hundreds of science fiction books.  These easily rate at the top.
