SO ANNOYED!
I bought this monitor at buy buy baby and it did not hold a charge so I brought it back and they graciously replaced it for me. I have had the replacement for just under a year and the power cord to the video display became frayed at the end that plugs into the wall.  I called Motorola and they said you can't buy one so the only way that I can get one is if I have a warranty.  I cannot find my warranty information so now I am just out of luck.  I purchased a $250 baby monitor and cannot replace the power adapter because they do not sell it and I cannot find the correct voltage and mA adapter ANYWHERE!  Motorola said to go to Radio shack or Staples, I have been to multiple locations and they do not have the correct voltage/mA match.  In addition it was extremely difficult to find a head that would fit into the small power hole on the charger. I called Motorola back and threw a fit so they agreed to give me one for free.  Very nice except it takes 5 days for them to process their order and then they ground ship it... My daughter already climbed out of her crib and fell because I could not supervise her with the monitor... SO ANGRY!  Now it has been 8 business days (11 days since I called if you include weekends) and they said, "oh we are behind and have not processed your shipment yet".  AGAIN I offered to pay for the charger, pay over night shipping, whatever it would take to get it in the next day so I can stop worrying about my daughter falling out of the crib again.  NOPE cannot do it... I don't understand how a company can sell a product and not be able to sell you nor send you somewhere to purchase an adaptable power cord.  RIDICULOUS! The monitor is fantastic when it is working, much better than my old Summer.  However if you purchase this do not lose nor damage your power cord as you cannot get a replacement and will have to buy an entire new unit. So annoyed!
