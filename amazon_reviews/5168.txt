Dependable
First tip: read the instructions before you try anything, I wasted one of the protectors not doing this. I've had it on for a few days now and I have no complaints at all. The screen is clear, I feel protected with it on and it doesn't bubble easy, just make sure you clear all dust from the screen before application. Overall, insane value for money. Don't look further. You won't get a better deal.
