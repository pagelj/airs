Lots of Action!
Wired is a fast paced thriller from start to finish.  It's got a bit of science fiction thrown in with the genetic manipulation creating super intelligence.  Sure wish it wasn't fiction, I could use something like that! The characters were ok.  Desh and Kira were likeable, though maybe not 100% believable as real people.  Kira seemed a little too good at the action stuff for a scientist.  Desh did have a soft side to counteract his tough soldier qualities. The story was written well and paced just right.  It kept my attention throughout, and I think it will keep yours.*Disclaimer:  I received this book for review from the author through LibraryThing.  I was not required to write a positive review.
