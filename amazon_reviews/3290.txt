Mine
Pretending he's mineIt started as a game that should of gotten them everything they wanted. Instead they got everything they never expected. It was a great read and like her other book fun and easy. It has what a romance needs to keep you wanting to turn that page. (or swipe)Reeve was the perfect man. I love how paid attention and didn't keep his feelings bottled up. I would love to meet a man like him. He was hot, confident and sexy. And OH MY GOD the theater seen....... Yes he is good. He was also good in the wine cellar. Don't worry I didn't give anything away..... Sutton was great too.. she knew what she wanted and would do what ever it took to get it. She is not big on mushy and tends to not speak her mind when it comes to feelings but Reeve likes a challenge. She loves her job and her dog and never wanted to think pass that until she was where she wanted to be career wise. But life has away of happening even when your not looking. Together I thought they were energetic. They knew how to keep each other on their toes and at the same time have fun. Reeve really knew how to get in her head. If you're looking for a quick fun read this book is for you.
