Great start to the series!
This was a great start to the typist series! As I was reading the story, I was getting more and more drawn into the complex character of Smith. I couldn't get enough of him. I wanted to be inside his head. He was the typical dominant alpha male but as I was reading, I sensed that there was something deeper inside but couldn't or wouldn't come out. The sex scenes, oh my goodness, were hott!! It was getting intense for me as I was reading and I couldn't get enough! Tori was the perfect contrast to Smith and they seemed to complement each other. I wasn't sure I was going to like this series because of the "bad boy" nature of Smith but that is what kept drawing me into the story and I wanted to read more. Interested to read the rest of the series! Great start!
