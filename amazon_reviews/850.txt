Durable, simple style, useful
Believe the hype, this bag is great!  I used it for an extensive and busy trip to Japan and Indonesia this winter.  This is the perfect bag to carry with you at all times. The Small size is perfect... it's small enough to tuck away underneath the seat in the plane, but big enough to carry so much.  It's also not too big so it doesn't strain your shoulders for long days with this on! I bicycled and rode motorcycles while in Indonesia, but the cross-strap did an amazing job at keeping the bag still.  The quick adjuster for the shoulder strap works very nice, too. Inside, I found myself finding out there were more compartments while on the trip! The zippered parts were a good place to hold important things, like travel insurance form, copy of passport, etc. I love this bag.  Seriously.  Get one if you're thinking about it, but don't get the all black because that's what I got... we'd be bag twins if we bumped into each other on the street.
