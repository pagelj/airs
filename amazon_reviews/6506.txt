Not Whole Grain...!
Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain... The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour... not whole grain! That is the 5th item listed and only provides 1 gram of fiber... Many companies are on the band wagon portraying their products as whole grain goodness and this is because the FDA has not come up with guide lines for whole grains...!
