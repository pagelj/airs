Maybe I got a bad one
I purchased this for Christmas and didn't actually turn it on for several months so I can't return it.  The picture and sound quality are fine, it just doesn't play continuously.  On DVD's that other players have no trouble with it continually hangs.  Most of the time, it starts up again in a few seconds but I can't get through a 30 minute exercise DVD without it hanging at least 10 times, 4 of which require me to tap the player to get the disk to start up again.  If I had the opportunity, I would return this for my money back and try a different one.
