It's perfect... Just what I expected!
It's amazing! I really love this phone. It has a large internal memory (4GB), I'm tired of installing applications and I'm still with space. It has a screen with the appropriate size, 16 million colors (like a computer!). Great speed on Internet. Initially turned off and cycled for itself, which worried me a bit, but then, after 3 weeks or so, the firmware was updated for itself and stopped having this problem. It looks very nice (white color looks fantastic). Honestly I'm happy with my purchase. Very different from my previous phone (Samsung Galaxy Ace, less memory, not so wonderful colors, but that was my first smartphone, and I have much affection yet). Excellent communication with seller and shipping was as fast as had been agreed. Just buy it, is great.
