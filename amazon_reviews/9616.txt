Wow: Thanks Amazon
Mesh jacket on outershell, well constructed, snug fit and seems really durable yet flexible enough to move around the corners. You can really feel the quality by holding it along with the wt it carries. Love it .. I am not using the ethernet part but since I was buying one thought will "try to" future proof my investment by adding few dollars. Happy to answer any questions, if anyregardsPBG
