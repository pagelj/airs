received this vacuum for Christmas.  Literally, love at first sweep.  It's the best vacuum in the world...... but only if you like vacuums lasting for a few months. Received it in December, died in April. It still turns on, but won't suck anything up, and the brush no longer works.  I went to the vacuum repair shop since it's under warranty, and they said that this happens with the Linx a lot, they get a lot of complaints.  Hoover actually told me the main issue w/ this model is the on/off switch breaking. The vacuum shop told me it was a mistake to purchase this.  So far, I agree.  I'm going to see if Amazon will let me return it and purchase the Cirrus that I heard was better.
