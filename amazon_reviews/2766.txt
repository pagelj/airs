We really like this coffeemaker.  The thermal carafe keeps coffee fresh longer--because it has no heating pad at the bottom to burn the coffee. Some reviews said that you must be careful to get the top screwed on properly, and that's true.  That requires a bit of trial and error.  To do that, I turn the top backwards (as if unscrewing it) until (1) the word "Close" is near the spout and (2) I feel the top "seat" --settle into place.  Then I turn the top the other way to secure it. If you have it right, the last little bit will require some extra pressure to finish the job -- and the word "Pour" will be next to the spout.
