This is a quintessential toaster from a reliable company. It is nothing much to look at, but given the price, there is nothing to complain about. In goes bread, out comes a toast, - simple and stupid. Just the way I like my breakfast, uncomplicated. Reviewers complaining about their toasters breaking after 2 years of every day use, should understand that these household products are designed to break after 2-3 years of use. They design dishwashers to break after 5-7 year now. The proverbial grandmothers and aunts whose toasters worked for 20-40 years without a glitch did not pay $30-50 in todays money for them. I bet that toaster cost $30 then, which comes to about $300 in our money. There are toasters on the market currently in this price category and they are most probably more prone to last 20 years. I, for one, do not care to pay so much for a piece of equipment built to perform a very simple task of warming my bread , if I have to replace it every other year, so be it. You generally get what you pay for. Keep your receipts - it does come with 3! years warranty, by the way!
