This vacuum rocks!!! I do have 2 complaints. 1- the hose isnt really long enough, and it sucks so hard (in a good way) that it makes the hose contract some when youre using it. 2-the bin fills up quickly. HOWEVER, I assume thats a feature you gotta deal with from a vacuum with such great suction. Either the bin needs to be smaller, logistically. Or it fills up quickly because its sucking so much up and we havent had a GOOD vacuum in a while so theres lots of stuff lingering in our carpets. Im not sure what the deal is but Ill take it. Easy to put together, that went quickly. I dont usually appreciate a retractable cord/plug, but this one is actually kinda nice. Its easy to use with the foot pedal and yellow and red marks on the cord to let you know when its almost fully extended. Its not been as AMAAAAZING on hard floors as I would have expected after reading some of the reviews BUT it does do much better than any other vacuum ive tried to use on a hard floor. So, while I would have taken a star away for the few negatives, the AMAZING suction really makes up for those few flaws. Im very happy and if any thing happens in the future to alter my opinion of this product ill definitely come back and update my review.
