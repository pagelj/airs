sounds good on paper but be aware
I read these reviews and they all sound good but my experience has been very bad. The batteries for the phone don't take charge and I can't replace them with regular batteries. The handsets do not do their job of recharging the batteries so basically this phone is paper weight. out of the 5 sets I bought, only 2 work and not properly. I live abroad and bought these as an office intercom but they are useless.
