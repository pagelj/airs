quick & easy
It's inexpensive, but its not cheap. decently thick steel construction and easy assembly, i was very impressed for the cost at how well this thing is built and it includes litteraly everything you would need minus a drill-bit. instructions are overly wordy, as most are, but if you have any common sense assembly and mounting will be a piece of cake.
