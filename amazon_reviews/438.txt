Excellent Read
I ordered this book on a whim because someone said he sounded a bit like Heinlein. When I started reading it I was extremely impressed and just couldn't put it down. I finished it in two days then had to run to Borders to see if I could get the two sequals "The Ghost Brigade" & "The Lost Colony" - I finished each of them in one day a piece. I highly recommend this author if you love sci fi that makes you think, like if you're a fan Heinlein. Order it, you will not regret this purchase.
