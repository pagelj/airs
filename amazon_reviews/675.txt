One truly infuriating feature
I like this phone for everything except 2 things: making phone calls, and keeping time.  That's right, it sucks for phone calls.  Why?  Because it has that really infuriating feature all touchscreen phones have, only worse -- it automatically locks the screen within seconds.  Yes, it can be unlocked, but it locks again within seconds.  Over and over.  And you can't turn off the feature.  Imagine making a call to any business with an automated response interactive system, and you keep having to unlock it, press the dial pad icon, then press the number for a response, all within seconds.  Now imagine having to do that while trying to be handsfree.  I don't care what the overreactive, irrational justification (a solution in search of a problem) was for this feature, not being able to turn it off is unacceptably to-the-bone-marrow stupid.  The other boneheaded feature of Tracfone's software is that the world clock is wrong.  And can't be corrected.  It shows my area, Washington, DC, as being an hour behind New York City.  I mean, is this phone a microcosm of the intellect of today's world or what?
