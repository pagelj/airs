HDMI JACKPOT
I did not want to spend a ton of money on an hdmi cable so i took a chance on this inexpensive cable. I was not dissappointed with this purchase at all. The cable seemed to be well made and the connectors were quite sturdy. The picture on my 30" hd crt tv seemed to improve quite a bit. Shipping was fast and as usual amazon came thru again...
