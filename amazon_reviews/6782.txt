Works as advertised!
Sits a bit off the wall, but that is expected since it is not a slim profile setup.  The extra spacing is actually perfect for cable feed throughs if you are doing a wire drop behind the wall.  Wall anchors are provided as well as an assortment of screws to fit virtually any TV.  Also comes with a bonus HDMI cable and magnetic bubble level.
