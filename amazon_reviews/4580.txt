Best router I've ever owned
I don't doubt that there may have been firmware issues with the initial release of this product but in it's current state this router is absolutely fantastic.  The range and set of features is great and setup was a breeze.  It's stability is fantastic, I've had this router up and running now for over 4 weeks without a single restart. I am using this router in conjunction with Merlin's firmware which expands on the base models features with useful software such as OpenVPN. Great product and worth every penny.
