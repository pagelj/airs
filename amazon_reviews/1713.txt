Broke after about a week of light use
I bought 2 of these. One still works fine, the other broke after about a week of light use. If you are just going to plug it in and leave it on your desk, it's not a bad option given the price. But if you plan to keep it in a bag, in your glovebox, or carry it around with you, I would buy a proper one from Apple. This is is made of very breakable, brittle plastic, held together with cheap glue.
