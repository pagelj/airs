Just got my new LG combo unit and loving it.  We had to replace and relocate our existing laundry area, so rather than buy two units that take up space, and run all new ductwork for a dryer, we bought this.  I was skeptical at first, but I am really loving it!  The machine is full size, ample for my family of 4.  It cleans very well and is super quiet compared to my old Whirlpool.  Pros: Saves space, easy installation, energy efficient, you can have your clothes washed a dried for you when you arrive home from work.  Cons: You need to play with the dryer a bit to find the right amount of time needed; at first they feel wet, but it's mostly just steam-if you give it a minute to cool off they are dry.  Takes a long time. I will caution that I typically line dry my heavier items i. e. denim, sweaters, etc. So I typically pull them out before the dry cycle begins.  If you typically put all your clothes in the dryer, this may not be for you.
