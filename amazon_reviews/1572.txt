Not bad for being cheap.
You get what pay for here, really. I had bought this inverter mostly to charge my phone while streaming Internet radio while driving back and forth to work since the other car chargers I have bought from Walmart started spazzing out. I have to say that this item works really well for the price you pay for it. It's been almost two weeks since I've bought it, and so far so good. I did have a little trouble recently with the adapter coming loose, but nothing major. Again, with the price, it's really caveat emptor. If you can deal with the slight issues, this is the adapter for you. If you're impatient and easily frustrated, you may want to look for something else.
