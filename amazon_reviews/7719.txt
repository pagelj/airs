Great
This is a very nice backpack more tailored for school but it can also be used for travel. It is large enough for an overhead and very roomy inside and the fact that its whit it really makes a fashion statement. I only gave it three stars because I have not had an occasion to use it yet but I will be traveling to Florida in August and thought would be the perfect  opportunity to put it to the test and I think it will deserve more stars then.
