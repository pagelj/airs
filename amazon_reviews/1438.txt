great story, interesting world, good prospects for future stories
Great story in a believable dystopia and a lot more to come from the looks of how it ended. Like Vernor Vinge but underground. Technology/science is a steampunkish but that's ok - it isn't the focus of the action. I look forward to reading more in the series.
