Works well with my EOS Rebel T4i
Got this lens to go with my new EOS T4i, and have only very rarely used the 18-55 that it came with. It takes very good photos, makes for nice "Depth" perception effects, as I use it primarily on the lowest F-Stop I can put it on. I would have preferred a wider aperture, but for the price... (I got it on sale) I can't complain, as it does what I want very nicely. It is a little too "telephoto" for quick shots indoors of people, as the field of view [naturally] is pretty small. But that is what a telephoto zoom lens is for. One technical gripe I have is that the zoom ring is ever so slightly loose, giving a little play when I go to turn to adjust the zoom. Not really a big deal, but it is something I have noticed. Overall: Very pleased.
