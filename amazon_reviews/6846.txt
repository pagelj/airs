Great German Quality
Just received this vac today. Unboxed it and found assembly beyond simple, very good fit n finish. Motor is quiet and unit veryLight weight. I also ordered the floor brush for about 70 bucks and like it better than the head included. In the process ofGetting rid of carpet but have a little left and was curious if the air powered turbo head would work n this vac? One minor gripIs the nylon bristles on the small round dust brush, but at this price point horse hair would be too expensive. I do plan to adapt theOld electrolux horse hair brushes I already own. Opening too small so need adapter. This vac with floor brush is outstanding at laying flat on floor and getting under beds and very low chairs and such. I ordered next day but it took two days because it was shipped thru fedx instead of UPS, same order I had the floor brush and it shipped ups and was truly next day.
