Warranty worthless
Made good waffles, but when the adjustment knob fell off for no apparent reason and no way to repair it myself, I called Cuisinart and they said they would sent me another one for  $[...] and I would have to send the other one back and pay shipping. Might as well buy another maker from another manufacturer who stands behind their product and, probably, lasts a lot longer. So I cannot recommend this iron since I am sure there are others out there which would be more reliable and do just as good a job.
