Small and perfect for the RV
Not one to write reviews, ever, yet this little mighty oven has me doing just what I thought I would not do. Perfect size for my kitchen in the motorhome.  Would have loved to get the 850, but way to big.  This oven cooks fantastic toast, weird that it is better, yet it is.  I have baked several side dishes and it has done a good job.  In the motorhome we have no oven.  We have a convection, microwave combo.  The Breville 450 will be used more than the combo oven.  I can use it to broil, bake and toast.  I put my plates on the top and use it as a plate warmer, as it does get HOT.  So far I am extremely happy with this.  Don't hesitate, it is well worth it.
