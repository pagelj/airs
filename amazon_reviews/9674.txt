Perfect for my big old puppy
My golden retriever loves to go on hikes with me. now that i have 2 dogs 1 7 months and 1 large 12 year old its really hard to get everything in one bag. So this back pack is perfect. The big guy "buddy can carry little jack's water too. The pack is really easy to put on and take off. i put my phone and key and waste bags in the side pockets. The orange color really looks good on buddy too.
