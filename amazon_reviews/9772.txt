Excellent quality
This is the fourth in the Panasonic LX series and it is the best.  The port for the add-on electronic viewfinder makes this camera very pleasant to use. The latest edition of the add-on finder is vastly superior to the one which fits the LX5.  The lens is fast (f1.4 - f 2.3)  and the images are sharp.  This is a great everyday or travel camera.
