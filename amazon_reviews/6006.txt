Hallelujah!  Truly Bubble Free!
FINALLY!!!!!  A screen protector that is easy to attach and doesn't cause the user to have a nervous breakdown trying to get rid of all of those bubbles. The screen protector I had for my Kindle before was OK - using all of the tricks I found online (go into a steamy bathroom and clean the screen like mad before applying, etc.)- I was down to 3 bubbles.  Still - they drove me nuts! This protector was easy to install, bubble free, still works great with the touch screen... all good things. I just couldn't be happier with this product.
