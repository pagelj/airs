This is good camera for me.
Why I bought this camera?1. I was using Canon IXUS 40 which was bought at 2004, so I would like deprecate it and replace it with a newer compact camera.2. I have Canon hard disk camcorder which I bought in 2008, but it is too heavy so that I don't like to bring it with me during travelling. Since the technology of camera improves quickly, I would like to have a compact camera with good video recording feature.3. I read reviews from [...] and found XZ-1 is marked as Golden Award. Comparing with other Gloden Award cameras, XZ-1 has relatively low price.4. I don't have any professional knowledge of photography and don't have experience using any type of SLR camera, so I ignored some negative reviews published by DSLR users complaining the image quality by comparing with DSLR camera. Based on above background,  I bought this camera 2 two months ago. After using it several times, I am satisfied very much for the features of this camera. In almost all aspects, this camera is much more better than my old canon IXUS 40. But in video recording area. it is below my expectation. it totally cannot compete with my old Canon hard disk camcorder in multiple ares: definition is bad. video looks blur. speed of focusing is low so that when you move the lens towards items in different distance, this camera will spend 3-5 seconds to focus, which ends up with the recorded video is always very blur. One another minor issue is that only photo/video preview feature is available once plugging in USB cable for charging. I have a external USB battery for my cell phone,  so I thought this camera could also take benefit once out of battery during photographing . But currently once I plug in the USB cable, all other features will be shut down until I remove the cable. So, if encountering out of battery during visiting specific tourism attraction, External USB battery doesn't help much. Above all,  I rated four stars for this camera.
