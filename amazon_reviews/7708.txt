Just the right size
I brought this toaster oven because the Black and Decker I had for over 20 years just die. I first brought a Oster from Sam' s club because it was cheap. However, it was a little too big and most of all the numbers and letters by the dials were slowly erasing within one month. I returned the Oster and decided to buy a Black and Decker. The ones at the departments stores were either too small or too expensive. This one from Amazon was about 40% cheaper then the ones in the departments stores and only cost 5 dollars more the Oster. Oh, yes, no shipping cost either. When I received the toaster oven, it was pack in a very sturdy box and well package with bubble wrap. It has easy directions to follow and straight forward steps to operate. It comes with a decent tray that work well with the toaster oven and unlike the Oster the number and letters are not just paint on, so I doubt it will erase. The back is curved so you can fit a medium size pizza without any problems. However,  its still small enough that it doesn't take a lot of counter space, just the right size. I use my toaster oven mostly to toast bread and bagel, but the oven bakes well small food like a small chicken or a small lasagne platter. My only complaint so far is that it doesn't toast evenly no matter where I place my bread or bagel. This Black and Decker does the trick and deliver everything it says  except the uneven toast. This is the reason why I gave it a four star. But with everything else I can live with it.
