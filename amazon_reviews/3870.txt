Amazing!
When I start reading Hyperion 2 years ago, I couldn't finish the first 50 pages, but my friend told me to read it to the end, and I'm glad he did. This book is not easy to read but "good things come to those who  wait", and the result is a marvelous combination between a sci-fi  novel and mystic concepts. Just Amazing.
