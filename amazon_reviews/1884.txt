... i've used plenty of vacuums in my life and never had any luck with the stick types. But this one works great!  It's got great suction on the wood and tile / stone floors.  The carpet attachment works as well as any large upright. The light weight and compactness is what I was looking for.  The only 'odd' part of this vacuum is where the cord wraps behind the handle, but it is not a problem.  It's not too noisy and is easy to hang on a hook.  But best of all, it has great suction!
