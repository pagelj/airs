AMAZING!
I just finished re-reading MOA. I loved it the first time, but there are things that bothered me the second time. Don't get me wrong, it was a beautimous book. I ADORE this book. I have two copies of it and will lend out neither. But still, there were some issues. First of all, I can't stand Piper. I think Leo summed it up pretty good in the demigod diaries: Piper is half Cherokee, half Greek goddess, and Leo wasn't sure which one she was more sensitive about. And she obsesses waaaay too much over Jason, so much that I feel like all we know about her is that she is Jason's girlfriend. And Percy! We had so many block-buster thoughts from him in the last book, so maybe he was just a bit burnt-out. Maybe his lack of insight was intentional. I was still kind of disappointed there. But Annabeth and Leo's POV's were spot-on. We know them a lot better. Maybe a POV from Frank or Hazel would have been helpful, since they seemed kind of absorbed in their love triangle, but I would not have traded Annabeth's POV for the world. She is the one I am most hoping to see in the next book, because I find it kind of cool to see her observing and thinking about this ridiculous person that is Percy, especially sinc ei read five books from his POV! All in all, it was definitely a great book. The little details were amazing, like the nod to the Hoover Dam joke (which nobody there could have understood but Percy). But really, people, no book is perfect. You do not have to slam it because it doesn't live up to your dreams. This was a middle book. The man (although a troll) has written nine other books for the Percy Jackson world, and should be cut some slack. And besides, if we know Annabeth, how much more can we REALLY learn? The same goes for Percy. Besides, what can be suspenseful about the calm before the storm? Anyway, I can't wait for The House of Hades in October!
