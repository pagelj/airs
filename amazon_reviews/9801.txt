Great Lens
I bought this lens but had to return it.  It was me and not the lens though.  The weight of the lens was too much for me.  But don't let that discourage anyone as it is a great lens.  The autofocus is on spot and all pictures are sharp and clear.  It seems to focus fast as opposed to the 18-200mm model. Also, I tested the lens fully extended (300mm) under low light conditions with the pop-up flash.  All the way extend there are no shadows cast. If you're going to buy one all-purpose lens, this is the one to have.
