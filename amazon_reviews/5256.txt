best laptop i ever had
I was a previous windows user and then I became a mac user and I had a complete apple ecosystem for a little over three years. I became an apple fan boy but once I actually used a Chrome book for a while i fell in love with it. I have a complete ecosystem of Google now. Some people complain about the chromebooks loss of functionality once its taken offline but for me it works. There are plenty off offline chrome apps and the Os is more mature now with file management and media access. People also complain about hard drive capacity but i just purchased a GB SD which solved my problem of 60GB of media ranging from music,pictures,documents and video. You don't have to worry about system maintenance or antivirus protection. The  Chrome Os updates are free of charge and automatic... the boot,sleep and wake time are seconds the battery life is on par with my previous Mac Book Pro. So i think its a good buy i love mine. I have one small gripe i think they could have made a better connector for power cable and port seems like it wont last long. But all in all I recommend this computer for anyone.
