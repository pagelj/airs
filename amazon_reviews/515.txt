As a FedEx Driver this thing is my Best Friend
Alright well after using just a battery/phone case for a long time I was still not happy that many days I was having to conserve my use towards the mid point of the day so the phone wouldn't die later. I like to use my phone for one activity or another pretty much all day. So I figured I'd just buy another battery/phone case combo and just switch cases at some point in the day. During my search for my next case/charger I came across this BEAST! For less than the price (I got a good deal) of a typical case/charger I could get this thing that charges SIX times as opposed to not even one full time with the case/charger I was using. So now I never have to worry about streaming music all day with the screen on while on high brightness, no worries about using the navigation with 3D view on or searching the internet/watching videos/playing games while on my break. The thing is definitely to big to be carrying comfortably in your pocket. For me though it's perfect, I can just throw it in my work bag and keep it with me all day in my truck, just sitting out. So this thing is great for people like me who just need it nearby. I usually plug it in when I know I'm going to be in a long stretch of work while just streaming music. Then when I need to get really hands on with the phone I just unplug it real quick. No sweat off my back. I love this thing.
