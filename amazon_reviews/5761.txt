Awesome Camera bag.
This bag is absolutely awesome. Tremendous value for the price. Really good quality, lots of pouches and pockets, can't say enough about this bag. I've got a lot of gear so I was looking to carry less bags and keep more than just the camera in one bag. I keep a Canon HV20 in it with tons of other gear, lighting, cords, tripod mounts, wide angle lense, batteries,etc, and still has room another camera and extra gear. Looks small at first, but fits a lot of gear. Definitely worth every penny.
