Good...... but
This app does exactly as advertised. It allows me to make free calls and texts with ease. The only thing is.... on the Kindle fire HD I am unable to get notifications of when I get a text which defeats basically the whole purpose. If this were to be fixed then it would definitely get 5 stars.
