It works beautifully.
Unfortunately the CD does not work at all.  That's the only bad thing I have to say about it.  Without the ability to install software off the disk I download it from the manufacturer's website and installed it, it took under a second to install from the download. If your disk doesn't work this is what I used:[...]The software is quite light.  It has a main view screen on the left hand window that provides a large view of what the camera sees, the right hand screen is a tabbed display that shows either photos or videos that you have already taken with the camera.  It provides a few settings such as image correction and folder location, but apart from that it's a very simple piece that does nothing more than make it work. This thing is remarkably simple to use.  To zoom in you actually just move the camera closer to your subject, the big twister on the side is for focus.  The other review that tell you the stand is rubbish have merit, the stand itself is fine, but the little plastic things holding the camera could use improvement. The camera itself has a switch that turns the more than sufficient LED lights from off to low to high, and button that takes a snapshot.  The snapshot button only works if the software is running.  I honestly don't know whether the camera has a full 200x magnification, for that I would direct you to the video filmed by another reviewer.  I do know that what looks like a blurry grey square on the calibration sheet becomes a set of lines under the microscope's eye. I would recommend this to anybody wanting to buy a microscope that's easy to use and affordable.
