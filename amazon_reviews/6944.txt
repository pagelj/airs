Get this for Protection
I am not one that believes that UV protection is necessary for shooting photography with today's SLRs. I cannot notice a difference in photographs with or w/o this type of filter. They DO, however, protect the lens on the camera from bumps and accidental scratches.. If you are going to use an expensive lens, you want to put a UV filter on to protect the your lens. Tiffen makes a good choice, and I buy one for each lens that I have so they are never unprotected.
