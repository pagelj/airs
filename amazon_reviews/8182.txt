I didn't have the problems with overfill that others described, but then I only used two scoops of coffee/mug. The machine is a little flimsy and can easily be knocked about on the counter. It is a bit of a fuss to make just one mug of coffee - but if you are "Zen" about it, it becomes like an Asian Tea Ceremony - and you don't leave a half pot of coffee untouched. I lived with my machine for eactly one month of daily use - we were happy together, we greeted each other every morning - then it died this morning without warning or a beep. I won't be buying another - so for about 50 cents/day I had a coffee helper, and now I just have a travel mug as a token of our brief relationship.
