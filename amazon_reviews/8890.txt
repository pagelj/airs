Nice follow up to All Jacked Up and great lead up to Cowgirls Don't Cry
I love the Rough Riders series and I thought it was nice with a follow up to Keely and Jack's story. If you have not read All Jacked Up: Rough Riders, Book 8 or any of the other RR books, it might seem a little disjointed (I am guessing here). But since it does say in the product description that it is a Rough Riders free read you kinda should have figured out on your own that it would lean heavily on previous knowledge of the previous books. It is also a lead-up to the other RR book that came out the same day, Cowgirls Don't Cry: Rough Riders, Book 10, which is also a very very good book. If you have read the RR books I am sure you will find it to be a nice little addition to the "family" :o) I would highly recommend this story and I would have payed for it if it wasn't free!
