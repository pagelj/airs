Product looks nice.  I prefer the type with only 2 knobs and a dedicated toaster function.  This one combines all functions with several possible settings.  A bit confusing, and toasting is hard to do exactly right. Because there are two levels for the wire insert, the baking tray has to be made for the smaller of the two.  The baking tray is smaller than the space available on the lower level, limiting the size of what can be baked.  Not my favorite design, but after researching all the competitors, I still think this one is the best for the price.
