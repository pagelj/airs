Great little camera-but no accessories
I purchased two of these cameras as Christmas presents for my granddaughters. Delivery was delayed, even though I am a Prime member. Great little cameras. They take good pictures. I wanted the girls to be able to easily transfer their pictures to digital picture frames. The "Frequently Bought Together" ad led me to believe that the camera used flash memory cards. It doesn't. The purchase only included the camera, no instructions, no cables, no software. This wasn't stated in the product description, and I was very disappointed. Not a good price when you must find and purchase accessories that should have been included with the camera.
