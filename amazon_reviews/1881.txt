Watch your Lens Cover
A lot of people have done a good job covering the camera.  I am highly pleased with it.  I do have one caution.  The tiny lens cover that covers the lens when it is powered down is subject to being damaged easily.  I noticed something on my lens recently when I was out taking pictures.  After having cleaned the lens, I powered the camera off and noticed that thin cover did not close properly. Recommendation:  do not put it in your pocket without a case covering the lens.  I believe that something in my pocket caused the problem with the lens cover.  This problem did not affect the funcion, just won't close properly at this time
