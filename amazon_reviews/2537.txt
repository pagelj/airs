Good video for the price
I agree with the other reviews that this is a decent product for the price. The video quality is not HD as claimed, but it certainly works as a dashboard camera to record accidents. The audio is poor, but audio's not really the reason you buy this item. If you live in an area with nutty drivers, this would pay for itself with the first accident. The SD cards easily pop into a laptop for viewing. The built-in screen is a bit small to review videos and is really better just for aiming it. The suction cup device is excellent and hold the camera just fine.
