Worked for one minute
It worked for one minute then a little black smoke started from where the charger goes into the ipod... it then burnt up.  Luckily it did not damage the ipod and my son was sitting right there when it happened.  I am so thankful it was not laying on his bed or something we may have had a bad fire.
