A great basic Blu-ray player
This is a fantastic basic Blu-ray DVD player at a fantastic price ($59.98 on 1/19/2012). I wanted a Blu-ray player DVD that could also stream Netflix content, and this player fits the bill. Be aware that this player does not have a wireless network card, so you must connect the player to your router with an Ethernet cable. If these specs meet your needs, then I think you will be satisfied with this product. I did have to perform a firmware upgrade when I first started the Blu-ray player. The upgrade was straightforward, but on the reboot the player froze. I unplugged the power cord and plugged the player back in, and the player booted normally and displayed a message that the firmware was successfully upgraded.
