A surprisingly intelligent sci-fi movie
A group of armed men and women take over a grocery store in a small town in Arizona. At first it looks like a robbery but as they gather the employees and customers they are looked at by one member of their group and shot on sight on his say so. One of the customers turns out to be a local cop who manages to call the robbery in and start shooting bad guys. When the dust settles the store is surrounded by police. The "robbers" gather all of the remaining employees and customers in a backroom. Slowly their actual purpose for being there emerges, as does their back story as the police investigate outside. I was pleasantly surprised by Alien Raiders. I bought it for $2 at a Blockbuster going out of business sale and didn't expect much from it. Low budget and made by a small studio is usually a recipe for bad acting, writing and story telling. But the Alien Raider story, while borrowing ideas from sci-fi that went before it, told its story in an imaginative way. The writing and acting were also a notch above what I expected and it was nice to see Carlos Bernard, one of my favorites from the TV series 24. With a small budget there weren't a lot of special effects, mostly some heavy make-up. The title is a bad one, but the movie was good.
