Easily the finest toaster I have ever owned and it looks great, to boot.  I must admit, the first time I used it there was a slight metallic "burning" smell, but that disappeared in ensuing uses.  As others have commented on the length and width of the bread slots are impressive, indeed.  Finally, good bakery "round" loaves can be toasted without having toast the bread in halves as with standard toasters. The settings, automatic drop and rise of slots as well as the thawing features make this an indispensible kitchen tool.  And again, it looks wicked cool for a toaster!
