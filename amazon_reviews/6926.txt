It was okay for a while....
I bought it for the looks. I love the design. But this week was the last straw! Lately (for the past year or so) we've had a ton of trouble with it burning some slices, toasting unevenly, etc. Then a couple of days ago the button stuck and it just kept right on cooking... and just about burned our kitchen down. Definitely do not buy. I'm looking at the reviews and buying something a little more high-end that hopefully will last.
