I replace my old microwave oven, made by panasonic (Quasar) then the top of the line 600 watts, did not have single problem for 26 years. We replace it for energy efficiency and the invertor technology, easy intuitive controls and during the first month, my wife has not found a problem to complain about (yeah !) the unit is slightly smaller that the old one. I will highly recommend this unit. I would like to write a review after one year of use.
