Great Product
I am thoroughly pleased with this device. It works wonderfully and carries out the task it was designed for. My only problems are that its own charge depletes faster than I anticipated and sometimes the adapter loses connection and it will stop charging without you realizing it. But overall it works very well and I am very pleased.
