great, inexpensive
great product, easy to install - much less expensive than some of the other options out there - but for what it is, its a great price.  I wasnt sure how it was going to be installed, but it has a pretty strong adhesive around the edge that keeps it in place.  Have had it a few months and it hasnt fallen off or become loose, so I would say its staying put until I take it off.
