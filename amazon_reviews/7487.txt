Hard to put down
Season of the Harvest is a well written story in the tradition of Robert Heinlein's Puppet Masters.  You can also sense the influence of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle on Michael Hick's work.  The aliens in the story, unlike those in his excellent "In Her Name" series, are uncomplicated in their evil attempts to gain control of our world.  A nice twist to the story is the real life complication of current food industry's influence on the global food supply and on our society.  The story of "aliens" really become a parable about human greed and single minded devotion to agricultural practices that dominate and may threaten the earth.  Even if all of those threads are not of personal interest or concern, readers will enjoy the adventure story. I especially enjoyed the character development of one of the side characters that led to a "poetic" moment toward the end.  In the end, the most important message of the author is the importance of educating ourselves about the practices of genetically modified food and not always assuming that all we are told is truth, from either side.
