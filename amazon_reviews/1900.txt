Great for the price
I don't think you can get a better video/audio monitor for the price. The plastic is cheap and its very light weight. But, we don't care as long as it works. We can see and hear our little guy very clear no matter day or night. I don't know why we waited so long to get a video monitor. It is well worth the extra $20 to upgrade from just the audio to Video and Audio. Our last audio monitor had major issues with cutting out, shutting off and major wifi interference issues. No such issues with the Infant Optics. We are very pleased and we LOVE the ability to have the monitor battery operated so we can bring it downstairs or outside while he sleeps. The more expensive systems had bigger screens, but had to be plugged in which was a deciding factor FOR this one. The only thing is I wish it had is the ability to shut off the video and just use audio. We have a white noise machine in the nursery and that keeps the video and audio on constantly at night which even at the lowest "brightness" setting is still bright at night. So the VOX setting doesn't work for us because of the noise machine.  Overall, we love it and would recommend it.
