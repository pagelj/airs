Waking Up Married
Well, this book was defiantly an interesting novel. I mean, it was different from all the romance novels that I have read. Every single one of them married for love. And they married for partners. It was such a turn for me. All the characters were awesome and I really enjoyed this novel. And in the end, they married for love. Ah, gives me a warm feeling. Bubbly up inside.
