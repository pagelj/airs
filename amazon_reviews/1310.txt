Great Bag Baby
This bag is very well designed. You can slip your dslr right in the top with the lens pointing down or if you have a large flash and you are using a smaller lens, then you can put it in with the flash going down. So all you have to do is unzip a little and pull out the camera and it's ready to go. There are also many extra pockets that are easy to get to. I carry everything that I own for my camera and a few diapers, wipes, change of baby clothes and more. It's even comfortable. What more can I say, I love this bag.
