Just as described BUT DIRECTV customers BE ADVISED!
I purchased this specifically for HBO GO but can't use that feature because I am a DIRECTV subscriber, which does NOT support HBO GO on Roku. A real disappointment for me! On the bright side, I do enjoy the Amazon Prime instant videos and the Pandora channel. Also, it's simple to operate with crystal clear pictures and no technical glitches so far, so I won't be sending back.
