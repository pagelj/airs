Hinges not well made
I bought two of these, for my two 24" monitors. These mounts are decent - I mean they do what they're supposed to do; they mount my screens to my walls, and allow me to move them around on the swivel.- Problem: The hinges seem slightly loose. Yes, there are indeed places to tighten them to keep them from swiveling around too much, but in terms of loose, I mean bendy loose, not swiveling loose. It's like the pin isn't a tight enough fit in the hinge. When I pull the screen out from the wall, it dips down more than when it's up against the wall. It's not 'that' noticeable when it's straight, but when I try to swivel the monitor over to the side, so it's, say, 45 degrees with the wall, you can tell that it's sagging, because the screen dips sideways by about half an inch on one side. These aren't extremely heavy monitors either; they're fairly lightweight. Considering how the mounts are designed, I suppose a slight sag is to be expected. It seems that other users also had this issue.- The problem is fairly minor; not enough to return, or swap these out with different mounts. I'm happy with them - they were cheap, easy to install, and work perfectly fine for what I need them for. I would expect a slight sag from other mounts that extend out as far as these ones do as well.
