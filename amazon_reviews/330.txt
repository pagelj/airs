case
I really do like this case, except for the color it looks dark brown unless you look at it under the lights, then you can tell it is dark purple. The picture of it is a beautiful purple,but when you take it out of the box you would swear it was brown. I really hope it protects the kindle that is the main reason i bought it, but people need to know it does not look like the picture.
