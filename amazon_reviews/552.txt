Perfect
I have had my camera for two weeks and it works great. The picture quality is professional grade.  I spend hours outdoors with my camera and my nature pictures are incredible.  Get the Rebel T31100D field guide written by Charlotte K. Lowrie and have fun.  Purchased from Amazon and got package deal with Zoom Lens.  Great value.  Easy to use, lots of creativity options.  If your a beginner this is a good pick to learn and grow with.
