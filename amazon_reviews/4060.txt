Wrong order
Hello we purchased this AmScope 20x40x80x scope for our son for Christmas of 2012 and we finally opened it for the summer (2013) to make long summer science project. When we opened it we realized we had the WRONG microscope from what we ordered. Talked about being ticked of a bit and what's even worse this microscope doesn't even come with a complete instruction manual for parents. I understand these product are probably mostly used in science labs at schools. So we are sitting here still trying how to use the piece of equipment to no avail. I mean I could possibly be wrong by the fact this binocular scope could indeed be the right product, but how am I suppose to know since it does come with  guide/booklet/instructions??????? I mean I cannot even give it a proper review either nor even use this piece of equipment. Personally, I believe one would have to know how to use this binocular microscope as beginner because obviously you have to be a novice in order to know how to use this microscope. Overall, my score has to be a one star, unless I can get some kind of proper manual/booklet and I am sorry, I want where I can sit down and studying like a book rather than waste ink on from a printer.  Then as for the DVD that comes with it, you need to have a PDF converter in order to read the manual on how to use the computers program for the binocular scope unless you have taken some kind of course. Basically this product is good for the professionals instead of for those who want to teach their children on how to use it. I know for a fact, I would know how to use this Christmas and to teach myself and my son if we had the PROPER instruction guide.
