Not up to par for Martin's works.
I love Martin's works. I love Westeros and its mythos. I have come to care about Winterfell, King's Landing, Riverrun, Harrenhal, and Castle Black. Even Sunspear and the Iron Islands, and Braavos. But ADWD did little to make me care about what happens to Meereen. Theon's arc is wonderful and a flash of the brilliance Martin has shown in Thrones and Swords. Griff and Victarion had some great chapters and look forward to more of them. But those are about the only highlights of this weighty novel until some fine ending notes. My major concerns:1. Jon and Dany politicking is important, but the process is boring and repetitive. Cut down to half the number of chapters for each of them and you wouldn't miss a beat.2. Tyrion spends the greater portion of this book trying to make himself, my former favorite character, as unlikable as possible. In addition, his journeys through Essos are even less interesting than Brienne's wanderings, because we are not invested in the places or the people around him like we are in Westeros' riverlands.3. Bran and Davos' story arcs are important and exciting, until they get cut off halfway through to the book so we can endure Dany's pining for Daario for another chapter or two.4. Quentyn's tale feels like such a waste of pages. I wanted to care about it, I really did, but all I got out of it was agreeing with his companion Arch about wanting to leave Slaver's Bay.
