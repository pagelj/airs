When I first bought it I thought it was a miracle machine.  It picked up the dog hair and everything so well I was in heaven.  Then the attachment stopped working while I was using it to clean the stairs, stopping spinning.  Then my daughter ran something over and broke the belt.  Replaced the belt without a problem and it is still intact.  It has no suction, pushes the dog hair around the carpet, spews dirt in the air.  Took the whole thing apart and checked for clogs, cleaned the filter and still won't work right.  Oh, it also turns itself off after about 5 minutes.  Back to looking for something that will work.  I've used expensive uprights, expensive canisters, cheap uprights like this one and cheap canisters.  None of them last.  I'm tired of spending money I don't have and being told the warranty does not cover the problems I have with them.
