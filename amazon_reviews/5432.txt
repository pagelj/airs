Not Good
This e-book is nearly worthless. It doesn't have page numbers, but instead has location numbers which makes trying to find assignments in class difficult. I'm also certain that the publisher didn't proof read this book either. It's full of miss-spellings and wrong file names. Example Comically Design when should be Camashaly Design.
