Saved my lens
I use this as a cheap pass-through, which it does well. I have no idea what happened to my camera, but this filter totally saved my Tamron lens. I think a car seat was slid backward and it hit the camera, but I'm not sure. Regardless, the filter was shattered and bent on one edge -- this surely would have destroyed my good lens had the filter not been in place! Ordering a replacement right now.
