Just couldn't get into it
I purchased this based on all the positive reviews, unfortunately it just not my cup of tea. The story progresses extremely slowly.... I feel like I'm serving time just reading it. I typically like a story that moves at a faster pace. There is also a lot of repetition, with similar scenes described in painful detail each time. On the plus side it does seem well edited. Unfortunately, I wasn't even able to bring myself to finish it.
