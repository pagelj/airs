Crazy little thing "cute and funny"!
This is the first book I have read by this author and I loved it! There were many moments throughout the story that had me smiling but then other moments that had me laughing out loud. I couldn't put the book down. Would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking for a cute, funny, romantic book. ( sorry, but its  definitely not for those of you who are looking to read a romantic book with detailed sex scenes. Its pretty clean in that department. )
