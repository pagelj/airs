For the price, this set is worth it. I've had it for many years and about half the knives have made it this far. They're not the best knives you'll ever own, by any means, but if you're on a tight budget, they'll work. While I was using one of the bigger knives, the blade came out of the handle. And some of the rivets have fallen out, which is why I threw many of them away. I put these in the dishwasher even though it says not to, because I'm just not patient enough for handwashing my knives. The handles do seem flimsy, and the knives don't stay very sharp, but again-- at this price, it's a fine "starter set."
