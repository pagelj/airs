Great choice for baby monitor!
We are very pleased that we selected a monitor with video.  It definitely helps to see the baby when you hear a sound rather than having to go into the room to determine if the sound might indicate something of significance.  This is a great buy for the money.  I was very  impressed with the quality of the video even in the dark when the infrared is functioning.  No regrets.  We would recommend it to anyone.
