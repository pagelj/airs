I bought this in June 2011 and took it home to find that the bottom element did not work.  Called the Black and Decker customer service number and was put on hold for 20 minutes.  Eventually left my number and they did not call me back.  Could not find a way to email customer service. Ended up taking it back to the store and bought another product.  Even with just one element the stove exterior got quite hot and the timing device was hard to use.
