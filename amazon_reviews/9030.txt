Prelude to domestic violence
Prelude to domestic violenceI never write reviews unless I love something or hate it. This book falls into the second category. I borrowed this book from a friend and was so glad I didn't pay for it. All I can say is any woman who thinks this is a romance novel must have a very warped sense of what love is. Really. Jessse is abusive, controlling and I thought physically repulsive (sludge colored eyes... what was the author THINKING??) This man is not a damaged, intriguing Alpha male - he is a sad, pathetic, needy jerk who tries to bolster his ego by trampling on a vulnerable woman in every way he can. All I could imagine was a poor woman, Ava, with low self esteem being abused by this nasty piece of work. He is NOT sexy. Women who gave this book 5 stars and loved Jesse... is this your fantasy man? Or are you enjoying being a voyeur to a relationship of abuse unfolding before your very eyes? If my best friend (bad best friend, Kate) went near a man like this I'd be calling a domestic violence hotline. Rip-offs: Ava - Eva, Bared To You. Kate, Kate Kavanagh, Fifty Shades. Not to mention the book cover RIP-OFF which is IDENTICLE to Switch by Megan Hart.
