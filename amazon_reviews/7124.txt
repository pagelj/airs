Lower price on Canon 5D Mark III
I have been researching and wanting to purchase a Canon 5D Mark III, understanding it addresses many of the issues I have experienced with my Canon 5D Mark II over the past couple of years.  About a week ago the price from Amazon was $2,949.  Overnight the price jumped to $3,299, apparently due to Canon increasing its prices on its cameras.  Tonight I discovered itselling for $2,629.99 at RjRichies. com[...],selling for $2,749 at 42nd Street Photo[...] andselling for $2,674.99 at Primotronix[...]I am unfamiliar with these three vendors, but for a difference of $750, I think I might give one of them a try.
