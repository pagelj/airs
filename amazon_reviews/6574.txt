LG840G
The LG840G is defiantly a step up from the previous phones tracfone has offered. The phone is not a smart phone and sadly the adverts show the Android bot infront of the phone leaving you believe it is Android powered. The phone is still designed to look and work more like a android phone than the ones in the past. The wifi is a nice feature letting you browse the web without using minutes and also for me not having to switch from a ipod to my phone. The tracfone browser has been changed from .50 minutes for every minute online to how much data is being used which is  more forgiving as before you would be instantly charged .50 minutes just to access the web. The 3G is a nice feature that only a few will use but makes you feel that you are on a smartphone. If you have a old flip phone or even a LG800 this phone is a great buy for someone who doesnt use the phone enough to justify a plan. Beware that tracfone may be releasing better and possibly real smart phones in the summer/fall of 2013Pros:Wifi/3GBetter touchscreen than LG800Android style OS designNo frontside Tracfone symbol to give it away2GB of memoryCons:No a Smartphone even though adverts show the Android Bot infront of the phoneOnly a 2MP camera while other tracfones have a 3MP
