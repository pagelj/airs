There is a reason that this vacuum was rated a "CR Choice" best buy by Consumer Reports.  Its a great vacuum cleaner regardless of the floor type.  It is awesome on carpet and great on hard floors.  It is a breeze to use and the self propelled feature makes it so that our six year old can use it with ease.  If you use the attachments a lot go ahead and get the extended hose.
