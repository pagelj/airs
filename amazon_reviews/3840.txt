Great hood!
The construction is great. Does not look fragile at all like some of the reviews said. Screws onto the lens smoothly. I have yet to get my UV filter (sarcastic: thanks for the speedy delivery 47th st photo) so I have yet to see how it screws on to the filter treads. I don't know who said the hood leaves no room for the focus ring, but I do not see that problem at all and I'm a big guy with stubby fingers. I gave it only 4 stars because the lens cap has very little to grab onto within the hood. I have yet to see if the cap pops off on its own because of this especially during travel.
