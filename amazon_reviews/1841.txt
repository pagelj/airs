Perfect for kids
I was looking for a little tv as my 4 year old calls it . Battery life was important and built in battery. This unit is very easy to use, light and the battery life is great. For the price 99.00 it was the best name brand 9 inch I could find. The screen is clear and the sound is good . Only downside is the Cord to plug into the wall is shorter than my last one
