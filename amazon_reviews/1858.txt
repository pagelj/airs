Great product
All of my past cameras were point and shoot but I wanted a camera that took a better picture.  This is a great transitional camera if you're not familiar and not a professional.  The user book is easy to read and follow.  Pictures are beautiful.  Light weight and not as much of a burden as I thought it would be to carry around.  I read many other reviews from people that sounded like they knew what they were talking about, which really helped.  But this is a post for those that aren't photography/camera savvy but just want a great picture.  I highly recommend this camera.
