Perfect way to haul around a single knife
I took a cooking course and didn't want to buy a full roll at one extreme or take my knives (2 of them) naked or towel wrapped on the other.  This was a great compromise. I bought one and very quickly bought another.  It fits all my 8 in knives, stays securely fashioned and definitely protects the knives.  I'm guessing it'd fit most shapes in this length category unless you have something like a fillet knife that isn't broad enough and slips out or something really wide like a specialty knife.  I generally use it for my 8" global or 8" Mac.  It would also fit several others I own, however. No durability problems thus far.  Snaps still work like they did the first time although I've only used them a little less than a dozen times, so I don't know how much that really says. Easy to clean... I can't remember whether or not this claims to be dishwasher safe, but as far as I'm concerned, it is. I like using it... definitely the best way to haul around single knives.
