Too small for my Canon SX150
I bought my Canon PowerShot SX150 online and this case showed up as recommended and "frequently bought together" product. I went ahead to buy this case. When I received it, I found that its a bit too tight for the camera. I have to force the zip around to close it with just the camera ( no accessories) and I fear it will tear down pretty soon. I do feel its partly my fault as I didn't check the dimensions beforehand, but I would sure have not bought this case for my camera if they didn't list as "frequently bought together" product.
