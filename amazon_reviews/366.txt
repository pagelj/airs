You pay for what you get....
This is a really nice camera with lots of features accessible via buttons and thumb wheels.  I'm very happy that my wife purchased it for my birthday.  It's not a DSLR, but short of that and cameras priced at twice as much, it's at the top of it's class and from what I've read, image wise, comparable to the Canon G15.  It works well in low light and the image stabilization works as advertised, allowing you to get some pretty interesting shots in light that was hitherto inadequate for taking pictures. Like most in it's class, including the G15... it's no focusing speed demon when using the image stabilization.  But I find, image wise, that it's more than worth the money... from 28mm to 200mm (35mm equivalent.)The cameras to watch for are the newer CMOS compacts with the DX sized sized sensors, which are, for now, out of my price range. Since the P7700 will accept screw on filters, buy a daylight or UV filter at the same time and as soon as you take the camera out of the box, attach the filter.  It will protect the front objective and allow you to aggressively clean the filter instead of the lens, should you need to do so.  And, with the filter in place, I no longer use the lens cap.  Just sayin'.
