cheetah mounts
The mount shipped VERY quickly, I recieved it 2 days after I ordered it.  We installed it with ease... the only problem we encountered is the built in level was WAY OFF, DO NOT rely on this use your own level.... the built in level showed it was perfectly level but when you put the tv up it was sooo obvious that is was well over 1/2" off!!!  So the only advice I can offer.... use your own level!!!!  Other than that the mount was great... my husband who is 190 pounds hung from it before we hung the tv and didnt budge!!!!  I was so impressed we ordered another one the next day... we received it today and plan to put that one in the entertainment room!  Great Product!!
