So far so good
I have only had my recorder for about a month.  So far it has worked perfectly.  The real test is if it still works this well a year from now.  That is the problem with most of these combination recorders.  One side or the other stops working.  I have a Toshiba Tv that has lasted for several years and hope the recorder is as good.
