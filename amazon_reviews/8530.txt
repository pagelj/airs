Just OK
I really don't like this lens that much. I am going to be the odd man out on these reviews and say that it is soft and the focusing is just OK. I have a really cheap Sigma 50-200 lens that I prefer at 50mm pretty much all the time over this lens. Maybe I just got a bad copy, but I would save a little more for the 1.4 if I were you. It is cheap though, so it's OK for a starting out lens.
