Does NOT fit Lenovo Yoga 13
I purchased this case for Lenovo Yoga 13 as advertised and it does NOT fit that laptop. It barely zips up over it and I can tell that this cheap "case" will not tolerate the pressure imposed over its zippers due to bad fit. Just like many other similar "cases" this one is poor quality and bad advertisement. Such cases should cost $5 not whatever it cost.
