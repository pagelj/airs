Amazing
I read about thirty books a year, most of them sci-fi, for the technology exploration and the fact that I grew up with Star Wars. The writing is usually crap and the the themes are lame, but I deal with it. Once in a while, you find a sci-fi book that challenges the little philosophical nut in your brain as well giving you a wonderful read. This is one of them.
