Horrible instructions
I suppose the recorder is ok, I'm giving it one star for the poor manual and Toshiba customer service. A professional could probably set this up and use it with no problem, but the average person is going to have big problems. This replaced a broken unit that was relatively easy to use. I was able to record, but when it came time to play it back, after it was finalized, it refused to play. I finally found ONE LINE in very small print that gave a clue. No where in the manual does it say what this setting is for, it certainly isn't obvious from the words on screen. I found two phone numbers for Toshiba in the manual--the first phone number asked the usual questions to punch in on your phone, including the model number and serial number. Then the recording directed you to a web site that was absolutely no help at all. A second phone number gave only a busy signal over a 4 day period.
