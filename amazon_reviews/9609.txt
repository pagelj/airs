GREAT Camera
So happy with this camera.  It takes great indoor and outdoor pictures.  We have a SLR camera that we love but is big and bulky, I can keep this one in my purse and it works great.  Went to Ripley's aquarium with it and the lighting is very dim/non existant in places this camera took good quality pictures with vibrant colors.  Love it.
