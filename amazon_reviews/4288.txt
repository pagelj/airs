Bloated like affc
There are too much uninteresting characters and side-plots. The main plot does not advance enough and is buried in a see of useless fillers. I think the author should have made book 4 and 5 into one book, it would have been faster to write and more interesting to read. The good news is GRRM has no choice but to end side-plots has we get close to the saga conclusion in book 6 and 7.  I once taught the TV series could combine book 4 and 5 on the same timeline and then show it over 2 seasons. But after reading ADWD, the TV series should just slash 50% of the material and cover book 4 & 5 in season 4.
