Awesome! Read it!
It has been a few years since I read a book where the main character was not a werewolf, vampire or shape-shifting coyote. When I started reading "Wool" (because I was out of urban fantasy and it was cheap) it made me remember that it doesn't require a supernatural plot or impossible characters to take you completely out of your own reality. It takes a magnificent writer. I just finished reading Wool 5 and Mr. Howey's writing style as the books progress has slowly grown into such beautiful and descriptive prose that I found myself re-reading sentences over and over just because of the vivid mental images they project. The first book is written more starkly which fits perfectly with the story and how it is told. The writing becomes more descriptive as the story evolves and you start to understand where it's taking you. In "Wool" Mr. Howey has written an amazing story that illustrates the most beautiful and horrific sides of the human condition at the same time.
