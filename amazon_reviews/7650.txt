Great Value & Easy to Use, But Very Bad Nighttime Photos
I was replacing an old Kodak Easyshare, so at $80, this camera seemed like a steal. It's easy to setup, offers 720HD video with sound (and it's good quality), but it can't take a night picture (such as a cityscape) to save it's life. I've tried every setting in both manual and automatic modes, and you have to take 5 or 6 photo's to possibly get 1 good one that is clear. For photo's in light, no problem! The image in your nice size LCD for night photo's is the one I desire, but never the one I get. Battery life is very good, including when you use video. The video feature is easy to use, BUT, you must zoom in or out BEFORE you start the video recording. Once recording, you cannot zoom. It is a great deal, but if I had to do it all over again I would make sure the camera could take night pictures, and that the video featured zoom while recording. Again, great deal, easy to use, but 1 or 2 major flaws.  Simply because of the inability to take a good night shot, I would not recommend to a friend to get one.
