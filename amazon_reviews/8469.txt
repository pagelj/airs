Fun, and great in a fight
It is a comb that is best for thin and/or short hair, the teeth are tiny but perfectly functional.  My hair is almost too thick to work, but it does. I was drinking at a bar with some buddies and a guy wanted to fight, I pulled the handle out, flipped the comb open, and the fight was immediately defused in laughter and the jerk bought me some drinks.
