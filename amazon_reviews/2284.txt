Promising, but it seems the author lost interest.
Lady Sophia's rescue started amuzing, a regular Regency trifle. Then it goes downhill, the hero doesn't get any explanation, we are just informed he's rich. That's okay, but it does mean this book gets a few points deducted. What really dissapointed me though, was the climax. It seems like the author just didn't feel like writing anymore and just wrapped it up without any attention. The big finale finished in a few lines. Very dissapointing
