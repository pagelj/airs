when will we get more?
I discovered your series while searching to see if maybe Jerry Ahern's "Survivalist" paperback series has been "Kindleized", which I guess it hasn't. I really enjoyed your Peacemaker series and quickly gobbled up all six. My only "complaint" is that for some reason or other I just can't get a mental picture of what The Peacemaker and the drones all look like! It looks like maybe in number 4 there were supposed to be some pics,but they just all say "picture missing". Anyway -I enjoyed the first 6 and am wondering if more are in the works, and if so when number 7 will be published? Thanks for the entertainment Ricky!
