Best laptop bag I've ever owned.
I've had this bag for about 5 years, and it's been thrown around, abused, suffered through motorcycle rides, and even had a 17" laptop stuff into it for the entire duration.  The only sign of wear that it shows is a spot in the main zipper where I forced the bag to close over the corner of the laptop.  Completely the owner's (me) fault. I have had experiences with many other bags, for work laptops, friend's, girlfriends, etc, and this has by FAR held up the best out of any of them.
