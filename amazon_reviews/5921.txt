Great Ska album!!
If you are a fan of ska music you cannot go wrong with this cd. If you havent heard the toasters you should give them a listen. This cd is a great place to start if you havent heard any of their other material. Most of the songs on here are played at a moderate speed. Some of the songs such as talk is cheap have been re-recorded over the years at a faster tempo so there is at least two versions and they are both great. This album is a classic!
