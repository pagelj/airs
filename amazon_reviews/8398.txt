More than willing to help
I am so glad I gave this company my business. I mistook the 13'3" for this one and had to swap it out but the people knew exactly what needed to be done and did it without question and in a timely fashion. My only complaint is that the cloth case is thinner than I expected. But it works all the same! I get compliments on it all the time. Very pleased.
