works as advertised
I bought this screen for my new iPhone 5. Normally I don't like putting anything on my phone because I feel it takes away from the design of the phone. I hate screen protectors and cases... especially ridiculous over-sized cases that basically transform a phone like the iPhone into a brick you can use to kill someone. That's the rant. BUT living with a 2 year old who managed to scratch the heck out of my previous phone in less than 5 seconds I have reconsidered. I bought this screen protector and so far it worked great! I really have no complaints, you barely notice the protective film being there, it doesn't take away from the beauty and clarity of the screen and it really does protect the screen from scratches. Bottom line: I would buy it again and I would definitely recommend it. P. S. Hey, psst! If you're looking for a minimalistic case for the iPhone5 that doesn't transform the device into a ridiculous brick try this: http://www. amazon. com/SF-Matte-Black-Feeling-Unlocked/dp/B00993E8B6/ref=sr_1_1? s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1361551836&sr=1-1&keywords=ringke+slim+iphone+5  I love it.
