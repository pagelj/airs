SONY DVD PLAYER / Quality for sure!
I purchased this item as a gift for its' quality and ease of use for a dear "senior" friend of mine who is cramped for space. She seems to love the EASE OF USE;  QUALITY OF ITEM and the amount of space she was limited to for dvd use. She cannot seem to say enough of great things about this player.  It is the first one she has ever used in her eighty + yrs. of movie viewing and she has had absolutely no problems with it at all in any way."She wanted me to post this recommendation hoping it helps someone decide on an inexpensive way to get quality and ease of use from a product from a reputable company" through Amazon online. This player only takes one dvd at a time.......'Progressive Scan' simply means that it can take a standard DVD (which is 480i) and output a progressive signal (480p).  It has nothing to do with more than one dvd.... Hope this helps! She needed a player that did not take up alot of room; easy to use and one that PLAYS MOVIES and PLAYS HER MUSIC CD'S as well and this player does all of that and she is very happy!
