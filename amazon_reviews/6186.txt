Great toaster!
When our previous toaster was on it's last leg, or shall I say burner, we grabbed a cheapie at a local chain store, I used it and knew it was not good, then my husband used it and told me it was worthless, would only toast (burn at any setting) on one side, so after just a few uses.. into the garbage can, I would not even put it into a garage sale! The Cuisinart is wonderful, we make toast for any reason. I wish I had room on my countertop to leave it out, because it also looks very good.
