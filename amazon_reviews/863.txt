Awesome!
These screen covers are just as described. They feel just like the device screen. They are very clear and don't distort the screen at all. They do get fingerprints just like the uncovered screen but it cleans easily. Installation was easy and watching the video on Tech Armor's site was really helpful. Their recommendation to use scotch tape to help reposition the cover and remove dust particles during installation is brilliant! Get these, you won't be disappointed!
