good case for the price
It fits well and resists popping off when dropped.  My only beef is that this case (unlike one of the other ones we purchased) chips and cracks when dropped onto a hard surface (mind you it was only after several such falls that the corners started cracking).  It's got a great whimsical pattern, and a nice soft feel to it.  After 3 months though, the design is starting to wear off where the cracks happened from being dropped.  Great product for the price.
