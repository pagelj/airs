I really like these knives. I've been making do with a totally crappy set, biding my time until I could afford a high-end set. I haven't quite arrived at that time, however, and I just couldn't take using my old set anymore (I cook a lot). I saw these in a store (for under $100, so do some comparison pricing before you click the order button), pulled up the reviews on this site, and went with the purchase based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. I'm so glad I did. These make a world of difference in my daily life. I can't say how they compare to the really high end knives since I've never used any, but compared to other well known brands with similar pricing to the Chicago Cutlery, these are superior. Plus, the look nice, they feel great, and they wash up well (hand wash and dry only). I haven't had them long, but I intend to take excellent care of them and keep them sharpened, and I have faith they will hold up. Overall, this is a very good purchase if you're considering other brands in the same price bracket.
