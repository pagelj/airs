Well worth the money!
This is a well made bag and for the price I don't think you will find a better one. I really only have two complaints about this bag but they are not big deals. I have a Canon 60D with the grip which makes for a rather tall rig. I wish the bag was about two inches deeper so the zipper would be just above the camera when it is setting in it, if you do not have a grip then it will fit perfect. The other complaint is the way the straps ride my body, not sure why it doesn't feel right when I wear it but it doesn't. It's something with the way the shoulder straps are designed it. Other than those nit-pick'ins I love the bag.... I have yet to see anything... especially for the price that can touch it!.. These are just my opinions... your mileage may vary :-)Here is a list of the items in my bag now.
