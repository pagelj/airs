No memory card and needs a computer
I admit I'm a digital camera novice, as my camera that just died was an old film camera.  So I expected this camera to be ready to go right out of the box without any other digital necessity, so I thought I could just take the camera or memory card to the processing shops to download any photos I took.  I also did NOT expect to have to buy a memory card.  I only have a very old computer at home and didn't realize that these new digital cameras REQUIRE a reasonably new computer in order to function.  That is, you have to have a fairly new computer to download lots of the information you need to operate the camera--it is fed into the camera as well as the manual being digital.  I'm giving it 3 stars, though I really didn't want to rate it, just wanted to warn novices like me that you need a computer to get anything out of this camera and you have to buy a memory card along with the camera even if you have a newer computer.  I wish on the description it didn't just say what programs it was compatible with (I mistakenly thought that meant that you COULD use it with those programs, not that you HAD to have those programs for it to work), but that a 2007 or newer computer was NECESSARY as well as emphasizing that a memory card had to be bought separately.  If that information had been obvious, I would not have ordered (and had to return, though losing my shipping fees in the process) this camera.
