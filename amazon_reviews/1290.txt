Divergent better then Hunger Games
Insurgent (Divergent) I wrote a review on Insurgent. I came upon this book by my great luck. I loved it. Yes I have read The Hunger Games. It does kinda give ou that same vibe, but I actualy liked this better. I wish I had read this first. I also wish this had been made into a movie before they did the Hunger Games. Please kittys don't kill me but this was better and more tangable. I could see this happening sooner rather then later, before I could see the Hunger Games. Don't get me wrong I like the Hunger Games- books and movie. I just liked this BETTER!!!
