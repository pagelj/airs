1632 and beyond
One of the first e-books I ever read.  When I saw this on Amazon's kindle book list I grabbed it up immediately and once again plunged into the alternate universe created in 1632.  The blend of historical accuracy and sci-fi what ifs can only be described as enlightening.  Written for young adults and avid readers in equal measure the authors blend the deep held pride of Appalachian folk with the mid-evil mind set of Saxon Germany in a style that is both highly entertaining and easy to read.  Start this book on a friday because you wont want to put it down until your done.
