On the go perfect
I'm a big fan of Case Logic products, so I had high expectations for this laptop backpack.  I wasn't disappointed.  This well designed case is lightweight, with plenty of room for a laptop, cables, and accessories. The velcro on the adjustable straps is a nice touch, helping to keep them out of the way and organized. This case isn't flimsy, just light, which is nice for carrying around.  It's padded too, designed to protect your electronic investment.  The shoulder straps are very comfortable. There are lots of pockets, adding to the functionality. Comfort and functionality are what this backpack is all about.  I'm already using this product all the time, and it's holding up well. It's great to carry everything I need in a single backpack, rather than toting around a laptop case, and a backpack. A great product for an on the go lifestyle.
