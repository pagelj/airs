Ok, good for the price
For a roughly $4 product, this gps mount isn't too bad. Very adjustable, held my phone ( Droidx, with case ) very tightly, and I like that the flexible neck wasn't too flexible, meaning it generally stays in the pose you put it in. The downside was the product came damaged. The neck was not secured onto the base, and the space meant to hold it on the base was slightly cracked. This would not have been a big deal, however upon adjusting the neck, a whole side of the holding slot fell off. Fixed it with glue and duct tape, and it seems to be holding. I have yet to try it in my car, so I don't know about the suction cup/holding power. I assume it works well, as I have tested the suction cup out on windows and it held well. On the whole, definitely worth about the $4-$5 I spent on it, I would have been very disappointed if I had paid more.
