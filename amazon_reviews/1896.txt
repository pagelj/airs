I bought this machine in October 2010 to replace my Mr. Coffee EMC-160 that broke during a move.  I wanted to upgrade to an espresso machine with BAR Pump.  This machine makes a great cup of expresso and I use it every morning to make a mocha.  What I love about both Mr. Coffee Expresso Machines is that they are easy to use and make great coffee.  I am disappointed to report that about 3 months a go the frothing wand started dripping as soon as it is turn on and the water holder leaks at the bottom. Not sure what I am going to do now - buy another one since it makes good coffee or try another brand.
