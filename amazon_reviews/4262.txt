FREEZES AND FREEZES OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN!
Let me just start by saying that I like Panasonic products. I own two large Panasonic plasma monitors and three Panasonic blu-ray dvd players, including this model. They all work fine, except for this particular model. This model freezes up way too much. It freezes when I watch a movie on a dvd, and it freezes when I watch movies on Netflix. It is extremely annoying having to re-start a movie over-and-over-and over-and over-and over again, and again. STAY AWAY from this particular model.
