I must say, this is by far the best trash can I've ever owned.  I previously had a circular stainless steel trash can and the first thing I noticed when I got the new one is that I can fit more trash in it because of it's rectangular shape! We've gone from emptying the trash daily to about every 3 days now.  I like that it opens automatically, eliminating cross contamination.  Overall, a great buy!
