5 star product!  minus a star for the price
I looked at many covers for the paperwhite and decided to go with the original.  I am very happy with my decision.  The PW sits inside of the cover with rubber edges to keep it in place.  It's pretty snug so the PW won't have a chance to fall out.  Without using elastic bands on each corner to hold the device (seen in other covers), the PW looks sleek and clean.  The cover adds a little weight but it's keeping my PW well protected.  The magnet function makes it so convenient.  I love not having to push the button every time I use the device to wake it up or put it to sleep.  Just open the cover and it's ready to go!  The fuchsia color is accurate and adds a little personality to my PW.  Took off a star for the price.. but overall, it's a 5 star product!
