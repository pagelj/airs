Simple clever device
I was looking for a mount to hold my iPhone 5 for GPS navigation.  Fits the bill.  Simple to operate:  snap closure when you press the iPhone into the device -- holds it snugly -- and two buttons on opposite sides release it.  Allows access to charging cable and earphone jack while mounted.  "Sticky" suction cup is rock solid.  Controls to rotate and change viewing angle are simple to use.  Great device.
