Worked fine at first. Now that it is past the time to return it it has stopped working!
Looking for a flip phone that others said worked well I bought this one. I liked it at first. Now in February after buying it in November it has suddenly started strangely quickly using up all power and crashing when I use it to make a call. It will keep power as long as I do not use it! Apparently there is not way to return it now? I will not buy from this seller, BLUTEKUSA. COM, INC, again. Verizon Blackberry Flip 8230 Pearl Cell Phone Silver CDMA ONLY
