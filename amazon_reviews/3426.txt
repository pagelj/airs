Needs assembly and weak
The product must be assembled. Easy to do, but odd. The tilt requires you to adjust a screw, however it is too weak to hold the angle with that one weak screw. Plus it is hard to get your hand in behind the tv to adjust. Your TV will hang tilted down, the only thing stopping it is when the bottom of the tv touches the wall. That will give you a two-three inch gap on top. Also, it mounts very tight to the wall, only a 1/2" gap. So if you plug your tv into a socket behind the wall, you will have an issue, the plug will interfere with the mount.
