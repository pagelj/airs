Pentax WG-1 GPS camera
This camera float works perfect with my Pentax WG-1 GPS camera.  Pentax says camera with better & memory card weighs 5.9 ouces.  I tried in a pool before we went snorkeling.  In pool camera also had a web type strap with a caribiner clip making it even heavier.  Float still floated camera at the surface.  With caribiner cip off camera weighed less so i knew there would be no problems.  Plus there is a release clip.  Strap can stay on camera and yellow float can be taken off for cleaning/drying or for when camera isn't used in water.  Works perfect and looks alot better than the Pentax float thats about 4X wider. or other floats.
