This Toaster I have had for 2 months now and I use it 3 days a week,it is attractive and solidly built. Even spread on the toast in terms of crisping it. I am not sure what the other reviewers thought they were getting, Maybe a ten lbs brick that they could throw around and generally not take care of but in my opinion this sucker works great and is exactly whatI will be recomending to anyone in my family.
