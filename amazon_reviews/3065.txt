This toaster isn't an eyesore on the counter and my seven year old now comes up with many recipes involving toasted bread or waffles.  Our old toaster broke a year ago and I was using the oven broiler, it just became one of those purchases you mean to get around to but is always forgotten.  As a homeschooling mom I know now that the toaster is a wonderful way to introduce cooking in a relatively safe way with a responsible child who will follow instructions.  Not just a toaster, also a learning device:)
