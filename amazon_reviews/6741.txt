What an awesome product! It was a little pricey, but I had a gift certificate and free shipping, so that made it easier. No hands to open the lid and no feet to open the lid.... it just opens!! Only one negative..... it's very sensitive. I had to turn it in a different direction because it kept opening each time I walked by. Even my hubby loves it and he doesn't get too excited about anything like that. Besides the functionality, it's quite a conversation piece! You'll love it!
