Could be better
Today I received the Notebook cool pad. I did a basic study on this product before ordering this product and was not having great expectations. But I am very much disappointed, after seeing the product. I feel the design could have been better. The cooler has 3 fans and is sliding towards the front. This means, the cooler is about an inch high behind and about a centimeter high in the front. Because of this when I kept the laptop on the pad, due to the laptop wight, the fan on the front touched the floor and stopped working. I ended up with just 2 fans working now. Also the material is cheap plastic with all the wiring exposed. I do not expect this product to work(even 2 fans) more than 2 months. I wish I had spent few extra bucks and went for a better product
