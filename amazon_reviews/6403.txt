This weird little thing makes espresso that rivals that of our local coffeeshops... and that's saying a lot here in the Pacific Northwest. Of course, you have to buy good coffee, and you have to be consistent to get what you want, but that's easy. I make the espresso (two parts water to two scoops of coffee as directed) and then often water it down into an americano. Perfect. Exactly what I want, every time.
