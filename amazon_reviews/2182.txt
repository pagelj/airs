We ordered this vacuum as a cheap replacement for our cheap Eureka.  After using it for a few days, I think we'll be replacing it with another cheap Eureka.  It seems to be a fine vacuum for short carpet and it has great suction, but we have brand new thick carpet and after leaving the vacuum in one place for an extended period of time to use the hand tools, the carpet has been damaged in a few places.  Our Eureka had the option to turn off the roller, and other vacuums provide a height adjustment.  On the plus side, it is very light and easy to carry when vacuuming the stairs; however, on the down side, the hose is very short and you have to do something to keep it from tipping if you reach very far. PRO:- Lightweight- Long cord- Good suctionCON:- Short hose- Intense roller brush that cannot be turned off
