Waiting for the other shoe to drop
I'm mid-50s and have been reading romances for 30+ years. So, I've pretty much read every plot line there is. Maid for Love has something a bit different, but I spent most of the book waiting to see what the someone-loses-someone/resoluion was going to be. This meant I paged through the book pretty quickly. It was sort of like a Weight Watchers dessert -- sweet, but artificial. That being said, the bulk of the book was story (rather than softcore porn), so that's a plus from my point of view. Marie Force is a good writer and her story was clear and characters well developed. So, I bought the next book in the series, hoping for a bit better pacing.
