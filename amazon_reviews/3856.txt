Good Cable, Bad Seller
I bought this cable from Eforcity, the cable works great in my 1080p Plasma with an upconverting DVD player. For digital is the same cheap or expenssive cables, but the shipment was horrible with Eforcity (took 13 days), try to buy the cable with another company and you will enjoy a perfect digital image in yor HDTV.
