Economical but with Limitations
I miss having a range finder but knew this up front. The quality of the photos is good but not an improvement over a similar  Canon I bought 7 years ago.  I like the rechargeable battery pack and efficient design. I am not sorry I bought it but sometimes I think I should have purchased a better class of camera with more sophisticated features.
