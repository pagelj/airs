Doesn't work, and they're not willing to do the right thing
We got one, and the video never worked. Reported it to Philips, who sent a new one (in 10 days). The audio for that one never worked. Called again, and they refused to expedite shipping beyond the 10 days for what would be our third unit. And refused to put someone on the phone who could make a decision. No one had a reason, other than "policy." Ridiculous.
