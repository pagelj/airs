Meh
I downloaded this for free and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.  It's been a while since I've read a romance, so maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind for it.  But this is one of those books where you have to suspend all thoughts of reality for it to work.  The characters are completely unbelievable.  The billionaire acts very unsophisticated for someone in his position.  The female protagonist waffles back and forth so much it's just annoying.  I will say that I liked the premise.  With better writing this could have been really fun to get into (ala Pretty Woman) - hence the 2 stars instead of 1 -  but it just really fell flat.  Everything happened practically instantaneously.  Every time I'd get a spark of reader interest going, the author would blow it with the girl acting like an idiot again.  I guess I like a woman with brains in my stories...
