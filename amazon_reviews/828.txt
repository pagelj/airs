"For Little Engineers. . ."
Oh man; I must reconsider those excellent books that I rated 5 stars, because THIS book is an actual super-star for me. I've never read anything like it. It will not appeal to those who have no interest in science, or engineering, or extended struggle punctuated by many life-threatening events.  An astronaut is abandoned on Mars when his crew mistakenly believes he was killed in a weather-related flurry of damages. I have recommended it to my previous co-workers at JPL and Wenner-Gren Labs.  (BTW, my title is a quote from Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales.")
