Quick, easy, nice pictures
I have a very nice camera that I enjoy ... however it is hard to travel with.  I bought this camera to stick in my purse, so I could have a camera when I traveled.  It has now gone around the country with me and worked out quite well.  It takes nice pictures of people and nature.  The zoom works quite well.  Transferring pictures to my computer is easy.  I am very pleased with this camera. (and I struggle with technology ... but this is even easy for me!)
