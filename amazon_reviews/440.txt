The suction was fine but the brush just spun around, it didn't reach down into my carpet and move the dirt.  Not low enough.  Then after just a few uses, like others mentioned in their reviews, as I was twisting the bottom of the suction hose like you have to do to switch modes, the cheap plastic at the end of the tube just broke in two places.  This vacuum cleaner would be okay if you need a cheap vacuum at a cabin or wherever,one that is not going to have heavy use or do deep carpets.... but If you have one of these or buy one of these, be sure to treat the hose with kid gloves or it will break.
