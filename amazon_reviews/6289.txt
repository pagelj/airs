Very compact
I LOOOOVE this charger! Its quite compact, neat and driver-friendly as opposed to having a car charger with curly, tangly wires get tangled up in my car's arm rest!!! To add to this, any devices with a USB can be dharged using this one charger! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! Awesome idea on manufacturers behalf!!
