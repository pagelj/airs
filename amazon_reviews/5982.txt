What you would expect for the price
This cover was about what you would expect for the price.  It did provide some protection for the back of the phone and helped you grip the phone easier.  There was no screen cover and it does not easily slip into the belt clip holster.  You have to pull out on the side clips to get it to slide into place.  It was okay to use while I tried to decide which of the expensive cases to go with.  I decided on a Lifeproof case and am now using that.
