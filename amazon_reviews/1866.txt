Thanks for Pandering To Me
This book is a series of pop-references surrounding geek culture, hung on a competent quest novel plot.  It is shameless in its pandering, and its plot contains all the appropriate tropes for a quest plot.  It is relatively mindless entertainment, and is not a great science fiction book in the sense that it does not provide any original perspective on human condition, social progression, or near future events.  It is just SO MUCH FUN!!! I have this book on Audible in addition to my hard-copy version.  I have read it once, but I've listened to it four or five times already.  It is just the most delicious bowl of brain candy I have read since Snow Crash and Diamond Age.  It is a gloriously wonderful waste of time, like watching Princess Bride or Dark Crystal. If you think Steve Wozniak and Rush are equivalent benchmarks of awesome, get happy chuckles when you think of Pop-rocks or Ultraman, remember the first character you ever rolled for D&D, or occasionally reminisce about grabbing high-score in your local pizza joint's game room, you have a very, very good chance of enjoying this book.
