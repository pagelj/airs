I had an older model for three years and the battery finally pooped out so I bought this one to replace it.  I love that it is more energy efficient (basically stops eating power after charge is achieved), and that it holds the charge for a longer time.  It is perfect for hardwood floors, works fine on rugs too, but I use it mostly for my hardwood and save the super sucking of the rugs for my larger, heavier vac.  I love, love, love this vacuum.  It's light weight, cordless and works great.  BUY IT!
