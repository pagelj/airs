Dell Inspiron i15R-1632sLV 15-Inch Laptop (Silver)
I purchased this laptop after returning a similar ACER version which was defective. The Inspiron is a typical DELL product, very good but not outstanding. This particular machine has no defects that I can tell; it has a chicklet keyboard like the ACER, but the keys are a bit more raised and rounded, and I find I can touch-type on it without too much difficulty (I do not like chicklet keyboards!) One property of this machine that astounded me was the weight... this is no feather-light item--it seems to weigh a ton, figuratively speaking. The screen definition is excellent, but this particular unit can't be set low enough in brightness to make viewing comfortable under all conditions. I recommend it as a compromise between a fixed-location unit and a true portable. One can carry it in an appropriate satchel, but it is not a unit that one would use on the subway or in an airplane... it is too massive.
