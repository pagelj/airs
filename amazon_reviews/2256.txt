FAST as all hell but IQ is nothing to brag about
I got two of these for professional use:The first one was squeeking when the sensor was being cleaned. It drove me crazy and I returned it. I got my replacement and it's silent. DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! -If something feels off about your camera when you get it, look it up! It could be normal and it could be a major flaw. Know before it's too late so you can get a "good" copy. Pros:BEST BODY CONSTRUCTION ON THE MARKET!!!!8FPS!!!! (Great for wildlife/Action)AMAZING Servo AF. GREAT video. AMAZING outdoor performance. Feels great in my hands, very sturdy. Weather sealingIn camera RAW (can save time when prepping a shoot with white balance etc.)3 custom user image profilesGreat layout, very intuitive for canon users. Cons:Not the sharpest camera. After many side by sides with my Rebel Xti, the IQ is pretty much the same unfortunately. I am keeping my old 5D for portraits and landscape/lowlight. Not so hot in Low light. Try not to push too much above 1000. Decent noise control but it shouldn't need to control it in the first place (Ideally)Battery grip doesn't match camera grip ergonomics at all. Battery life could be a touch better. It suffers from being too awesome sometimes. Bottom line:I am NOT sending it back. I am excited to use it for what it was designed for. If you are strictly a landscape/portrait photographer, get a different camera. If you are a wildlife photographer, you will LOVE this. If you are thinking that a better camera will make you a better photographer, save your money and try cooking. If you have the money and want a great all around camera, go for it!
