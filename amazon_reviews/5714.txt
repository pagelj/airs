This is a GEM of a buy!
Very intuitive, easy and practical to use.  I purchased this for my wife, at her request for an iPad.  After using it for a few days, she is over joyed that I opted for the Galaxy Tab 2 over the iPad.  I felt the same way, I find it very frusterating to use my daughters iPad or iPhone, I can not put my finger on it, but Android devices seem to be much more user friendly.
