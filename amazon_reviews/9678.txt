Exactly What I Expected
It's always nice to get exactly what you ordered. I thought that this laptop would have everything I needed to do my work as an accountant and it did. And for under $500, it was worth every penny. It replaced a crappy Compaq laptop that was only 3 years old and already falling apart so I couldn't be more pleased.
