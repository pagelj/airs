I was a little worried about this item since I found it hard to believe that Icould get a good poached egg out of it and in only a few minutes.  This is reallya great gadget.  I like my eggs soft though and it has taken some trial and error onhow much water to put into the egg cooker to get the eggs the way I want them, but itcooks them great and to have poached eggs and toast done in a few minutes when you have a hurried morning and not much time to eat is a pleasure. I have to say I'm gladI bought this.
