Low Light Rocks, great working camera
We are wedding and portrait photographers that wanted two identical camera bodies for weddings.  I had a choice of a few more pro lenses or (2) D300's to replace our D70's.  Last year we photographed 16 weddings and over 100 on-location portrait sessions with them and they have performed flawlessly.  Low light of certain venues or churches are where the D90 shines. Still playing with video and I can't compare it to others but it seems to work well in creating fusion videos that our clients love.  This year we are upgrading to D700's but from my perspective save your money buying D300's and buy good glass.  The D90's Rock.
