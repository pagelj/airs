Good lense
Too good to be true?!?  I thought so, as all the other lenses I priced were in the $400-500 range, but I am really glad that I read some of the reviews.  I don't know that I would use this for sports, etc, cause it does not seem fast enough for that; but scenery and still shots look great.
