Perfectly happy amateur
I am enjoying using my J1 with the 10-30 and 30-110mm lens.  I haven't played around with it for long, but I bought it for ease of use and quality in the automatic setting, in low light and with moving objects (I have 2 toddlers).  So far it has performed far better than my Olympus compact SLR and almost as good if not better than my older Nikon D90.  My only regret so far is that the photos seem to have a slightly darker and yellower tint than what the screen - or real life shows you.  I am wondering if that is fixable with settings... UPdate:  Another thing that just happened is that after snapping about 10 shots consecutively with the flash I got a warning "flash is hot" and had to close it!  Uh oh.... Not sure about this...
