Perfect flash for Nikon DSLR
Even though this is a smaller flash, the pictures taken with it are great. I have the Nikon SB600, a larger flash. For most situation the result from this flash and the SB600 is the same.  This flash is lighter and more portable so I will be using this more often then the SB600. This flash is so light that I leave the flash on the camera. So I get great pictures more often with this smaller unit than the bigger SB600. I learned that a flash that you can use more often is more important than the size/power of the flash. The best thing about this flash is the bounce feature. You can use flip the flash head 60 to 90 degree. This give you a nice picture with natural light instead of the bright flash. This feature is going to make your picture much nicer than without an external flash. You can never get this kind of picture with the built in flash.
