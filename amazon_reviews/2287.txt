buh bye cable
Subscriptions are needed like Hulu plus $8/mo and Netflix $8/mo but so much cheaper than cable. I bought the NHL package too because I am a east coast fan living in the west. Be wary of blacked out games in your area when buying sports packages. The free channels are OK but you have to sit through the same commercials over and over. No way to FF them either.
