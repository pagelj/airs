Olympus PEN EPL1
I love this camera. I was a noob when it came to film and high quality digital photography so this camera has really helped me get started. I am still learning, but I feel much more confident since I have been using this. The image quality is superb at 12.3 megapixels. You have so many effects and lighting options to choose from. I love being able to take it wherever and make a high quality short film as well. :)
