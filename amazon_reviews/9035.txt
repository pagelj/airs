Best Price with Great Looks!
Just received my purse and it is fabulous!  I shop everywhere for purses from Macys to Ross.  The price is more than reasonable and the quality is better than expected! Love all the extra pockets but, not in love with the zipper enclosure for the main purse. Such a fun and good-looking purse for very little money.  Oh - and it arrived four days early!  Just when I needed a little "pick-me-up"!  P. S.  It's more brown than black; still looks good!
