Second time buying this
This is the second time buying this product, not because it is "just that good" but because others are "just that bad" (even when they cost only 3 dollars with shipping.  I like this unit because it works, and it is built to near OEM quality (don't let the Motorola logo fool you, they wouldnt pass this off as full oem quality).  This will outlast the other cheap ones on here, but its nothing impressive.  One thing, if you are pilot type, or are the kind of driver that is in-tune (aka intelligent) and turn down your interior lights at night so that you can see further, and with better depth, this thing will annoy you to no end, the blue see-through portion glows blue.  It's great for teenagers who like shiney things, but for those with IQ's over 60, it is distracting and blinding.  Your best bet is to put something over it, and/or aim (yes aim) it away from you toward the passenger.  It is a really stupid design, but in the company of other really terrible products, its probably one of the better ones.
