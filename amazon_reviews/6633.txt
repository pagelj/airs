Brings home the bacon
For a B-movie, this was not bad over all. The story was engaging and not total hollywood shlok. While it was no Star trek or 5th element, it was one of the better low buget sci-fi movies. This was more of a B+ movie then just a B-movie. A little bigger buget and maybe this could have gone some where... who knows. Over all I think this is a fun film, and you should give it a try.
