Great manual control with all the digital perks!
I have only had the camera for a few days & I'm so happy I opted for this one.  My last camera was the Sony Cybershot & before that a Nikon Coolpix (1 of the early models), & while they are good cameras there were flaws that I couldn't get around.  My favorite setting to play with is lighting, & I've found that most new models of digital cameras have too bright of a flash & can't manage a good photo w/out it (including many times w/a tripod). After using this one for only a few days, I'm ready to swear off "compact" digital cameras.  This camera is a perfect option for someone looking to go digital but retain the control levels of a manual camera.  It's slightly larger than most compact cameras but not to its demise in my opinion.  The weight feels good in your hands, & so far I am pleased with the quality of this camera all around.  Of course every picture doesn't turn out perfect, but that's the point of having control over your settings.  If all you're looking for is non-blurry snapshots, perhaps look elsewhere, but in terms of photography, for beginners amateurs, or enthusiasts (me), this is a great choice!
