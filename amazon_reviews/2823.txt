Great camera, amazing quality
This camera is great. I got it as an upgrade for my point-and-shoot Canon in mid December and I am pretty happy with it so far. It starts immediately and it is extremely light which was important to me. It fits in a purse! (but make sure you put it in a camera bag first)I ordered it with the free supersaver shipping and it arrived in 3 days via UPS, so that was pretty nice. Overall, high quality pictures and easy to operate. I recommend it.
