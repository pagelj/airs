Pleased with my 5th digital camera
I started digital photography in 2005 with an Olympus C765-uz, 4 mp with which I got some of the best shots I've ever taken, especially with the super macro.  Despite later adding two Canon dslr's and a Panasomic Lumix, I was still looking for a higher megapixel version of the 765 and have found it in the 800uz.  Things I like about the 800 uz are its size and feel, its comparatively quick shutter response, the ease of menu usage, much higher mp's, and its flexibility from quality super macro to 30x zoom all in one camera.  Compared to the older Olympus and the Panasomic, visibility with the view screen is much better in bright light which makes up somewhat for the lack of a viewfinder.  Things I don't like are having to recharge batteries in the camera (no external battery charger provided), and the shorter battery life compared to any of the above-mentioned cameras, at least for my first usage.  Fortunately, the one I got came with 3 batteries.  Great camera for the price. Following up after about 6 months of usage, I have additional comments.  The camera continues to be excellent for scenes, panoramas, and reasonable zooms with good light, especially of things like butterflies and dragonflies.  Photo quality, of birds for example, at the highest zoom is usually fair to poor.  I've found a dilemma in usage in that you have to re-set almost everything every time the camera is turned off, but if you leave it on in anticipation of subjects, then the battery goes rather quickly.  I have found myself going back to the smaller Panasonic and larger Canon more often in recent months, although I would still favor this camera for its diversity when I'm on longer hikes and not wanting to weigh myself down with a dslr and its lenses.
