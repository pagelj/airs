Love the long length
I really like this as I recently bought the logitech blue tooth keyboard for Ipads and this works perfect to set on my night stand by the bed as I keep it plugged in all the time and use it an big digital Alarm clock. (Don't need my glasses to see in the middle of the night) ha! The extra length gave me plenty of room to reach the wall socket and keep the Ipad over on my side of the bed.
