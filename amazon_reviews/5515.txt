The machine is nice looking but the biggest issue is that the coffee does not come out very hot after brewing.... which I believe is why it does not taste very flavorful. I bought this based on the reviews but only a few of the many reviews point this out. I missed it when I was buying this but I have to tell the true coffee lovers out there that this is not the coffee maker for you. This arrived yesterday and I plan on returning it tomorrow.
