good cables for the price
I bought this, along with a coupler, yet to arrive, to connect my laptop to my 40" Westinghouse LCD tv. I hooked up one of the cables to see how it looks and performs well. I've used to watch videos that I downloaded on iTunes and it saves the strain of watching it on a little iPod Touch screen or a 15" laptop monitor. as far as the price is concerned, $10 is a heck of deal for two HDMI cords, while a similar package on Best Buy's website costs $34.99 for essentially the same thing. Shipping was quick too; two-day free shipping (part of Amazon Prime) saved a bit more cash.
