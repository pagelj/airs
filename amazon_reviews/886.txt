"Unbelievable"
Redeeming Love, is a hard story to read and very unbelievable that any person would forgive a spouse the rank sins committed against themselves and their relationship. But this is a mirrored story of our relationship with a loving, forgiving and redeeming God who continues to love us while we are unfaithful to his mercy, grace and forgivness.
