SO EXCITED!
Finally found a toaster oven that is large enough to actually cook something besides toast or pizza! Cant say enough about it.... looks very nice sitting on counter. Very well made, high quality product. Make sure you measure where you want to put this oven because it is large. I bought this for my RV, ovens in RV's are worthless! In fact seller needs to advertise in RV books/section..... a must have for RV/camper owners.  **UPDATE**  Still love my oven, I do have a complaint..... I was shocked to discover that the oven has NO LIGHT on the inside :(  While I do love it, it was just a BIG disappointment.
