Great Toy Kids Love it Even Broke
I was looking for a replacement for our cell phones when my now almost 4 year old was younger.  This phone was a huge hit.  It was not a replacement for his fascination with our phones, but did give him tons of fun, and is now at our local YMCA with only some of it's buttons still working and I see kids playing pretend with it all the time. I plan to purchase a second one for my now 8 month old for his first birthday.  While it was still in our home he even loved it. Now that is what the kids think of it.  I think it is simple, and had boring colors and graphics.  It is like looking at an old apple computer as fall as graphics go and the screen is in black and white, but then I only paid like $12 for it at toys r us, so I can't expect too much. It teaches number recognition and counting.  My son was very quick to pick up on the numbers. We have a few other electronic phones, one from vtech and one generic brand, but this is the one the kids go for even though the others are more brightly colored.
