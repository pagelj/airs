Good for basics, not for professionals
This lens is appealing for its wide to zoom abilities. BUT it has a very VERY small focus. The focus seems to move around constantly, especially if there is any kinds of movement. It seems good for still life but for people it does not work well. I tried shooting a wedding and  a portrait with it and found many of the images were out of focus and while I was working with it the focus kept moving all over the place.
