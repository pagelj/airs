Awestruck
I have purchased many, many, many things from Amazon however this is my first time I have placed a review. I will make this short. This machine is amazing for $249. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever used. The touchpad is awesome. The speakers are loud. Not what an audiophile would appreciate however my 3 year old can hear his youtube stuff in a room with other noise. I like to use multiple browser windows versus a single browser window with mutilple tabs. I have 10 windows open with each having maybe 2 to 4 related tabs and I have no slow down at all. The quality is very good and solid. The screen is plenty bright. This thing is a crazy good deal.
