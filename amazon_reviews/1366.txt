I am so grateful to have gotten this kindle
I already have the kindle fire 7" and love it to death, I take it with me everywhere, it's always in my purse. Now for the 8.9 wireless, I love the size but for different reasons, I read mostly and play the games I can without internet on the kindle fire 7", but the kindle fire 8.9 I can now watch movies, go on the internet, play games that require the internet, so it's kinda like a small laptop without a dvd player at half the size. For example I am planning on spending a lot of summer days at wet and wild in las vegas so I need the internet, so I'm not just stuck reading, but can also check my facebook or watch a movie.  I do have a smart phone but the screen is to small for my eyes, so that's my opinion of the fire HD 4G. I also bought the Bear wireless keyboard, and cover which is really nice if you hate typing on the screen and a waterproof cover to protect my kindle from water. Going to be a great summer in Vegas!!!
