Great man bag, but poor stitching
Extremely handy "man bag" for the pool and errands. I got this because I've had and loved my bigger Ful sling for my note- and netbooks for a couple of years now. Problem is the stitching that joins the shoulder strap to the clip separated because it was poorly done. I'm going to install a rivet or a snap to make sure it doesn't happen again. If I weren't biased by my very favorable impression of my other Ful product I'd probably be less charitable about this one.
