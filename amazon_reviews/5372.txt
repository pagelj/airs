They were good while they lasted...
I took off the original cushion to replace it with the larger one, but it was impossible to get on. Maybe my hands are just too big, but after trying for a few minutes the cushion ripped. I think the product's image is misleading because the part you insert into your ear is more of an oval than a sphere.
