Never received what I ordered.
OK, this was an inexpensive product and being cheated out of this small amount of money isn't going to bankrupt me. Nonetheless, I definitely feel cheated; the vendor used FedEx to ship to a PO Box.  (Why in the world would a vendor choose NOT to use the post office to deliver to a PO Box?)  FedEx claimed they delivered the package to my Post Office.  The Post Office says they didn't.  I'm out the money and can find no way to call Amazon, call the vendor, or get a resolution.  All of Amazon's on-line help says, in essence, "wait for your package to arrive."  It has arrived -- somewhere.  Most likely FedEx delivered to the wrong post office.  That doesn't help me, and an inability to call either Amazon of the vendor leaves me furious. If I had been told -- as I have in the past -- that the product could not be delivered to a PO box, I would have provided a street address.  I wasn't told.  Instead, the vendor used a Totally Inappropriate carrier.  The Totally Inappropriate carrier lost my package.  And Amazon doesn't provide a number, email address, or any other way to contact Amazon or to contact the vendor. Can you tell that I'm not at all happy about this?
