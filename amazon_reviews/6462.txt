Not worth the trouble
I bought a $30 dvd player from WalMart over three years ago and it still works. I bought this one from Amazon about 2 months ago and it already doesn't play. It skipped in the middle of nowhere on a perfect disc, and then when we took out the disc to check it, we put it back in and it said it was loading. It now says "No Disc" and doesn't play or even try to load anything. Amazon would not return this, so I called Coby directly. I called Coby and explained what had happened, and they said that if I could return it to them, they would exchange it. I asked if they knew how much shipping was and they said to include a $12 money order. So I verified with them, and they said I needed to pay shipping both ways. That's almost as much as I paid for it in the first place. I asked what they would do if the second one broke, and they said I didn't have to pay shipping for any more after the first one, but no matter how many times this happens, they will never exchange it for another product, only the exact same model. After reading all of the other reviews of the same thing happening to this model constantly and consistently, I decided that it's not worth the trouble.
