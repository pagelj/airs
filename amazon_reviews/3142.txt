Love this vacuum .......... best vacuum I've ever had! It really deep cleans my carpet very well, not to mention that it picks up cat hair very efficiently ...... I have 2 cats, & there's nothing worse than having a vacuum that only surface cleans, as the one I had before my new Hoover Platinum Upright,which didn't pick up my cat hairs very well. It's lightweight, easy to maneuver, especially if you have back pain, as I do. That is because the attachments come with a canister, & the tools are not on the upright. What I really like about the canister, is that if you need to extend the pole for the tools, you don't have to add on another pole, there's a button you push that will extend the main pole ....... so no extra pole to attach! The bagged upright is especially nice, as opposed to the bagless, as it is easier to empty (dust doesnt go flying all over the place). The only drawback is that the bags are a little pricey, but the vacuum is well worth having ......... also rated #1 in Consumer's Report!
