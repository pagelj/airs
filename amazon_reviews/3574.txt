Best backpack I have ever owned. Little tight on space.
I have mild scoliosis, backpacks have always been a pain for my.  This backpack is the first one to not bother me in the first 5 minutes of wearing it.  Whole back is padded and seems to shape to your back.  Laptop fits great and holds all the wiring I have for it. Only problem is it only fits 2 school book top with laptop inside and folders. Hopefully they come out with more ebooks for school.
