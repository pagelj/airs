Best phone yet!
We purchased this phone based on similar reviews and our current needs and guess what... we love it!  My favorite feature is the cellphone bluetooth option, once I located and enabled my device I can answer calls from my cell on the land line (not difficult to do).  I love being able to talk as long as I want to and my ear doesn't notice a change in temperature, and for those of you with neck issues no more cocking your head to the side trying to keep the phone from sliding down your shoulder and eventually hitting the floor.  Voice clarity is good and you can play messages direct from the phone all with a push of a button.  I highly recommend the device!
