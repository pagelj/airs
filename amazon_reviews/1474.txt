Would be a great design, had they tested it.
Although I would really like to give this stand three stars, I can't give it any more than two. The stand is beautiful, sturdy and does a good job of holding your laptop. Great. It contains a cable routing hole in the rear to keep cables neat. Smart. That said, this product suffers from a single major design flaw that just can't be overlooked: The cable routing hole is too small to accommodate the DVI plug from an apple Cinema display, despite the fact that the stand is shown *right next to* an apple cinema display in the product's retail packaging. FAIL. Fail. Fail. Fail. Did rain design not try to plug this into a single laptop accompanied by a Cinema Display before taking the design to the manufacturing step? Incredible. Sure, you can bypass the hole for the cinema display plug, but then what's the point in having the cable routing in the first place???
