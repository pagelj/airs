I have been slowly but surely inscreasing my Rada collection over time due to the EXTREMELY high quality of every single one of their products. This knife sharpener is the best thing since sliced bread lol!!! Not only will it put a keen razor's edge to almost all Rada cutlery, but, it also performs well on most all other thin bladed knives. I have some cheap steel that I had despaired of ever seeing sharp again... we're talking hard to cut butter with folks, the Rada sharpener put an edge on them that could shave hair. The only drawback I have found with this product is that I usually have to make frequent trips to the medicine cabinet for more band-aids soon after using it!
