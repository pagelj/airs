Awesome! Tried other types of mounts, this ROCKS
I travel quite a bit on long business trips and use my iPhone for GPS, music, and  calls extensively.  I tried vent mounts and lighter mounts and each had their challenges like being in a bad spot visually, not stable, blocking air vents for defrost/heat, and distracting while driving. This mount was super easy to install and in the perfect spot for GPS / music use being the same place as my radio dashboard, I'm already accustomed to visually.  Also, making use of my ancient CD player is brilliant.  The simple things in life that make you happy... Thanks!
