Powergen wall charger
I ordered the Powergen wall charger several weeks ago and it works great.  My apple wall charger only works intermittenly and I decided to try a charger with more amperes.  The Powergen wall charger has been reliable and works well.  The only downside is that the blue LED is pretty bright at nighttime.
