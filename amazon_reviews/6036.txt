I purchased two of these, one for my apartment and one as a gift for my brother-in-law.  Mine lasted for about 6 months before it just stopped working mid-vacuum session.  I think the problem with mine is overheating.  It works for about 5 minutes then stops but i am able to start it up the next day but only for a couple of minutes.  My bro-in-laws stopped working even before mine.  We both have small apartments (mine with short office-like carpet and tile, his with hardwood floors and one large wool carpet)and neither of us have pets.  I was hoping we would get at least a year out of the vacuum, but unfortunately, was let down.  I will say that the suction and pick up, initially, is great and the vacuum cleans very very well.  In the end, if you are looking to buy, spend the extra money and buy something more dependable.
