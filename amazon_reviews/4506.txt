Love Love Love Them!!!
I purchased the same set many years ago, then never saw them again at the store. I was missing some pieces so went on a hunt for the set and had o luck in stores, even with different sets. Hated them all :)  I was sooooo happy to see these on Amazon!! They are exactly the same as my older set... which blended well as they kept their shine and don't scratch much. They actually seem a tad heavier, better. I love the combination of muted and shiny finish as the shine makes them bling while the muted part reduces fingerprints.  Very happy and would absolutely recommend. :)
