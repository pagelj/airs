Not worth your time
I couldnt read this book. I lost intrest within the second chapter. This was definatly ment for sixth and first semester seventh graders. It is not worth anyones time to read Bridesmaid Lotto. I honestly dont know why this book got any five stars. The only upside was it was easy to read if you could get past the spelling errors.
