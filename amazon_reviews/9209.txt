I was hopeful that this vacuum could replace my large, heavy canister vac, which I absolutely loathe to use.  But unfortunately, it cannot hold a charge long enough.  I got about half of my moderately large house vacuumed before it ran out of juice.  It ran full-steam for about 20 minutes, after which time I could hear it beginning to run down.  For about 5 minutes more, it continued to pick up dust, etc., pretty well.  But after a total of 25 minutes, it was finished. I needed double that amount of time to vacuum my entire house.  I knew I was asking a lot for this vacuum to run for an hour, but I was just hopeful that it could deliver.  It could not.  But I will give it credit for doing a pretty good job of picking up.  There was a lot of dust, etc. in it after the 25 minutes of vacuuming.  I guess I will just use this little vac for in-between touch-ups or small areas like our camper, which is probably what it is designed for in the first place.  Now I'm thinking about a Roomba.  Any comments?
