I always say to myself "No more appliances!" I don't have a ton of counter space, I hate cleaning them etc etc. But I still buy them because I love them. Panini makers, blenders, slow cookers, food processors. I love and use them all and I curse them all. This one is completely worth it. My sons and I eat poached eggs on toast 4X a week. That is a lot of poached eggs, and since my sons are younger than 4, I am constantly chasing them around and getting distracted which mean I am always and over or under cooking my eggs. Also, I am constantly washing all the parts of my egg poaching pot. Then came this toaster. It poaches the egg perfectly each time and times the bread so it toasts at the same time the egg is ready. The egg is the perfect size to fit on an english muffin. And the parts to wash are few, and easy to do. Much easier than washing the pot. Highly recommend!
