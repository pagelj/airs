I had heard so many positive reviews for this vacuum so after researching a number of vacuums, i decided to try this one out. PROS-*Awesome suction*clear bag-less section, reassuring that the suction is working well. CONS-*Extremely heavy, by the time i got to vacuuming the second room, my back hurt and i had to really push the vacuum to get it across the room*Pipe isn't really easy to move around. Because of the solid part, it doesn't really turn or move around*The first day i bought the vacuum, it already started making a grinding noise. The suction was still working,however the noise was so unbearable i had to stop vacuumingIn the end, i'm returning this vacuum and going back to buying a canister vacuum. Those are also annoying to haul around, but at least i won't have to break my back vacuuming one room.
