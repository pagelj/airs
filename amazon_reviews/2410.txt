Poor quality case
This case only gets points for good looks when it arrives. After only a few days of use all the edges started to show signs of wear - the sleek, matte finish was rubbing off and giving way to the cheap-looking plastic below. Also within a month or so the chrome framing around the camera came off. Overall, within a couple of months ofuse, the case looks old and worn out.
