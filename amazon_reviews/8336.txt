Awesome
So I just received my phone today. I was extremely excited it was everything I imagined and more the phone is amazing I love the features it's big it's just like I was expectin. I thought that I would have problems when inserting my t mobile sim into this phone but everything works just fine. The phone has a spot for your memory card and has 2 spots for SIM cards! In my package I receive the phone 2 batteries can you believe that a charger and headphones. I must say though that the charger I receive doesn't charge the phone but hey who cares you can use any other old charger. So far I'm enjoying this phone I'm actually on it right now writing this review. If you're looking for a big phone like the Galaxy know and you're trying to say some money I highly recommend you get this phone and I highly recommend this buyer because everything was great.
