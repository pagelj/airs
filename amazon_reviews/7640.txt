Excellent sub $200 HD DVD Player for 360 owners.
I purchased this item when it first came to market; however, I held off on my review until now so I could get a good feel for how this product performs. After watching most of what is currently available in HD-DVD to date I am nothing but impressed with this player.  The downside is you need to already own an Xbox 360 for it to be of any use, but when I bought it the lowest priced standalone player was $500, a huge value in my opinion.  The playback is smooth with no visible performance issues. I'd highly recommend this to anyone with a 360 looking to get into the Hi Def movie market.
