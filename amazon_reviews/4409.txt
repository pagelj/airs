does not fit canon sx40
After reading several reviews, I ordered this when I ordered my Canon SX40. This case does not properly fit this camera. When putting the camera in and out, it would tug on either the lens cap or the rubber eye rest. It fits, sort of, but just not well. I am returning it. (The case itself is okay, not overly padded, and the zipper seems cheap.) I bought this Lowepro case after looking at it in person and it fits great, with room for cords, battery, etc. A bit more money but worth it. Lowepro Rezo 110 AW Camera Bag
