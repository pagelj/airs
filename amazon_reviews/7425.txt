Accurate & Very Handy
The item was received fast. It looks very good but have one little sticky point around 2.5" on the scale. However this does not hamper the accuracy. I tested this with a calibrated Starret 6" caliper and it was dead accurate throughout the range. Cannot expect anything better. The zeroing feature at any point and instant conversion from inches to metric is very handy. Comes with a strong protective case. Overall this is an excellent product!!!
