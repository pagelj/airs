VideoSecu's Awesome Wall Mount
TV Mount is well built and was easy to put together.  The wall bracket goes together with 4 screws and 4 screws to mount the tv bracket to the tv.  8 screws total.  The built in bubble level was excellent addition.  The extra bubble level really isn't needed.  It took me all of 20 minutes to mount the TV to the wall.  I would recommend only making a 15/64" pilot hole in the stud, this ensures the lag bolt a good bite in the stud.  I highly recommend this mount.
