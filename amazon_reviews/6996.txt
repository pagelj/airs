Surprisingly beautiful machine!
I spent lots of time on various sites looking for a quality laptop with a 15.6 inch screen as a minimum.  After viewing and reviewing hundreds of models several times over, it came down to two machines for me.  I knew that I would either purchase this Toshiba or a comparable Asus unit.  Back and forth I went between the two looking at the pros and cons of each while trying to decide.  My belief is that, although the Asus would have been an excellent choice, this Toshiba was a better one mainly for two reasons: It had a better webcam and the quad-core AMD Vision 10 processor seemed more advanced than the Intel i5 dual-core featured in the Asus. I have been working with this new machine for two days now and find the keyboard to be excellent and pleasant to use.  Windows 8 will take some getting used to but I'm glad I have it and want to keep up with the times.  It seems fine overall.  I am happy with my choice and I'm sure there will be some kinks Toshiba and Microsoft will have to work out, as with anything new, but they will do so.  Purchasing from Amazon was great, the delivery, lightning fast, and I could not be happier!
