I love this Kindle Case Cover!!
I love this case! I am so glad I bought this case when I got my Kindle a few months ago. The cover seems to be sturdy and it is not bulky when I put it on my kindle. I like the elastic handle it has on the back of it, it makes it easier to hold on to the kindle, especially if you are in bed reading. I use the stand on it often while watching a movie. I think this product is well worth the money! I hope you enjoy your cover as much as I have enjoyed mine!
