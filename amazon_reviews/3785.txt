GREAT KNIVES!
I purchased this knife set after owning a faberware set (which was ok) for years.  This Ginsu set is "EXCELLENT" and "ATTRACTIVE LOOKING"!  These knives are nice and sharp and works well for someone who's looking for a reasonably priced, good cutley set.  I would definitely recommend it.
