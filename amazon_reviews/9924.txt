Is exactly what I ordered for an excellent price.  It records flawlessly.  Not much really to say about these things,  They work or they don't ,and they are not as fast as your hard drive or internal memory, so get over it.  They are what they are.  This one works.  There were no compatibility issues with camera or the computer.
