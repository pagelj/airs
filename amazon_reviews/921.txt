Great story
Really enjoyed this book. Extremely readable with the hero getting out of welfare and making his way upward through the armed services through guts and determination. This is one of the few books that I sat up and read past my bedtime so I could see how it ended. Hopefully this will grow into a series. Just downloaded the short story about Halley's journey in becoming a drop ship pilot. That will be today's reading.
