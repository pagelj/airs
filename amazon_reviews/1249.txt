Great Bag, Zipper is a little tough
Pros:- good laptop protection-Enough compartments to keep everything organized-Great for school or travel-COMFORTABLE- Enough space to carry my laptop binders and booksCons:- The zipper doesn't allow me to zip and unzip as smoothly as I would have liked.- it's kinda boxy and not too flexible but it doesnt look odd or anything.
