Not Really So Great After All
The icons are sometimes so sensitive, that it will touch itself and I just watch my minutes go by because it basically touching itself. And when I went in to Youtube. com mode, the screen becomes so small that it's so hard to watch a video with that tiny little screen, they fill up the rest of the screen with arrows and command icons. And the battery is dead after only 1 day or 2 days, you have to recharge again. And I've tried the camera and video features of the phone, the picture is very grainy and is very dark especially in low light situations. Not really thrilled after all owning this phone...
