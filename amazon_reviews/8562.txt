From the day I recieved it, one half of the toaster never worked. The lever wont latch to begin the toasting process. I need to send it back but I'm too busy and for $25.00 it doesnt seem to be worth it. Lesson learned... when you buy a cheap piece you get a cheap piece. Its over-comercialized import junk.
