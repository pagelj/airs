Nirvana!
I finally have THE all-around lens. Yes - it is noticeably heavier.  It took a couple of days for me to adjust to the additional weight around my neck and in my hand.  I've owned prior Nikon 18-200mm, as well as Tamron 18-270.  For me the extra reach makes this the ideal lens for walking around or situations where changing lenses is not convenient (For example, my trek into the Sahara desert is why I initially got my first 18-200).  While waiting to receive this, I read a lot about suspected loss of IQ.  If so, it is barely noticeable.  I will, of course, continue to use my faster 35 and 60mm primes and 70-200mm f/2.8, but if I can't carry much, this is THE lens.  Worth every penny!
