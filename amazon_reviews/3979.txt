Excellent Battery Pack, Has Yet to Run Out!!
I LOOOOOOVEEEEEE this thing.  It is honestly one of my top 5 gadgets ever.  I am an avid poker player, especially tournaments.  I also have a power hungry Android Droid Incredible and the connection at the casino can be spotty at times, depleting my battery even faster.  For those of you that don't play tournament poker, they can be long days, somtimes 14hours of play.  This baby has NEVER been fully discharged my me.  My battery will hit 25% in about 3 hours because of the constant texting, IMing and twittering Im doing to keep myself from dying of boredom and this external battery will charge my battery (slowly) back to 100% and keep it there for the entire time I play, again, its been as long as 14 hours.  Without this battery, my device would be dead after 4.5.  Honestly, if you are going to be traveling to a location where you wont have easy access to power, BUY THIS, you wont be disappointed.
