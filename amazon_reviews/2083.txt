These knives are super sharp! I am not sure if I was just used to using very dull pieces, but when I use these to slice my tomatoes and veggies.. wow! A huge, very pleasant difference. They are light weight, and I was concerned that they could not deliver, but I promise you these work great. Get them if you are looking for a fairly cheap price for good quality, you wont regret it.
