Sweet camera
Rated a best buy on Consumer Reports. Bought this for my wife. She loves it. It takes great pictures in regular and low light situations and it fits in her purse. She also has a big Cannon SLR camera but now that one stays at home and she uses this little compact camera for most of her picture taking.
