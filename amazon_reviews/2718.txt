We bought this can for it's appeal as a "dog-proof" trash can. We have a large Labrador that kept getting into the trash, and this trashcan deterred him for only a little while. It does have a couple of critical design flaws though that make it not work so well for this application. For one, if the can is tipped over, the internal bin can unseat and jam the butterfly doors open. Secondly, the butterfly doors are not as tight as they need to be to prevent being pried open by an animal. If the second issue is corrected I believe the first would become a non-issue, but I docked it a star for that, a $160 trashcan should be a tighter build. Other than that it's a great trashcan and appears to be built with good quality and confidence inspiring internals.
