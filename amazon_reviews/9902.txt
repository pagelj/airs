Upgraded from previous IPhone 4 version, yet downgraded
I purchased the original Iphone Otterbox Defender series for my phone, and I recently bought my wife this case for her Iphone.  When comparing the pros vs cons:Pro:The silicone on this case does not stick.  Sometimes in my pocket the original Defender series would stick to my pocket, and it would be difficult to retrieve.  I would have to yank and pull my pocket inside out to retrieve. Same impact protect as original.  I have dropped my original off a 20 ft scaffolding and it barely put a dent in the case. If you are rough on phones and want an Iphone, I would not pick any other case.  This one is by far the best protection that I have seen for Iphones. Con:Wish there was some sort of protection for the cameras in this new version.  Original version did have protection, a piece of clear plastic over camera area so it could not get scratched on either the front or back side. I personally do not like the clip on either.  I get it caught on things I pass by, but it may just be me. I did not like on either version the top tab around the audio jack area.  I personally cut mine off because it was ripping the rest of the silicone wrap on the top left corner.  That area is very fragile if you plug in headphones a lot, or turn the phone to silent.
