Suction was good for carpet (though we don't have any pets). But one flaw kills it completely. The belt that drives the brush. EVERY time the brush sucks something in: a shoelace, a strap of a backpack or else - it burns down the belt before you reach the switch! The first belt I ordered from the Hoover's web site did not fit the model- it was loose. $8 per belt with shipping. And you have to wait for a week - they are not fast with shipping. In addition, changing the belt is a dirty and annoying procedure. I tried avoiding shoelaces and such, but it continued to happen to me. I've burned 4 belts in half a year. I had Dyson All Floors before and it didn't burn though it did suck a piece of rope. I believe the belt issue is related to the design of the belt driver mechanism. Cleaning the dust container is also a cause of frustration - you have to use a long ruler or similar to get the stuck compacted dust out, but it seems it is a common problem for all vacuum cleaners of this design (including Dyson). After only 6 months, we are now looking for another vacuum cleaner - and it is not going to be one from Hoover.
