Cover is a good fit for the kindle
Cover is a great tight fit, but I have found that once it is in the cover I have not found a way to take it out. as yet? Its great as a safety angle, because when you shut the cover over you know that iti s safe and will not be damaged. I am not certain that I want to take it out of the cover but sometimes I feel that it may well have been a lot easier to hold when reading if it wasnt in a cover. I am not too sure about that as yet, because I have not been able to take it out of the cover as it is certainly a very tight fit. So, buy the cover as it does protect the screen, that is a must, Dont be like me and think it could be better without the cover, as it does have its advantages thats for sure.
