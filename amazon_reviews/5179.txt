This is the first time that I have felt compelled to leave a product review.  If I could have given it zero stars, I would have done so.  I purchased this toaster, took it home, plugged it in, and inserted the bread.  When I pushed the lever down, it popped right back up.  I tried the other side; the same thing happened.  Neither of the levers would stay down, and the heating elements, of course, never came on.  I returned it for another one.  That toaster did appear to work until the toast popped up and only one side of the bread was toasted.  Back that one went, and I brought home a third one (No one can say that I didn't give it a fair shot!)  Now the THIRD toaster did the same thing.  That was it for me.  I took it back, and now I'm researching toasters! Sheesh!  Who would think that you would actually have to research a toaster!  Several years ago, I purchased a 4-slice Phillips toaster from Target on amazon. com for $29.99, and that was the best toaster we ever had.  If Phillips still made it, I would buy another one.
