Bought two, both bit the dust within 18 months
We bought two kindle fires for our daughters for Christmas. They are not used a ton since we restrict use to weekends only. One of them started having problems charging because the port started getting loose ( just like everyone else's complaint) but then the other one started to swell from the inside out. Apparently the battery.  (no exposure to heat or water!) I noticed some other reviewers had the same problem. I have one of the first iPads and to even compare it to a kindle fire is hilarious. Just save a little longer and get an iPad!!
