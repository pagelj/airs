Farberware Toaster
I am a follower of Cook's Illustrated and they recommended the farberware toaster and so when my daughter said her toaster broke I ordered it and she says it is the best toaster she ever had. It browns evenly on both sides and does an excellent job of toasting bagels also. She has had toasters that cost alot more over the years and this is the one that rates the highest for all her toasting needs. Mary
