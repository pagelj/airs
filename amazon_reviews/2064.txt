Great quality for the price
I was a little skeptical of the low price of this camera as I have had many poor quality cmos cameras before (I actually ordered a 80 dollar one just in case). First off the build quality is excellent, strong materials and decent quality wire. I then took it to my TV and hooked it up to see the image quality. I was more than shocked to see a very clear picture with good color. Low light images are not that great but I think the reverse lights on the car will illuminate the surrounding areas sufficiently to get a decent picture. Instructions are poor (not that you need them if you are familiar with vehicle wiring), might as well just throw them out, that is how useless they are. All in all I'm happy I took the chance on this cheap camera.
