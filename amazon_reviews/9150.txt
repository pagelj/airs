I discovered this coffee maker when I bought a vacation home and it was included with the purchase.  I was so impressed that I bought for our main residence also. Over the years I have bought and given away at least 12 coffee machines.  This cuisinart coffee maker makes the best of my coffee beans, which I have always ground fresh with every machine I've owned.  Perhaps it's the little coffee filter the water is processed through (don't know for sure), but it just tastes better. REVIEW DATE: 2-25-2013Additional comments after 2 years of use:  This was my second Cuisinart machine purchased.  I have one that we use at second home that has worked perfectly for 7 years.  This one is barely 2 years - 2 months, and it is DEAD!  I am so disappointed.  After reading the long list of reviews, I'm starting to wonder if Cuisinart has gone downhill and is no longer a quality machine.  It appears the older models are much more reliable.  I will throw this one in the garbage and will not consider buying Cuisinart products.
