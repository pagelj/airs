We bought this coffee maker in December of 2011 and I love this product. We have in the past used the Hamilton Beach coffee maker similar to this one and liked it very much. After going through three of those, I wanted a change. This Cuisinart is wonderful. I love the Community Coffee brand we get in Louisiana and this coffee maker makes great coffee and preserves the flavor for a long time... though the coffee doesn't really last long in my house. With this, you just put your cup under and fill. This is a great appliance that makes very tasty coffee. Also you can fill taller mugs and insulated travel mugs. You will be happy with this one.
