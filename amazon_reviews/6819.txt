Coming from someone who hasn't had a smart phone before, this phone is perfect.
I dont have large hands or small hands, about medium sized. I was able to use this phone with one hand no problem which was a big plus for me, one of the only reasons why i didn't buy a full sized S3. I have tried many good graphics games and they all run fine but i do lag a little sometimes in contract killer 2. Aside from that, the only real downside that i can think of is that the screen is a little less responsive than my friends i phone 5's and galaxy S3's. (I would never buy an i phone anyways)
