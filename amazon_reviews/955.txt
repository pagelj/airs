Sigma lens for Nikon DLSR
I bought this Sigma lens after much consideration.  I have used a friend's Nikon lens and it took beautiful pictures.  However, being that I am a recreational picture taker and I shoot mainly my boys sports teams, I opted for a more economical lens.  I must say that for my needs and for the money difference, so far, this lens has not disapointed me yet.  I have shot amazing football pictures and I am very happy with it's performance.
