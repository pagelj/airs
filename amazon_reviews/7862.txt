I have been in the process of trying to find a coffee maker and not having much luck. Usually within 6 months they end up in the trash. I thought with this one I had finally found one that would last me a while. Right.... wrong! When it first arrived I took it out of the box ran a cycle to clean it before actually making coffee in it which I do with all my coffee makers when they arrive. This one seemed to have a nice quiet motor compared to others I had. Then came the real test, the first cup of coffee. Ahhhh just like Folgers good to the last drop. I was very happy that I finally found a good coffee maker. The first few months went fine. No problems at all and I was enjoying the coffee it was making then all the sudden I started to notice small puddles of coffee on the counter. Aww well maybe some leaked after filling the cup. No big deal just clean it up. However the puddles started to get bigger and bigger and the cups of coffee were not getting filled up. Hmmm I thought maybe it needs a good cleaning so I cleaned it up. Nope, still leaks. I thought maybe I'm putting too much water in... nope that's not it either. It just plain leaks! Very disappointing since it does make good coffee what manages to actually make it's way to the cup... Too bad because it's a nice looking coffee maker. It's compact design looks great on the counter. It's easy to clean and easy to make coffee in. The downside is it leaks!! Back to the drawing board for me.
