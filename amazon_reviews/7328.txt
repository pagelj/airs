Toaster Perfection
All I wanted was a toaster that would do it's job well.  I had been through toasters and toaster ovens that would only toast one side of the bread, needed more than one cycle, burn bagels, etc. etc.  After some research, I decided to try out this Kitchenaid model and I'm glad I did. I'm a frequent bagel eater and I find the bagel function to be very handy.  It perfectly toasts the cut side of the bagel while warming the other side, which leaves the bagel still perfectly chewy. The toasting levels are very easy to adjust, just turn the knob, and you have perfect, evenly browned toast. Cleanup is a breeze.  Plus, it comes in a variety of colors to suit pretty much everyone out there. No frills, nothing fancy schmancy.... it's just a toaster that does it's job well.
