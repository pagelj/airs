This carmera is just what we wanted.
This camera takes pictures much faster than my previous camera.  It does better in speed shooting situations.  It may not have the focus accuracy of my old camera, but it makes up for that in the fact that I usually missed more moments because of a slow shooting response than I do now in an out of focus shot. Overall 4 out of 5. PS: I bought mine used from someone with good ratings and paid almost one-third less.  It still works great.
