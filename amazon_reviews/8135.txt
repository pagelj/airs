i've only used the wet vacuum part of this product.  cleans well, easy to use, easy maintenance, cap for solution refill attached so cap doesn't get lost, comfortable grip.  the only drawback is, in and around my city, i can't find the solution sold at stores so i have to order it from amazon.  the plus side is amazon probably has the cheaper price.
