Very happy with the quality
I had the opportunity to spend a few months in my bedroom this Winter with some torn ligaments.  So I wanted to feel comfortable and bought some accessories for my iPad, this being one of them.  I would say, without hesitation, it's the nicest cable I own!  I've purchased many cables over the years (former Apple Computer engineer) and even the Apple cables don't compare (except the old SCSI).  I'll be buying more Mediabridge products in the future.
