Great!
Love this buy - I got 2 HDMI cables for so much less than a single cable at a big box store. There is literally no reason to pay more for a HDMI cable, they are all identical and function the same (If they did not, they would not be allowed to market themselves as HDMI!)I also really like that the ends are color codes. I have a third cable which is not colored, and this makes it super easy to tell them all apart! The connectors are high quality - they snap in place very nice and stay better than other more expensive cables. All in all, no reason not to buy!
