Great investment!
I have a Garmin Nuvi 2595 and this screen protector does its job perfectly! I am not sure why other reviewers have a difficult time with the screen. I have been using it for 3 months now and have not encountered any problems. Just make sure you clean the screen well (I don't suggest using the "microfiber" cloth that came with it; use your eyeglasses lens cloth instead) and remove any bubbles using a credit card after applying the protector. This is a cheap investment for a very expensive navigator. It's worth it.
