TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.... IS TRUE!
We were extremely skeptical that the HDMI cables priced soooo low ($1.75?!!) would be any good, but figured we'd give them a try.  Boy were we pleasantly surprised.  These function as well as the high priced ($30 and up, up, up)HDMI cables that have previously purchased elsewhere. There was absolutely no difference that our eyes could detect.  This was a case of too good to be true was really true. Swallow your skepticism, and try these. You won't be disappointed!
