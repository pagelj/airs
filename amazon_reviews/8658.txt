Worst product purchased from Amazon!
After reading the reviews, I purchased this product about a year ago.  I found that the drip arrangement did not work well unless I put something underneath the unit so that the grease would flow backward toward the grease catcher at the back.  After doing that for awhile one of the "feet" on the back of the unit just broke off.  My husband tried to glue it on, but it came off again.  This is such a disappointment!  The engineering on this unit is poor and the quality is poor also.
