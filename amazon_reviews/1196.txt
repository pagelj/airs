"checking network connection please wait"
This product has a slick interface and lots of nice features.  Unfortunately, trying to stream movies via Netflix, Vudu, etc very often results in a message stating "checking network connection please wait", and then right back to the menu screen with no explanation whatsoever.  Over and over again until you just quit trying and do something else.  I have "checked" the network connection, and WiFi is connection, signal at 90%+.  No problems with the network.  I have a 50mbs internet connection.  No other devices ever have any problem with my network or bandwidth.  Again, there is no explanation onscreen for failing to connect, and no actual error message giving any indication of what is wrong.  Also, the built in browser works fine over the network.  This is apparently a terrible software bug that basically makes the device worthless unless you want to watch discs. Also, this just started a couple of weeks after the retailer's return period was up.  I would probably smash it in my driveway and buy a different device -- but unfortunately this was a birthday present from my wife.  In any event, I will stay away from Sony products in the future.
