Worst Toaster I've Owned
I bought this because of all the stellar reviews. I am writing now in the hopes that it will prevent someone else from making the same mistake in purchasing this. It's the worst design I've ever seen on a toaster, seemingly made for the express purpose of burning people's fingers. There is a metal strip that runs behind the handle. It heats up during cooking and I (and everyone else in my family) burn my fingers on it about 60% of the time that I open the oven. The rack on which the food cooks has a lip on it that seems designed to make it difficult to get the food out of the oven. I've actually ignited three pot holders in the process of removing food from the oven. The controls are far more complicated than they should be and no visitors to my home are able to figure out how to make toast. The control panel has 16 buttons. The simple act of toasting bread requires one to press the "toast" button, then hit arrows until the desired level of toasting is achieved, press additional buttons if bagels or multiple toast slices are involved and finally press the on/off button. The toast it produces is adequate (toasted on top, mostly untoasted on the bottom), but no better than what the most inexpensive Walmart toaster can do. The claim about the oven's ability to cook an entire 12" pizza is a bald-faced lie as the entire interior of the toaster from wall to wall is only 12 inches and the pizza would have to be jammed into the oven and in contact with all sides of it. My nine-year-old can't even make toast for herself because of the combination of confusing buttons and the likelihood of being burned.
