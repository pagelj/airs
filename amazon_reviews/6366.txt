Third time's a charm.
I wanted to purchase a screen protector for my new Galaxy SIII. The fit is great. However, I ended up going through 2 of the 3 enclosed protectors, before getting the third one to cooperate and apply correctly. The protector sticks to the phone's screen just fine. However, when you peel off the exterior layer, the layer that is attached to the phone's screen, kept coming up with it? It was a little frustrating, but I haven't had any issues with the third protector, since it's been on the phone. It seems to be staying put? I think I'll try another brand, the next time around?
