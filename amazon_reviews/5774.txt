awesome!
everything about this is well thought out and designed and it comes through. you can adjust it as much as you wantit sticks and doesnt come off!!! (main thing i hate about suction cup products)it sticks to more than the windshield, i stuck mine on the dash just to see if it would stay and its been there since i bought it! i have no cons, but maybe one concern. it feels and sounds plastic and cheap when you lock and unlock. it works and no problems so far, so hopefully it stays that way. buy it!
