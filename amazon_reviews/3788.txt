Pressure Crack
I bought this camera for my point-and-shoot carry-everywhere-with-me camera.  I have other more expensive cameras, but wanted something lightweight and good quality for everything else.  I kept the camera in my purse, which I do not abuse, and within one month had a pressure crack. I took it to the camera store and was told that these cameras cannot take any abuse because pressure cracks occur, which are not covered under warranty.  To fix is almost the cost of a new one, so that's what I'm going to do.  I'm headed back to Canon.  I should have never left.
