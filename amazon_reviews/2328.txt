Ram Universal X Grip w/ 1 inch ball
I use my X Grip in my truck and my 02 Honda Goldwing. It holds my Thunderbolt cell phone while mounted on the handlebars. So far with several hundreds of miles logged with bumps and vibration for the bike, I have not had an issue with worrying about my phone coming out. The only minor thing I noticed is after putting my phone in the X Grip, it does have a tendency to rotate and this will vary depending on the size of your device. With mine it is very little but the cell is not held straight up and down, it will turn just alittle to one side. As I said this is a minor thing. Otherwise it does just what I wanted it to do.  I would advise anyone to buy this product.
