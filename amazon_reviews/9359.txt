Worth every penny
I am very happy with my acquisition of the OPPO BDP-103.  The best decision I made in terms of buying a BDP and the extra bucks were worth every penny.  The sound quality is many times superior to other blu-ray players under $500. While picture quality from blu ray players is about the same in most of the cases, not when it comes to the OPPO BDP-103.  Even in this area, the OPPO BDP-103 is better than the rest for BDP under $500.  With the OPPO BDP-103, it starts with top build quality, a quality that you just won't get from other blu ray players selling under $500. Just one problem to report, my BDP stop working last night.  I decided to send it back to Amazon, but I am replacing it with another OPPO BDP-103 from Amazon. I hope I have better luck, as I do love the quality of this BDP.
