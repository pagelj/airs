Outstanding travel companion
I purchased this as a carry-on to travel with my computer and also to us as my purse. To save money I often have to make a couple of stops as well as change airlines so have to have a carry-on that is easy to use and holds a lots.  It worked great. So well made, tons of room, so easy to use, wheels are well designed so easy handle.  Highly recommend this item. I would personal buy their other product.  I searched for a long time for this perfect carry on bag.
