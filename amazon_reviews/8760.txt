Great Speedlight Flash
First speed light flash. Still experimenting but very pleased with my purchase. Works great with my Nikon D5100. Didn't realize how much weight it adds especially with 105 mm macro but I assume that any other like type flash would be similar in weight. Overall happy with item.
