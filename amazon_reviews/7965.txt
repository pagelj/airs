Great Flash for Nikon D40
The flash on my Nikon D40 stopped working for some reason, which seems to be a common problem for owners of this particular model.  Between buying an external flash for the D40 or buying a new SLR altogether, I opted for the former.  The flash works simply and easily, and is much brighter than the camera's built-in flash ever was.  The pictures turn out better as well.  Thankfully it works really well, since having this flash prevented me from having to buy another SLR.  Considering a new camera with new lenses and other miscellaneous equipment could have run into the thousands, the cost of this flash (just over $100 in total) was well worth it for me. I'd recommend this flash to anyone whose D40 is having flash problems.
