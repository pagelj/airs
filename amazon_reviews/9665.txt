The year is 2070, the alien race we call "Buggers" has already  attacked Earth twice, and because of their superior technology we feel a third attack would wipe us out for good.  This is the backdrop setting for Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game.  In the book, the Buggers already launched two invasions to Earth and they were both repelled.  Not because of militarilistic might, but because of great and brilliant leaders.  That was 50 years ago.  All of Earth's leaders from the first and second invasion are dead now, and there is no one to lead Earth's forces against the Buggers.  To solve this problem, a school called Battle School is started and its sole purpose is to train leaders for Earth.  Ender is one of the students at Battle School and he is by far the best.  But can he live up to the daunting challange of saving Earth from the Buggers?  You'll have to read to find out!
