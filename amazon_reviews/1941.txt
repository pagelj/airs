PERFECT!!!, but only if you don't use CDs
This is by far the best cellphone mount I've used; no suction cups, vent mounts or sticky substances.  Fits perfectly into the CD slot and secures very easily.  Only buy if you don't use CDs in your vehicle because you'll have to remove each time you eject of load player.  Phone sits very securely and the swivel works extremely well. I highly recommend.
