If you're a serious photographer, better buy a B+W or Hoya.
I wanted to give a try to this cheap lens uv filter with my new canon EF 50mm 1.4 USM. The result was just dissappointment. I got lots of unwanted extra reflections on my pictures, from light sources that were not even in the picture. Reflections are immediately noticeable on low light condition pictures. It seems a well built filter, fits nice on the lens, and it do protect it, but if you're serious about photography and details on it, should better get a B+W B+W 58mm Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Coating (010M) or Hoya filter Hoya 58mm UV (Ultra Violet) Multi Coated Glass Filter. They are more expensive, but you won't get any unwanted results in your pictures.
