I just bought this and used it twice already.  I have ceramic tile floors and nothing else seemed to clean them adequately.  This does a wet spin scrub and then vacuums up the dirty water off the floor.  My floors haven't looked this clean in quite awhile!  It's not complicated to use and it does have removable parts -- the cleaning solution and the dirty water cannisters.  Both are easy to remove and clean.  The FloorMate is a bit heavy and I can't hang it for storage, so I keep it stored standing in my laundry room.  It takes some effort to use, but as long as you don't have back or shoulder problems it should work fine for you.  It really is the best floor cleaner I've had yet, and especially for tile floors with grout in between.  It really removes the dirt buildup.  I use the accompanying Hoover Tile and Grout Cleaner concentrate but I make the solution less concentrated than the instructions say & it worked fine.
