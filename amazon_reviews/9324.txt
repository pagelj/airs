Winter better hurry up....
Okay, I've read enough of this series to expect characters that I like to die, but GRRM is killing his fans by drawing out this saga. I know that the timeline is concurrent with the previous volume, so I expected some re-hashing of the storyline in this book. I suspect that the "Ooh, let's surprise the reader by killing a main character" gimmick has become Martin's trademark. But I think he's now expected to do it at least once per book. It's a shame, because I think now fans are betting on who lives or dies, a d have forgotten what the series is all about. Any series where 90+ pages of the book are devoted to telling you who the heck all the characters are is just a page or two away from collapsing under it's own weight. I'm not even sure if I care who ends up on the Iron Throne, because "Winter is Coming", and it'll probably kill everyone.
