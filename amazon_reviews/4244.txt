roku is the best player --- so good that i canceled my cable!!
i was trying to avoid the riasing cost every year of my cable provider. for 2years i have been looking at a different way of getting what i want. i finally made up my mind when the cable went up another 10 bucks... this is the best move i have ever made.. i get to watch tv with out the commercials finally. and no cost increase come january!! roku works better than i thought it would.. i have not a complaint in the world..
