Black Seed Bead Sequined Leaf Evening Handbag/Clasp Purse Clutch
After reading the previous reviews< I thought I would purchase it for a black tie gala. I like it because it is different than a vintage beaded evening handbag that I have had for many years. It is a great purse for the price point. Be sure to tighten the round metal parts that hold the metal handle together BEFORE you wear it. My guy did just that for me with wire pliers and it held together for the event. The bag is also deeper and wider than the one that I had so I was able to place my phone, compact, comb, lip color, mints, and facial tissues it it!
