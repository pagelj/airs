I am wheelchair bound and can't manage a large vacuum. The Linx is lightweight, maneuverable, and powerful. It vacuums both hard floors and carpets. I have a several dogs and the Linx vacuums their hair and the pieces of stuff they drag in from the yard. Crumbs, hair, torn paper--it sucks it all up. I highly advise buying an extra battery so you can just swap the spent one out for a fresh one. I have a battery charging constantly. My house is always nicely vacuumed thanks to the Linx. I highly recommend it
