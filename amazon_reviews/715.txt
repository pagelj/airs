I love this little canister vacuum cleaner. I was looking for a light weight yet powerful cleaner for floors, furniture and blinds. This fits the bill and works very well. I also have attachments from my Sears Kenmore canister which will work with this sweeper. I've done a lot of cleaning since receiving it and am a happy camper. Would recommend this sweeper to anyone. I also prefer using a sweeper with bags which this sweeper uses.
