Slow and unreliable phone
I had my Motorola RAZR for 9 months, and I'm glad to be rid of it.  There was slight delay between when I pressed a button and when the screen would pop up which was irritating and made simple tasks confusing.  Several times it froze up for a minute after I ended a call.  I talk on the phone probably 30 minutes everyday and rarely text, but still the battery life was poor.  I had to charge it everyday.  I also found the keypad awkward and difficult to use. On the positive side, however, it sleek and has a very bright, attractive screen. I don't recommend the RAZR to anyone looking for a reliable phone.
