Perfect bag for biking to class!
This is a great bag for biking to class with the things I need.  It just barely fits my macbook air 13 inch (plenty of room depth wise, but cuts it close at the top), plus two or three smaller notebooks in the main compartment.  There are also compartments for everything else I would need in class (i. e. pencils/pens/calculator/etc.).  The comfort of this bag is far beyond what I had been expecting.  I have several lower back problems and this bag is easier on my back than anything else I've tried so far.  Not to mention, I feel no worry of the bag sliding off when riding my bike.  I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a backpack to bike with or a just a sling bag in general!
