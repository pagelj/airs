What a piece of junk!
I read the other reviews, heard about the dreaded "white screen" and figured it couldn't happen to me. It did.  Now I will be without this POS until Motorola can fix what apparently is a design flaw.  There is a problem with the flip design as, like others, my phone shuts off when I close it, or it will shut off during a call, or it will cycle off at any time-with no warning. Of course it is 6 days past the return point for Amazon. I really used to like this phone-but I need reliable.
