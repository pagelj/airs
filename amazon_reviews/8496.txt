Nice Protection, Nice Price
My wife ordered these for her iPhone 5. She asked me to help put it on, but of course I was like "No way! If I mess up on this, you will kill me!". As you can see, I'm still alive... so that means we put it on successfully! There are 3 protectors in the package. This means you have 3 chances to get it right. I recommend following the directions 100%. Also, I recommend applying them in the cleanest room in your house or at a friend's house that has a clean room. The longer you take to apply the film, the more likely it will be that debris attach to the back of it, so the faster you do it, the better. Of course, that also increases your chance of misaligning it too. The package comes with everything you need. A cloth to wipe with, the protectors themselves, instructions, and a card to help get rid of bubbles. There's even a video on their website that shows someone applying one of these to their device. For my wife's phone, we bought a Otterbox Defender case. This comes with its own screen protector. Guess what though? Otterbox screen protectors are awful! Debris do get through and so does moisture -- which creates the annoying RAINBOW effect. The best solution? Remove their screen protector and instead apply one of these bad boys! Alternatively, you could just use two screen protectors. Either way, you'll want one of these. So would I buy this product again? Yes, I most certainly would!
