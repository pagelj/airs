like it a lot
love this camera.  i am giving it 4 stars though because the time it takes to take a photo is annoying.  It is especially frustrating if you are taking pictures of babies or nature.  the blue color is beautiful.  the zoom feature is great.  make sure you take the lens cap off before turning on the camera.  I definitely see this as the future downfall of this camera for myself.  i have always turned on my cameras before removing the lens to get ready.  You will get an error message and instruction to turn off your camera and then remove lens cap if you accidentally do this.  the black and white scene setting takes great photos.
