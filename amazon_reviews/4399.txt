Powerful!
Redeeming Love is the best book that I have ever read. I have now read it 3 times.  The words on the pages are God ordained. I wept upon my knees and thanked God for His amazing grace, mercy, and unfailing love.  I recommend this book to everyone I meet.  Please, please read this novel, and pass it on to as many people as possible.  It will change your life!  God's continued blessings to Francine Rivers and her awesome ministry!
