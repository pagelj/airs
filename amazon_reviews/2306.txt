This is a great Coffeemaker ,I have used MR Coffee for years and find the easy to clean and to set up for your morning coffee . One thing that I am not happy with is that all the Mr Coffee makers I have used ,I find that the spouts have a habit of dripping a little when pouring. Not a problem ,but annoying . Otherwise the makers are reliable ,long lasting and through Amazon the prices are always reasonable . You can get different colors too !!!
