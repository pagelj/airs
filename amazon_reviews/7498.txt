A terrible camera
Firstly, the photo quality of this camera is terrible - expect most of your shots to be completely out of focus. It also has terrible light sensitivity and color balance. This is assuming that your camera works to begin with. You can also expect that transfering pictures from the camera to your computer will fail more often than not - after a few months, the camera could no longer be detected by computers, rendering it useless. I would advise that you spend a little extra money for a camera that works - otherwise, you'll find yourself spending as much, if not more, to constantly replace this piece of garbage
