I bought this about a month back. Its small, portable and easy to clean. I makes great coffee and steams milk as well. I think its serves the purpose of making a quick espresso or a latte or hot chocolate. Cons -- Water level indicator would have helped- Cant steam mil and brew coffee simultaneously- If you are just trying to steam milk it might take forever for the water to boil.
