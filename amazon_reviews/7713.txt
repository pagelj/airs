Heavy duty gamer loves this computer
This computer is blazing fast, has an awesome screen, and the speakers need no assistance.  I am on my computer every day for a good share of the day - gaming when I want to relax and writing when I'm working.  It's a little heavy, so taking it to school for my every day school work isn't happening.  But using it at home works fabulously.
