Good buy
Positives: holds battery charge a long while. Works as expected underwater, easy to master. Takes very decent (but not exceptional) pictures. Negatives: Underwater, it takes about 5-7 seconds between shots. Does matter if the fish are moving quickly. Blues are a bit brighter in picture than in real life. Zoom is limited.
