Great product for the price
Pros:- Compact size.- USB port as well as standard outlet.- Doesn't get too hot.- Battery clips included. Cons:- Charges relatively slowly.- Power button switches to off when the car is no longer powered. (This may be a safety feature but it's a pain when you stop for gas and forget to turn it back on to continue charging your devices. All in all, I'm happy with this purchase.  The ability to charge multiple devices while on road trips as well as it's compact design make it well worth the price.  I would recommend it to friends although I wish it would charge a bit faster.
