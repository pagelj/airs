A healing book.
I feel like "Redeeming Love" was dropped into my lap as a love-gift from God Himself (shipped via amazon. com)  :-)  For anyone who has ever been hurt, for anyone who has ever been rejected, for anyone who  has heard that God loves you unconditionally but struggled to believe that  because of feelings of unworthiness, for anyone who has ever struggled with  pride or striving to please God through "works" or  "earn" love, for anyone who has ever thought that God would give  up on you because you had given up on Him---this book is for you!  Francine  Rivers retold the story of Hosea in such a powerful way that all I can  continue to do is weep with joy... God loves me!  GOD loves me!  God LOVES  me!  God loves ME!  This book is not only well-crafted & intriguing,  it is like a healing balm of God's Word & His Love to every wounded  heart.  READ THIS BOOK:  you will not close the last page unchanged, I can  assure you!
