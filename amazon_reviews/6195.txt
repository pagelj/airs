Works
There isn't much to say about these mounts, as it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Very easy to install as it holds my 42" LCD perfectly level.  It does allow you to move the rotate the tv and move it for a better viewing angle.  Realistically though for the price you can't beat it! I only needed minimal tools to install, but you can't use the level included in the package because its way too small.
