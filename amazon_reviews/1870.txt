Great product!!
I had a bad experience purchasing a cheaper screen protector, and I am glad I went to this product after that experience.  The three screen protectors are very high quality and I had no problem getting the protector on in my first try with the first protector with no bubbles (as opposed to trying six times with the cheaper protectors).  The package is great and professional, and comes with a polishing cloth, a card for pressing out air bubbles, and something I have never seen with a screen protector, dust removing tape.  This tape is great because it can get literally every tiny piece of dust off the surface of the phone before applying the screen protector.  The only word of caution I leave is be careful if you have a phone case when applying because mine was a little off center and when I put my case back on, it made a bubble on the side of the phone.  Oh yea, and the protectors have a lifetime warranty, pretty cool if you ask me!
