It DOES play multi regions... if you know the trick!
I recently this just to play region 2 DVD's. No, it doesn't work right out of the box, but it does work nicely! Try this:Start with player ON, but no disc inserted. Press "Set up"button and release,Press Vol +, Vol-, Vol +, Vol -,A number 1 will show up in upper right hand corner of the screenChange to 255 (All region) by pressing the right arrow. Keep pressing- #255 will pop up after a few tries. Press "Set up" again. Insert your DVDYou may need to press the NTSC/Pal button on the remote once or twice to get the screen to stop 'rolling'This did the trick for me, and I am now happily watching Kingdom Series 1- a region 2 DVD :-)Oh, yes it's a cheap little DVD player, so take care with it. For the low price and my purpose-it's perfect.
