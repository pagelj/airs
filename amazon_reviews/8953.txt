Let me start out by saying that this unit is fantastic. It does just about everything you would want to do with a microwave. I give it 4 stars only because of the issue I will write about below. I recently purchased this microwave and quickly noticed that I was going to have the same issues that many other people were having regarding the door not opening when the button was pressed. Having over 25 years experience working with mechanical devices, I figured that instead of returning the unit or sending it out for repair, I'd try to figure out what is actually going on and why so many people are having this issue. What I found out is that Panasonic made their tolerances too tight. The door opening mechanism bottoms out at the exact point where the door latch releases, so any minor variance in construction or chassis warpage will cause the door not to release when the button is pressed. What I did find out is that the door latch works perfectly when the cover is removed. They didn't use the same strict tolerances when they drilled the holes for the stainless steel cover to the chassis, so when the cover is attached, it ever-so-slightly warps the chassis in such a way that the door latch mechinism won't release the door. THE FIX:The fix is actually very easy and you don't have to open the unit or void the warranty, just loosen the two stainless steel screws that hold the cover on the bottom right side of the unit. (I only hade to loosen the screws about a 1/4 turn) That's it! This is enough to correct the problem. I hope that anyone that has purchased this unit and has run into this problem will give this a try before returning it or sending it out for repair. It's a 30 second fix.
