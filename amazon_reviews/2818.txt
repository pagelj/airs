Unreliable
We have had this toaster since September 2011.  We have tried everything that we know to make it work properly for us without success.  It is nice to look at with the fancy buttons all of which work.  The problem is the toasting is so irratic that if we are not standing there looking at it, then we end up with toast, bagel, or whatever burnt.  If we set it to toast light then we have to keep pushing the "little bit more" button.  It is now cheaper than it was when we purchased it but I would say that it is actually worse than the $35 toaster we replaced it with.  I sure do wish we had never bought it as we are very unhappy.  Breville should be able to do better than this for $120.
