My parents had a similar set of Chicago Cutlery Walnut blades from the early 90s and these simply do not compare. This knife set is pathetic. The block and handles of the blade arrived without being oiled. They were dry pieces of wood that literally caused splinters when handled. I tried soaking them in oil for a couple of days, but that did not work long term. After a few washes (by hand) the knives' handles had already gone back to splintery wood. On top of that, the blades began rusting. I am very disappointed by the lack of quality seen in this knife set. I would not recommend it to anyone.
