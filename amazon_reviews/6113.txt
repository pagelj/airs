Great Product
I bought both this and the Sony ICDPX312 to compare them. I like the feel of the Olympus much better. The buttons are more intuitive. The location for all the modifications are easier to find and activate. I wish I had bought two Olympus recorders instead of one of each of the top of the line products. I am very happy with this product and if this one ever dies, I will order another one. Great job Olympus!!! To be fair, the Sony recorder does have more features than the Olympus. One useful one in particular is the 't-mark' which allows one to segment a large recording for easy division. So Sony is more diverse, Olympus is more user friendly. But both work really well.
