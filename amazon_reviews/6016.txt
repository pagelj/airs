works perfectly in my samsung galaxy S2
Was just looking for a great card to put all of my music on with my Galaxy S2.  I had run out of memory, and this did the trick.  it was easy to trasnfer the files from my phone to the computer and then to my microSD card to put into my phone.  Easy transfer, wish I would have done it sooner.
