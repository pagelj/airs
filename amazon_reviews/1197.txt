Adapter works fine but shipper makes you pay more
The product was great except for the fact that I had to pay $3.00 extra just to pick it up at the Post Office just because the shipper didn't ship it using the right packaging. I personally use the adapter for plugging in my iPod into Xbox 360 mic chat just so I can mess with my friends but other than that I don't use for much else
