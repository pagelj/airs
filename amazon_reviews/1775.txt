Good buy!!
I was thrilled when i received mine a few days ago and when i showed it to my sister and sister-in-law, they thought it was the real thing! I own a couple of the original dooney & bourke but i don't want to spend that much for this kind and so i don't mind the one that i have right now. My sister bought one last night and my sister-in-law will buy one too. The bag really looks nice and there's a lot of room for all your stuff.
