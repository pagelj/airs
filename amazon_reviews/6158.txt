Did I mention that I absolutely love this canister vacuum... I can't begin to tell you how many vacs I bought only to be disappointed. We have all hardwood and tile floors. This canister vac works great. It rolls around the floors easily, has great suction and is very quiet compared to most. I was skeptical after buying other vacuums so when I got this one, I really wasn't expecting a lot. Boy was I surprised. I couldn't stop vacuuming! I just love everything about this machine. And the price was well worth the product. I did a lot of research and this product is rated in the top ten. Never been so happy with a vacuum. It stores easily and is easy to clean the dirt cup. We have three dogs that shed and four cats, you'd never know it by the looks of my floors. I absolutely positively love this machine. Thank you Amazon.
