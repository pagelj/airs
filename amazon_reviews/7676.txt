Good, but a few things you need to know up front
Rather than some long winded review, how about the pros and cons:PROS:InexpensiveDecent quality pictureWireless setup for your LAN is a breezeWell builtEasy to controlCONS:Remote viewing setup is a chore - read up on port forwarding before you installIf you have a dynamic IP (almost all ISP's assign IP addresses dynamically), you will lose your remote viewing if your ISP resets your IP or you lose you modem like during a power outage.  To prevent this, you have to go through a somewhat complicated process of singing up with a (free) DNS service like no-ip. biz.  then you have to configure the camera to work with that service.  I'm neither and expert nor an idiot and it took me a full day to get everything right. The IR function is fair at best - you won't get any worthwhile detail in near darkness. The camera runs all the time but only captures video during an alarm but you need an FTP server to upload the actual video so while you can watch it real time on your portable device you won't be capturing the full video, only snapshots. The alarm function requires going into the software to deactivate unless you want hundreds of photos being emailed constantly of your dog wandering around the house.  There really should be a desktop icon for the alarm function to quickly turn on/off. Cord on the AC adapter is way too short to mount the camera up high on the wall where it is less noticeable to potential thieves. Conclusion:  It's an excellent deal for <$100 considering not too many years ago a camera of this capability and quality would have cost many multiples of its current price.  Just recognize its limitations and you'll be pleased.
