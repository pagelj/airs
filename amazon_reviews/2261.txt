a decent buy for the money
I bought this to keep my laptop from overheating while playing video games, this it does well enough.  The construction of the pad itself is relatively shoddy, it's hard plastic so it'll survive a fall but it could be easily broken.  Also, the pads that hold the laptop in place are poorly glued on.  That being said, the product works wonderfully for five dollars.  The blue LED's are pretty cool looking, and the fans are quiet enough.  Two caveats, the first being that I wouldn't recommend using this on a table with a tablecloth; if the tablecloth rides up at all you have to adjust it so it stops colliding with the fans and making an awful noise.  Second, this item does not work for use in one's lap, for the same reason it doesn't work on a table with a tablecloth. All of that being said, the product is still wonderful.  For the price it does a stupendous job, it looks cool and as long as you're not too rough with it it should serve your purposes wonderfully.
