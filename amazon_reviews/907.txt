Decent diaper bag for the price
Like others have said, its not a true conversion into a backpack, and the wipes case doesn't stay closed. I ended up replacing it with a similar case. The material of the backpack is better quality than I expected and easy to clean. The zippers are good quality and easy to open and close. There's also lots of pockets and compartments in this bag which makes organizing easy. Its a decent sized bag and I can fit a lot in here if I wanted to. I just keep the basics in here for now. For the men out there: My husband is big guy (6'2" and pretty built), and had a hard time using it as a backpack.(we extended the straps to their full length) and he looked pretty silly. haha Gotta give him points for trying though. He just uses it as a normal diaper bag. 8)For what it's worth, its a pretty good bag. I would have given it 5 stars if it were more guy friendly and really did what it claims.
