Terrible ringing sound
I've had this DVD player for over a year now and for about 2 months now, it has this horrific ringing sound that goes off and on while i'm watching a movie. Its very very irritating. When I turn the machine off, its gotten so bad that the ringing won't stop, I have to unplug the DVD player in order for that ringing to go away. I'm in the process of looking for a new DVD player and once I do, this one will be thrown in the garbage!
