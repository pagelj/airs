Good *** UPDATED ***
We needed something immediate for our home office. This product came fast, perfectly wrapped in bubble wrap and i set it up in 15 minute ( internet connection included ). Overall good product, a bit slow, but i am sure we can add memory space.*********UPDATE******DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!! WE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT IN JANUARY, BY APRIL/MAY IT WAS WORTHLESS. WE HAD NOTHING ON OUR DESKTOP, ( NO PICTURES, NO FILES, NO ITUNES, NOTHING !!!!! AND IT TOOK US HALF AN HOUR TO LOG IN. AFTER CONTACTING THE STAFF, THE FIRST FEW EMAILS WERE RESPONDED FAST. BUT THE TECHNICIAN TOLD US WE SHOULD SEND THE DESKTOP BACK SO THEY COULD FIX IT. WE REFUSED TO DO IT, SHIPPING FEES+TECHNICIAN FEES = WE WHERE BETTER OFF BUYING A NEW DEVICE. THE WAY YOU HANDLE A CLAIM IS WHAT MAKES YOUR BUSINESS STAND OUT. MY PURCHASE MAY BE DEFECTIOUS , BUT ITS THE WAY MY CLAIM IS BEING RESPONDED TO THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT TOOK 2 EMAILS FOR THESE GUYS TO GET BACK TO ME. AND AFTER THE TECH ASKED ME TO DOWNLOAD A SOFTWARE SO HE CAN BREAK INTO MY COMPUTER TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS ( IT TOOK ME A WHOLE DAY TO DOWNLOAD THAT SOFTWARE ) I WAS TOLD HE COULDN'T LOG IN AND I HAD TO SEND THE THE DESKTOP BACK . HERE'S THE GOTCHA , I SAW HIM AS LOGGED IN AND HE COULD HAVE FIX MY COMPUTER BUT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER SCAM TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF ME. THIS ISN'T AN APPLE MACBOOK !!! ITS A PC WE PAID $112 FOR ! I WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEAR PAY MORE MONEY FOR  DEVICE THAT BARELY COST ME ANYTHING. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR AND THAT DEFINITELY A LESSON LEARNED
