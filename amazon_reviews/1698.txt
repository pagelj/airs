I have about 100 of these. I am a professional Film Maker, Photographer and use these just about every day on every project I do. On top of that, they are in every remote I have laying around the house. I would, AND DO, recommend them to everyone who uses batteries. They go great with the PowerEx MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer!
