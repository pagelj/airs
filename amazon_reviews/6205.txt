Great Sound
I was sick of my previous cordless phone, the sound would cut out or have a bunch of static. I read a lot of reviews and decided to get the Panasonic phone system. Glad I did, it has the most clarity from anywhere in my house. Plus all the features that this phone offers are great also. I love that you can download your phonebook from your cell phone to it. Also, the speaker phone on the hand units is awesome.
