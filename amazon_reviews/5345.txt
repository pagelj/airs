Why pay more?
The cables provide top quality for low price.  Bought 2 and they work great. Hooked my P3 and Digital cable up to TV with these.  Watched Nascar and got awesome sound and no delay visuals as well as great video game play with them. Why pay retail when you can get these for so much less.
