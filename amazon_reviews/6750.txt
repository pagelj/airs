Compliments from the ladies..... and gentleman!
Yes, I was stopped in a restaurant by a gentleman who wanted to compliment my purse.  He said it reminded him of full metal jacket.  Multiple compliments from the ladies of course.  Very nice quality, much better than I would have expected. This I say is definitely is a 'do'.
