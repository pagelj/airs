Don't  Have Resorces for the Mission?  Do It Anyway!
On Basilisk Station, what title could promise less of threat and violence.  Oh ye of little faith.  Honor Harrington succeeds in acomplishing a tough mission with the wrong equipment and personal for the job in spite of official indifference, the interference of the wealthy and politically connected, and the active if covert operations of her government's enemies.  In a book that sets the pattern for most of the series, Honor has to walk through a political minefield while surviving tactical situations that offer little hope for survival.  Weber has created a technology of future interstellar war with its own set of constraints and has even imagined competing schools of military thought that influence weapons development and deployment.  Inside these constraints Honor must motivate her discouraged crew and, when all else fails, fight a difficult battle with a crusier disguised as a merchant vessal.  This is a book where paying attention to the details of combat operations rewards the reader.  It also is a book where the relationship between captain and crew provides much of the interest.  Read this book and then the series that goes with it. You will discover a world fully realized and a fascinating examination of the relationships between politics, economics, and waging war all while following the career of one brilliant office, Honor Harrington.  If you thought Flandry was something, wait till you meet Honor.  And if Pohl Anderson's Flandry is a bit before you time, well you might check him out too.
