Amazing Value
These headphones (I have 3 pair) are an amazing value. I have been using headphones for over 40 years, listening critically to tapes, records, cds, radio, mp3s, etc. These ear buds have provided some of the best listening I have ever experienced. They do not have the greatest bass response but low frequency "thumping" does not entertain me the way it used to :-). They sound crisp with nice tight bass. I use these with mobile devices, usually a Sony FM radio. I mow grass with these plugged in my ears and they provide very decent noise reduction, very nearly as well as the so called "noise cancelling" (and very expensive and uncomfortable) headphones. The three sizes of ear buds should provide comfort for many ear tube sizes. Enjoy your audio with these buds everyone - and pay very little for them. I got them for around four dollars.
