great toaster
We had this toaster for couple of weeks now and we can't be happier with it.  Regardless of what type of bread we put into it, we get about as perfect toast as can be every time.  Unlike our old toaster where if we tried toast a second set of bread after the first set was done, the second set would not toast as well or as evenly.  Other times, it would not allow us to set the toaster until it had cool down.  With this Cuisinart, we have yet to encounter any problem.  I like the blue LED timer that let me know at a glance how much longer before it's done.  It would be nice if the toaster is more energy efficient and not have the LED always on.  Other than that, I have no complaint of what so ever.
