I love it, but I had problems with it freezing... (solved)
Now that I've gotten it to work, I love it as much as I love all my iPhone.  The only thing was when I first got it, it would always freeze or stop working after about 10 minutes.  I drove myself INSANE trying to find a solution.  I was so upset about it! So the solution, if you're like me is that you have to go to your router in any internet broswer by typing in the ip address, log in, and add in the atv's ip address as always allowed.  I don't trully understand why this is, but the explanation is something about devices are constantly "reconnecting" to the router, and this is what disrupts the atv's performance and ruins everything until fixed.  They say modern routers don't do this, but mine is only a few months old, so I think it's a problem with atv that it doesn't work out of the box or at least make it easier to find this solution which it took me HOURS to find.  I hope if you have this problem you find this review sooner.
