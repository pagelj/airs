Best Little Thing For This Price
I recently bought one of these little surprises kodak has on my way to Nickelodeon Resort, Florida. I was astonished with the results. After being accustomed to handle my Canon Rebel, I was a little skeptical about this one. However, once I got in the pool, I was more than pleased with the results: bright pictures, excellent video. A+. Not precisely an indoors camera, It developes fairly. As compare to the price, this is a piece of art, definitely my beach, pool, and outdoor activities first choice camera.
