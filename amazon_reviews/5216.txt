A Marvelous Journey for the Mind!
This dvd, in the Blu-Ray format, of Jerome Bixby's story "The Man From Earth" is an intellectual journey in the land of "what if?"... No spoilers here, but it will rekindle the sense of wonder you had when you first discovered Asimov or Bradbury, or Levin, or Bixby... It represents the apex of Sci-Fi, the Journey for the Mind, and may well "Blow your Mind" along the way. --- Now then, the actual PQ of the Blu-Ray transfer is not very good, but it is watchable for the most part. There are sections of film which appear quite grainy, yet other sections are very clear... the sound is also OK. --- However, I included the last part just to be honest. Please don't let that scare you away from buying this BR DVD... the story more than makes up for the lack of BR PQ. If you allow it to, this movie will really work your imagination...
