Great device
This product is very nice. I thought it would be a little lighter for all the more it is. I like the speed and simplicity. I think they idea of calling the items apps, or whatever is kinda dumb. They are all just shortcuts. It just opens a new tab in the same window. There is nothing special about that. It's a bookmark. No more no less. But I do love Chrome, and the way this performs, so I do think it is an excellent product, just not as light and sexy of a device as I would expect from Samsung with a Google OS.
