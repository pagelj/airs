fun game but unreasonable expectations for buying gems
The games a lot of fun but working with gems can be very unreasonable and expensive.  There are certain ponies and shops you have to get to move forward in the game. Many of these cost a huge number of gems. Gems are very hard to get in the game but you can buy them with real money. They are very over priced.
