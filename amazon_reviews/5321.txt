Interesting twist the band took
I whole different take on MCR. This album is interesting and fun, and I'm glad that they broke away from the whole "Black Parade" phase. It seemed to upset them that they were being called "emo". And, of course they tell a story in this album something about their alter-egos protecting a child or something along those lines. So I say good for them.
