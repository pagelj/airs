These are our daily use knives, particularly the paring knife, and steak knives. We've owned them about four years. They are beautiful, clean up well, but occasionally do need to be polished when water or rust spots appear. We don't dishwasher the chefs or carving knife, but we do dishwasher all of the other knives. Stainless steel doesn't sharpen to as keen of an edge as some other high carbon steel knives, but then the high carbon knives discolor more readily. That is the trade-off. As a result, for heavy veg prep, we'll grab the Global chefs knife. For raw meat, we prefer the Shun. At the dinner table. for roast or turkey carving, the Henckles outperforms the included knife. The scissors come apart for easy dish-washing and sanitizing and cut chicken bone with some effort. They stay sharp though, we've assaulted many a double walled cardboard box with them and haven't deemed it necessary to sharpen them yet. The honing steel is about all it takes. In hind sight, while we've collected particular knives for particular work thus obviating the need for the two largest knives in the set, we'd still buy this just to have a matching counter top set.
