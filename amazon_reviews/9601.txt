Lucky Thirteen - great companion short to terms of Enlistment
This story is a nice addition to the Terms of Enlistment universe. If you liked one, you'll enjoy the other. Nice to see the world from Lt. Halley's point of view, and as a pilot the details of flying the drop ship worked for me. I enjoyed this short, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes this genre.
