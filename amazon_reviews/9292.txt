Easy to use.
I have become very attached to my Roku as it is so much faster to download movies than my blue ray dvd player with internet capabilities. I enjoy Netflix very much (the best buy on TV Entertainment) and Roku makes it easy.  I do wish they had an optical sound output for my dolby system. I dont like running the picture through the amp, as I think it reduces picture quality, plus you have to have a big tuner on all the time, not just when you want to watch a good movie.  Overalll, a good product and the price was good, compared to local stores.
