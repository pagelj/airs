Awesome buy! Great price!
I purchased this radio because I wanted one with a screen for my 1 year old son! I searched high and low and found one that I liked and was reasonable in the price. I read the reviews on this radio and was even more confident that I should purchase it! I received it Wednesday and had it installed the next day! I was very pleased with the product! It's a wonderful radio at a fantastic price. I would recommend anyone to purchase this radio. It's more than what I expected and I'm very pleased with my selection! I'm not an electronic genius but I must say I did pretty good with this buy! It's very easy to operate and go from screen to screen. The color on the screen is AWESOME! My son loves it and I love it even more!
