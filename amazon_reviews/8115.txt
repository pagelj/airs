a good product
I have had my Miele Capricorn canister vacuum for 3+ years now and it still does a fantastic job. these bags are the only ones I buy and the best price, especially taking the free shipping into consideration.(amazon prime) They are small, but so is the canister of the vacuum. I have a fairly large house and vacuum once a week. i change the bag roughly once a month.
