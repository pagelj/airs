Not too sure about these
Batteries arrived USPS in a reasonable amount of time.  Was not very happy to find they were not packaged as pictured.  One of the battery packages was already opened and the other was questionable.  Tested both batteries and they were in the green but only about 25% in the green.  They both work okay but not sure just how long they will last.  Time will tell. At $1.00 each I guess you get what you pay for.
