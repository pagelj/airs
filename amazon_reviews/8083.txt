It worked, period.
I spent approximately $1.65 including shipping. The cable worked as advertised. At first I saw a garbled screen, but eventually realized that my older model projection TV didn't display 1080p. Once I reduced the input to 720p or 1080i I had success. I couldn't tell you if this cable would work in a hard core application, but then most people in that circumstance wouldn't buy so cheap a cable.
