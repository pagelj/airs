Great product, but it needs You tube and Vudu!
I am impressed with it's performance, and 1080p video looks great through Vimeo, but you can't get you tube on it anymore, and I would like to see Vudu for 1080p movies. I don't use netflix 'cause on demand selection sucks, and I am hoping they find a 1080p source soon, the product displays it great!
