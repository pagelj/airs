Excellent product, excellent price!
Been using this product for about six weeks so far and have no complaints.  In fact, it's kind of boring... it just sits there - which is a good thing! Installation is drop-dead simple, but a bit tricky to do solo. Currently mounted two Acer X233h 23" LCDs and have no issues with weight or stability. They can swivel left and right, though I don't do it much. Take a solid product, give it a fair (even "cheap") price and ship it quickly, you get a very satisfied customer. 10/10, imo.
