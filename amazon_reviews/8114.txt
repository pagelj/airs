A fun and interesting little game
I enjoyed this game, and considered the money spent to buy it a worthwhile expenditure.  However I must say that many of the challenges are solved more by random trial and error and trying to figure out what the developer was thinking rather then by using any existing knowledge of physics or very much common sense for that matter. Interesting and fun concept, but fun is reduced to less than stellar quality through the awkward design of the levels.
