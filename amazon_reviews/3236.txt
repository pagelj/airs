Perfect for my S-95
I ordered this case because I saw a review that said it had room for the camera and an extra battery or memory card.  It fits the camera PERFECTLY!  And, it does have adequate space for 2 extra batteries and a memory card or two without being bulky or cumbersome.  I couldn't be more pleased.  I rated the Protection at a 4 because it is a soft case - not a hard case.  In my thinking, a soft case can't provide as much protection as a hard case.  That being said, the soft case meets my needs better than a hard case would.
