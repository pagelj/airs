Keeps the Girls Overnight
I bought one of these so I could have any size/type of cell charger available for my random hook-ups who try the ole "My phone is dying and I gotta get home to charge it 'cuz I need it for my job/business/kids/dying mother" what have you. I just bust out with this number and ask, "Does this fit?" She has no other choice but to nod, plug in, and enjoy the glass of wine I poured for her while I went to retrieve one of my assorted chargers. Call it my little "insurance" plan, heh heh.
