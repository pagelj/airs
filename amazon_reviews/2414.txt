Not working a few months later
I bought this in July 2010. It was great when it worked! A few months later, it stopped working. It was not damaged in any way, but it no longer turns on. In addition, the battery door does not open normally. This is actually the second Nikon I owned. I had bought a L18 that stopped working too. I will stop buying these affordable cameras. I would rather invest more money in something that won't break. Will be selling it for parts...
