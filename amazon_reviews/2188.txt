Cross My Heart
A conservative, straight laced, heart surgeon who is also a single dad and a sexy rock musician who just happens to be house-sitting for her aunt living next door, get to know one another because of his 14 year old teenage daughter who is visiting him for two weeks during the summer. What starts off as a request to impress his daughter by introducing her to the rockstar to improve their father-daughter relationship, becomes so much more when sparks fly between the pair when these two opposites attract. Very well written I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
