As good as the first time
I read this some years ago, and tried it again as a free Kindle download.  I liked it just as much the second time. I loved the characers.  There is a tad too much info about the actual 30 years war, but I skipped over most of it and missed nothing.  Those interested in European history will love the details. I loved that the town decides to keep being Americans.  The girls wear short skirts and join the army.  The refugees have to read and agree to the bill of rights.  Religious freedom is honored. I also liked that the people of 1600 do not fall down in fear before things like pick up trucks. The author makes it clear that they knew about some sorts of engines and could make the leap to explain what they were seeing.  If you like time travel or alternate history, this is the book for you.
