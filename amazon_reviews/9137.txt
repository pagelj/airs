love it for the most part
When I got the blu ray player it was easy to set up.  I connected to my wireless internet quickly and have been enjoying Netflix, YouTube, and other internet apps on my TV.  I could be happier with the player though.  Sometimes if I stop in the middle of a DVD it will save my place and continue the next time I turn it on, other times it won't.  When I turn the player back on it will start back at the beginning of the disc and will turn subtitles on even though I never turned them on before.  So almost half the time I need to turn the subtitles off and go back to find my place in the show.
