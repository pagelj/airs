I would recommend it to everyone.
I researched DVD players for a while and was ready to buy a Panasonic because my plasma 50 is a Panasonic.  I changed my mind after reading many reviews stating that the Panasonic repeatedly dropped the wifi signal while streaming.  I then looked at reviews of Sony players and saw that their interface had been updated and their wifi was very stable.  When the S390 went on sale for $88 i got it and could not be happier.  The set up took about 10 minutes and has worked flaulessly on all of its functions. The interface is fine and it is so small it is almost invisible sitting on my cable box.  I really am happy with it.
