My current vacuum is a Dyson, which I loved and wanted for years before I actually made the purchase.  Although it's a good vacuum, it is too heavy to lug up and down the 3 sets of stairs I have in my house to vacuum up the crumbs/dirt/hair my kids and my giant log leave behind with every step they take. I was happy to receive the Hoover WindTunnel AIR Upright, mostly because I thought I'd be able to vacuum easily and without breaking my back. I liked a number of things about the Hoover WindTunnel AIR Upright. It is light. Very easy to carry around. The design and look is nice. It also came pretty much fully put together in the box - assembly was very little. I truly love the bagless vacuums. I don't think I'll ever go back to a vacuum with a bag again. It is so easy to empty - just remove the canister, hold it over the garbage and press the button to empty it. You can also easily take out the filter, wash it and replace it. The handle also comes down pretty far so I can get under furniture must more easily than with my big bulky Dyson. For this size vacuum, the suction power was amazing. Lastly, it's definitely one of the quietest vacuums I've ever had. Now the cons. Also the assembly was minimal (it came pretty much put together in the box), the instructions on how to use the attachment and functions leave a lot to be desired. I went through the book a number of times, convinced I was missing something because I couldn't figure out what the different modes meant. A big con - in my house, we have a number of area rugs. I am not sure what the reason - maybe the suction is too strong, maybe it's not powerful enough - but the vacuum can not clean my rugs. On carpet and wood floors, it did a great job.**I received a sample of this product to facilitate my review, but my opinions are entirely my own.**
