Scarleton Large Shoulder Bag
I like the size and the feel.  It has enough room for my purse items and my necessities for work.  The only thing I don't like are the handles.  The arm straps are unsightly and sag when using the shoulder strap and cannot be used as shoulder straps.  The shoulder strap is wimpy.  I would have preferred a wide permanently connected shoulder strap and no arm (short straps).  If the arm staps were 6 inces longer they could be over the shoulder or arm.
