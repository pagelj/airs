works great so far
when I saw the monitor I worried because it felt a little cheap.  we decided to buy this monitor because it was cheaper than the others on the market and had pretty good reviews.  been using it for a couple months now and it works great.  at first it bothered me that the image always stayed on making our room very bright but realized that I can turn off the camera to dim the unit.  been working great and i'd definitely recommend this product.  also, i'm impressed with infant optics' customer service.  I had a question about the unit and received an email back from the company very fast.
