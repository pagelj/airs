I got this gadget after much debate and lots of laundry washed by hand. My primary intent was cloth diaper washing but have found its impressive with reg clothing too! I have done several loads in it so far and am shocked at how dirty the water was when draining it. I have never seen such grudge come out of clothes that were not even VISIBLY dirty. I am doubting ever going back to an automatic machine. As for the washer, it was very simple to assemble, and very easy to use. I know a lot of ppl say the base doesn't seem sturdy, but so far no issues with mine. The only major downside is, you need to wring the clothes out either by hand, a wringer mop bucket, or get their portable spinner. I think I may invest in the spinner down the road after its been out a while longer (they recently released a new version) and I get to see more reviews on it. I currently wring with a pro yellow mop bucket I got at menards for 49. ish dollars. I also ordered the easy dry portable dryer which I am waiting on to arrive. Will review it later. I do recommend this washer! It's fantastic!
