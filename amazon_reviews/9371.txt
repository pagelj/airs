Great tiny netbook!
Got it last week from Bestbuy. It's pretty much what I expected at this price level. It's small and compact, and is pretty quick. Performance is fair enough for surfing the internet, emails, pictures, video and music. The battery life is approximately 3.5 hours, give or take. I would like to have a 6 cell lithium ion battery instead of the 3 cell, but I don't know if they have 6 cell available for this particular netbook. The only complaint comes from the keyboard which I feel a little difficult to type because it's 93% of a normal sized keyboard. Overall, it's a great netbook for your daily use.
