The best app for browsing movies.
These days I don't buy a paper and using Flixster is a better solution anyway. The times and theaters seem to be aleays up to date. The special notes as to Imax or 3D are also there. When I travel I like having Flixster in case I don't want to spend another lonely night in a hotel room. Great product that is an essential app.
