I have had my set for almost one year.  I loved the set at first, but now that I am looking at it and it isn't even a year old, I think the quality is not all that great.  For about 4 or 5 months now, one of the smaller cutting knives has been rusting.  Now I see that the block, that sits on my counter and only gets moved when I clean the counter is starting to crack down the front.  The set that I replaced this with was a lot cheaper and I never had any problems with any of the knives or the block.  Only replaced it because I wanted a brown block instead of black.  Now I'm starting to regret my purchase.
