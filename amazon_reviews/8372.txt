I am going to buy this!
(Im on my brothers amazon by the way) When I first saw this bag, I said, this is EXACTLY what I want! I saw the reviews and its OUTSTANDING , thats what I read :D I read that it holds many books , and thats good since im going to highschool. Its very stylish which will make my friends VERY jealous! I read that it came with brown straps (that was only one review) but I dont think that will happend to me since I buy many things on amazon and that rarely happends. Well, I hope its as good as every one says it is! UPDATE:I just ordered it :D Cant wait for it to come :DUPDATE2:Just got it like 4 weeks ago but I forgot to do the update XD, anyways, It DID have a ''funky smell'' to it but its wearing away. It fits alot! I put 6 notebooks, a binder,my pencils and calculater and everything else, and STILL have space left! What your waiting for? BUY THIS BAG! [Did come in a cunfusingly small package but dont worry! ;)]
