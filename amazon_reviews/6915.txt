Our first Cuisinart CHW-12 programmable coffeemaker stopped perking, when on the timer setting, after a couple of weeks of use; it would stop perking after brewing a few cups and then shut off.  We returned it and received an identical replacement.  The new one worked for a week and then it also quit perking after brewing a few cups, when set to timer.  It currently works O. K., when set to manual brewing; and, it stays on all day with manual setting applied.
