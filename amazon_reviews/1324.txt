Backpack
Finally something we agreed on!  I really like how roomy this backpack is and it has a large pocket in front for her to keep all the markers/hi-lighters/pencils/index cards etc. required!!  She loved the black & white pattern and the shoulder strapps are well cushioned! I don't know how they carry all those books!
