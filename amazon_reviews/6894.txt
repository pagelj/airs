If you're one of those folks who is trying to discontinue spending $4-$5 daily on a coffee drink this machine comes ever so close to weaning yourself off that spend. My wife commented that she wanted her favorite soy latte drink at home and asked me to be the home barista. I frankly have little to no desire to be grinding coffee and pulling shots in my spare time so I checked Amazon for a "latte maker". The reviews looked good but I was skeptical that this machine would do the trick at $99. After having 3 drinks thus far I can report that this machine delivers on the goods. We like our drinks extra hot and favor Starbucks when it comes to soy lattes. Using Silk Vanilla soy milk (just like Sbux) along with Sbux Espresso Roast (also available on Amazon) this comes ever so close to replicating our same favorite $4 drink. It's close enough that most days I'm going to fire this machine up and save a few $ in the long run. I strongly recommend checking out the Sbux Espresso roast for your favorite drink and giving this machine a try. Starbucks Dark Espresso Roast Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3) It may very well be the most convenient and tastiest coffee drink you can make at home without spending a lot of time and money on a super fancy machine. Quite easy to clean as well.
