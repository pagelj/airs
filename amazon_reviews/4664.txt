Great burner for the pice
Well, for the amount I paid for it I have to say it was a hell of a deal.  I have used this burner 9 times now to boil water.  Works great.  I have used this in 65 degrees and 12 degrees.  Functions flawlessly.  They say shipping could take up to 1 month, however, I received mine in 10 days.  Bonus!
