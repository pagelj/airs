so far, so good
this is turning out to be the best ipod holder i've had. it's very sturdy. the CD slot fitting is genius. and the best part is the removable clip at the bottom because i usually plug both my auxiliary cord and ipod cord in and with all other holders it made my ipod rise up off the holder. the side clips on this are very strong too. i highly recommend this over any other i've seen or used.
