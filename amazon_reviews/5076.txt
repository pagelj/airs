Great
This is the best streamer EVER! Get the Plex media server online for free and the Roku will play any video file format you can throw at it. The streaming is very smooth unlike the PS3, the Roku has NO lag when I am streaming HUGE video files. I'm so happy with my purchase and you will be too!
