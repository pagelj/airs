Wallet? Yeah, sure.
Yay! I found the exact item I wanted that fits my needs perfectly! Then I received the item. Great, my phone fits. Spiffy. But if you put more than 1 single item in the wallet section, that stupid weak magnet won't hold closed. How am  I supposed to use it as a "wallet," if I can't put anything except my phone in it? The closure needs to be stretchy/elastic in nature in order to accommodate the contents, or else the magnet/closure needs to be modified. If you want a spiffy phone holder for cheap, you found it! If you want to use it for its intended purpose? Keep moving on to the next product. Oh, and let me know if you find one that WORKS.
