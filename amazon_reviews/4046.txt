One of the greatest moments of my life
My boyfriend and I had the privilege of seeing Sade live in concert on July 6, 2011 in Boston. Our seats were 6th row center! The show was absolutely amazing. The moment Sade took the stage, we were up out of our seats. Her voice, the band, and sets took my breath away. Looking around in the crowd, it was great to see all of the different groups of people who love and are moved by her music. Sade is timeless!!! That day will forever be etched in my brain as one of the greatest moments of my life!!!!
