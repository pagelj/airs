Pleasantly Surprised
Was in the market for a netbook to replace my Asus and I stumbled across the Chromebook. I have to say that I did not know ro much about them. I own a Kindle, and an Android phone along with 2 IPads so adding another electronic device is really the last thing I need but with the reviews and the price I could not pass this up. I have only had it 5 days but I absolutely love it. I'm definitely still learning all the things it can do but it is my #1 go to computer. Here is a list of pros/cons.- Love the design, very lightweight- great graphics- very fast start up. 6 or 7 seconds-The touch pad is awesome and easy to use. Finally ditched my mouse-Price-Overall a great machineCons-Still trying to figure out how to print to a non cloud printer. I actually did it but not exactly sure how.-Syncing all my Chrome OS devices was a bit tricky. I kept getting a passphrase error but it went away after syncing phone and other devices together.-Webcam is pretty crummy and doesn't work all of the time-No skype. I will try Google talk. Overall I recommend the Chromebook. Well built and the price is right.
