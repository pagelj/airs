After spending a lot of time reading reviews, and waiting practically a year to make the right choice to replace my old thermal coffee pot I decided on the Melitta 46894 model and purchased it in Feb 2012.  I was very excited when it arrived. I had family guests coming to visit and it arrived just in time for the gang. The first pot I brewed the coffee was not very hot, after my house guests left I took the time to read instructions and started to wait for a few minutes after coffee brewed to pour coffee into cup, giving the heating plate time to heat up the pot. Still not hot enough. I now fill carafe with hot water for a few minutes prior to brewing and pouring water out(waste of water and extra step to wait for coffee)then set to brew. It is still not hot enough for our taste. UGH!!! Also the heating plate is rusting. I am looking to replace this coffee maker. My old thermal Mr. Coffee maker that I had for seven years makes hotter coffee than this. I am very disappointed with this coffeemaker,after I took so much time researching, I had very high expectations. I need to replace this coffee maker before winter as we do not want lukewarm coffee on a cold winter morning!!! For coffee lovers lukewarm coffee first thing in the morning just doesn't do it. Any recommendations???? UPDATE:Dec. 13, 2012I contacted Melitta in Sept. 2012. I explained how my coffee maker did not make hot coffee and that the heating plate was rusted and it was only six months old. They told me they would replace this coffee maker but they were on back order and would notify me when as soon as they come in. I have emailed and called Melitta customer service every month after that. Their response every month is the same "We have not forgotten you and as soon as they come in we will contact you" I am very disappointed and have given up. I will be purchasing a new thermal coffee maker as soon as I find one with execellent reviews. It will not be a Melitta Hamilton Beach Product.
