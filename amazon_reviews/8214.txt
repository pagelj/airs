Love this series
I bought the original Wool book awhile back and I've recommended it to several friends.  I like the uniqueness of the world the story takes place in and I never realized there was a followup book to the series.  One of my friends which I recommended the first book to told me the other day that he was just finishing up this book and wanted to know what I thought about it.  I was stunned and excited!  I immediately purchased this one. I'm not going to go into the story at all, but I do want to say that I actually enjoyed the second book more than the original! So after looking into the author a little more, I'm excited to see that there might be a movie as well.  How cool!  I also looked into other titles by HH and purchased I, Zombie and the first book of one of his other series.  I definitely have found another favorite author!
