The machine works but for $30 more you can buy the one that I have at home. This one wad for the office. It isn't horrible it is a little different though. The $70 Mr. Coffee expresso, latte, and cappucino machine is great for the price. It has a big water tank and works great for steam and expresso. Update 12/27/12. It isn't that bad. After using it for a couple of more days I am used to the weird kind of expresso that it makes. Overall it is a good started machine for making expresso but I would not recommend it for someone who wants real expresso.
