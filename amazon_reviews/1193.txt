Love at First Sight
If you love a good romance then you will adore Maid for Love. This book was captivating from the start. As I was reading it, I was excited to see if there were more in the series available! Maddie is such a strong person and great single mother. Mac is a true prince charming. How he goes about winning Maddie over is so sweet. I love how quickly he loves little Thomas as well. I can't wait to read book 2 in the series with Janie and Joe.
