KINDLE FIRE CASE
The case fits perfectly, provides protection from damage in a fall, works well as a stand to enable viewing the screen at various angles and is very well made. The case provides access to the USB Micro charging/data port, on/off switch, mic connection, as well as the speakers. I have no complaints whatsoever with this product.
