Great rechargeable battery system
The Eneloop system is great, particular for digital cameras or other electronic systems that may lie dormant for a number of weeks/months between uses. The batteries will keep the majority of their charge where a standard rechargeable will lose its charge over the same period and require a recharge. This charger seems to work great with them and will give you a full charge of 4AAA/AA over night.
