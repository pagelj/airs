Great Dog Backpack
I chose this product based on the other reviews, and was not disappointed.  Excellent quality and lots of packing room (water bottles, rolls and rolls of poop bags, etc. etc.).  Seems comfortable with two straps under the belly and a chest strap that keeps it nearer the shoulders, reducing strain to the back.  Dog seems to be fine with it, but does bounce off of mailboxes from time to time.  I like it because she gets more exercise on a walk and seems to think she's on a mission, which is good for dogs who live a cushy life.  Only criticism is that it only comes in the one almost-pink color.  I have a girl pitbull named Maybelline, so she wears it very well, but boy dogs could be made fun of by the others... Still 5 stars
