I love this thing. I have kids and a VW camper van - needless to say, I use this thing a lot. The cord on this vac allows me to reach everywhere, has super powerful suction (it's hard to believe it runs off a 12v cigarette lighter), the circular trash cavity is a cinch to empty and it folds down small enough to store behind the driver's seat. My van's carpets and upholstery stay clean and I don't have to be at home to get out the big house vacuum to keep it that way, I just pull this thing out wherever we are and a few minutes later things look great. I'm used to those battery-powered chargeable hand vacs that work great for 2 weeks and then can't compete with the gravity of a single cheerio afterwards - this vac blows them all away. I will never buy another battery-powered hand vac. I'm actually considering getting a 12v converter so I can use this thing in the house.
