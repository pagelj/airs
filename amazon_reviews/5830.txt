A bit too brief for it's scope
Unfortunately, this book tries to do to much and falls a bit flat. It tries to be; an introduction to python, tkinter, pygame, a general introduction to the Raspberry Pi, the RPi hardware, RPi breakout boards, and finally thin. This last item really kills the gigantic scope it set out to be. However, the book's brevity is also the author's greatest strength. It's a thin volume that's well written, easy to get through, and a good price. It contains a reasonable introduction to python starting from simple commands up to GUI's with Tkinter and pygame, and covers the data structures and conventions fine. However, and likely because it is so thin, there is some subtlety that is glossed over, and I would recommend another python book to supplement it. Regarding the Pi itself, it gives some basic tutorials on what it is, how to connect everything, and how to get running on it. But if you've ordered a Pi, I would suspect you can find all of this out for yourself on the web. Also as the pi software evolves, it's going to get a bit out of date. There is also a substantial section dedicated to Pi breakout boards, but is nothing more than a catalog listing of parts. Finally, there are some projects, but unless you've also bought the hardware to go along with them only the clock will be accessible (the parts can certainly be bought at the local electronics store). Still on this last point the author uses his own hardware, so if you decide to get the hardware, this book would be an excellent resource. In the end, this is an okay quick resource, but you may be better off going with two books that go more in-depth into 1) python and 2) rasperry pi hardware and electronics.
