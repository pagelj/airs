If you love the games, you'll love this
This book is for fans of the video game series, through and through. If you enjoy the games (especially Halo 4!), you'll love reading this. You get a lot of insight into how many of the character's stories begin and the background of the war against the Covenant. There are lots of 'aha!' moments that link into elements of the story shown in the games. That said, I think someone picking this up off a shelf with no prior knowledge of the Halo universe would enjoy it as well. The book is well-written and doesn't baby the reader - it explains most of its military acronyms through story progression rather than by pausing the narrative every five minutes for explanations. All-in-all, this is a military sci-fi book that does the game series justice.
