Good so far
Bought a pretty expensive monitor when we had our first child and it definitely let us down, so after seeing good reviews on this one we decided we would try this one. An obvious PLUS for being at lower end of the pricing scale on the market. My son is four months old and we have finally placed him out of the crib and into his own room. It is great to be able to have this next to us so that we can see him safe and sound next door. Really easy to set up and the battery seems to be OK but I keep it pluggeed in most of the time. My part of this monitor is that it is so silent after a while without any noise. It works well all around our house. We use it mostly at night which is great with good infrared night vision. It looks a bit like a toy but it definitely has been working great.
