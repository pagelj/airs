I HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH MY NEW  EGG TOASTER AND I CANT BELIEVE HOW SIMPLE, YET EFFECTIVE IT IS.  IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS THE EGGS COME OUT EXACTLY AS PLANNED.  BE IT SOFT MED OR HARD THE SYSTEM IS JUST ABOUT GOOFPROOFBECAUSE YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF THE QUALITY IS SUPERB. I LIKE MY TOAST AND MUFFINS LIGHT BUT IF YOU LIKE THEM REALLY DARK YOU NEED TO EXPERIMENT A LOT TO GET JUST THE RIGHT DARKNESSADDING PRE COOKED HAM OR MEAT {AS LONG AS ITS NOT FROZEN} IS A GREAT BENEFITI THINK MY EGG MUFFINS ARE BETTER THAN MCDONALDSI HOPE IT LASTS FOREVER
