YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Epic in its scope, sweeping in its unhidden philosophical implications, this movie is a call to arms for everyone fed up with corporatism-militarism and profiteering at all costs that is endemic to our body politic and culture. There are those who will go through all sorts of rationalizations to deny this, to tell us that it is JUST a movie and that it has no meaning, no implications, no significance whatever beyond mindless entertainment. But there is a prompt and overwhelming refutation of that point of view to be had immediately - WATCH THE MOVIE. A MAGNIFICENT achievement at all levels.  Many thanks to James Cameron and the thousands of people and long hours of work involved in producing this blockbuster! Also, I have not yet checked, having just seen it, but I hope their will be a novelization of this great film ... with the idealogical parts included! And if there are more complete versions of it coming out later in the year, I'll be happily getting those too! Thanks again!
