LOVE THIS MONITOR!!
My husband and I had purchased a regular baby monitor (sound only) but we were getting frusturated with hearing our son fuss but then not knowing if he could get back to sleep on his own or not. We bought this monitor and LOVE IT! The camera is small enough that it doesn't look ridiculous (we mounted it on the wall by his crib) and has awesome picture quality (even w/ the night vision feature). The handheld portion is lightweight (almost seems cheap.. but so far no issues) and again AWESOME picture quality. My only complaint is the battery life of the monitor. THe camera stays plugged in so that obviously does not die, but the monitor portion loses battery life fairly quickly. We keep ours plugged in all night but if we try to keep it on all day it dies. My advice would be to turn it off when your baby is not napping to conserve the battery. We only have this issue on weekends when he is napping at home (otherwise during the week he is at daycare and we only use it at night). All in all an awesome product. For the price--you can't get anything better!
