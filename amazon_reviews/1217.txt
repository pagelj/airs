Could not finish
I made it to chapter 4 and had to stop.  I did like the world building and some of the tech, but that was it. The prologue was brutal, but forced my way through it anyways.  Read like a comic book or a sci-fi b-film.  It was a little smoother after that, but not enought to hold my interest. What really forced me to put this book down was the protagonist fainting.  Really?  That situation was the least of his worries. Leave your brain at the door and this might be an ok read.
