Froze after 2hr and would not turn back on
I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews, but considering the price during Amazon's lightning deals, I decided to give it a shot. I received it in just a few days, so +10pts for Amazon's speedy shipping. I finally set it up today after purchasing a new tv. The set-up was quick and easy, and it recognized my network immediately; however, I only got 2 bars whereas my laptop in the same room gets 5. Netflix worked fine, as did YouTube. To access more functions, however, it prompted me to update the Firmware. As I attempted to do this, it froze while connecting to the network (even though it was still technically connected based on viewing the devices accessing my network). The only way to get off that screen was to manually press the power button on the player; the remote didn't work. Now, it won't turn back on. Saying that I am disappointed is an understatement. I'm keeping fingers crossed that returning it will be hassle free.
