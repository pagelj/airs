Great phone!
I have had my fair share of phones but this by far is the best yet. I was trying to decide between this and the samsung galaxy. After reading the reviews and comparing specs I decided on this one. It is half the price but just as good of a phone. My favorite thing about the phone is how big the screen is. The only com[plaint I have is that i wish the battery life was longer.
