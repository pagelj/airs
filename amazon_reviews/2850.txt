Love our Miele
Great vacuum, great bag. Just wish they were a little cheaper. After getting new carpet we filled up three bags in one vacuuming with all the remnant carpet strands from the install. On bag number 3 I decided to manually pull the carpet strands out of the bang while over the outside garbage can. This allowed us to reuse it.
