Review on Philips DVD Player
I'm not tech savvy but this was so easy to set up. I love how I am able to watch downloaded movies - much affordable practice compared to renting or buying movies. :) I checked at a popular retail store for gadgets like this and they cost more than a hundred dollars - so this was a steal! Luv, luv this product!
