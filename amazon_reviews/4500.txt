Easy Application - Does the Job
I normally have my husband apply screen protectors for me because he is more precise and just better at it in general. I received my Kindle Fire and Screen Protector on my afternoon break during my working hours. Therefore, I took it back to work and was so anxious to check it out that I opened it at work at my desk. I got brave and decided to apply the screen protector myself. A small towel is included to wipe the screen before application. It was very easy to put on. I had no problems whatsoever. I have no problems with screen response or glare. I recommend this product.
