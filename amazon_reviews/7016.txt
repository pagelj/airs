For women.
This movie has excellent cinematography in the first half. (the beach, the apartment) Other than that the script is really bad. The main female character's ponderings on how men treat women are misguided. She is  basically troubled and needs to get help. Her boyfriend is causing her  great emotional pain, by refusing any sexual contact, but that is also her  problem, she should leave him, he provides nothing for her. The sex is  amazingly BORING, there is no passion, no atmosphere, no intensity, and no  love. Its not a terrible movie or a classified B-movie, but it is not  written well. It could have been better if the script provided deeper  insights on the main character and allowed her more freedom to break out of  her misery and just get a new life. She is only falling down a dark spiral  trying to find out if sex can give her the love her boyfriend can not give  to her. This movie really kills your libido.
