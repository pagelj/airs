Terrible vacuum. I have a cat and a dog, of course both shed so i need to vacuum a few times a week.  I have to clean out the vacuum multiple times when vacuuming my living room and bedroom. And cleaning it is a nuisance! Dirt does not stay in the canister! It spreads throughout the entire vacuum and if the filters are cleaned thoroughly after each use the vacuum won't even suck up a cobweb!  Also it seems to keep a pet odor that spreads every time i turn it on. Now i have had my cat for 9 years and my dog for over a year and i never noticed the smell with my last vacuum.  This vacuum is worthless! I find myself vacuuming the same room at least twice to get a satisfied cleaning and then usually i am just giving up.
