We've now had four different brands of espresso machines. We've had a Starbuck's Barista, a Gaggia Baby, this DeLonghi, and now we have a Saeco to replace the DeLonghi. We had to buy this De Longhi from a local store instead of Amazon, because we needed a new espresso machine right away. My big treat is a latte with breakfast every day and our Gaggia Baby was broken. This machine made a decent latte using a pod and the foaming wand worked very well. The small size is also great. The foaming wand must be removed for cleaning every time the machine is used and the tip of the wand is difficult to screw on and off. It felt like it was going to break every time I removed it. The wand on the left was awkward to use, we're used to having the wand on the right. This machine is the most poorly made item we've ever owned. After about 2 weeks, the bottom fell out of the water reservoir! There are tiny little legs at the bottom and one of them cracked open at the spot where the plastic was joined. There was no way to work around that problem. I emailed the company to tell them about this defect and asked for a replacement, but never got a response after waiting for 2 weeks. We then called them and they are sending a replacement, but charging us $17 for it. That just doesn't seem like good customer service to us. This is a very cheap machine even at the higher price we paid to buy it locally, and we didn't expect it to last long. If we'd gotten 6 months use out of it, we would have been very happy with that. We would gladly have paid $100 more for a similar design that was made better. Because of the company's complete indifference to their own warrantee, we would not want to buy any more DeLonghi products.
