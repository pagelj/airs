Perfect for the Paperwhite.
This is the perfect accessory for the Kindle Paperwhite. It gives the reader a "book like" feel. The best feature to me is that when you close the cover, it turns the device off, and when you open the cover it turns it on. No more trying to get my finger on the very small on/off button.
