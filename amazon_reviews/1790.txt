Very Nice Bag
This is a very nice bag.  The material isn't too cheap and is sturdy.  A great find for the price.  It comes with a shoulder strap, and the clasps are very nice.  I didn't realize it was a snake skin type of pattern, but it doesn't throw off the bag too much.  The packaging was very nice.  Its a pretty big bag, if you are used to small ones.  There's a cell phone/sun glasses pocket, plus a zipper pocket on the inside.  There is also a zipper pocket on the outside.  It looks good with or without the strap.  It's 15" l at the bottom by 9"h.  I would recommend this bag.
