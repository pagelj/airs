Great Pack!
I purchased the penguin backpack for my son in the fall and he and I loved it!! I bought him the frog one for spring and he really wanted a green backpack. The quality is great and the price is right. I love the small size. He is 3 and tall for his age but it fits perfect. It also washes off easily with a sponge.
