Enough pockets to keep stuff
Its a good bag, sturdy, well made, so many pockets, I could spend a life time figuring out where is my stuff. I find it slightly tall in size. I am above 6 foot so still fits me BUT if you go by the picture it will be bigger than the usuall backpacks. Overall worth every penny.
