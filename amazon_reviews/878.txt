Holds a charge well
I've been getting over 600 RAW shots off of a charge in my 7D (very little flash use, and even then I don't really use the in-camera flash). Considering I'm just a hobbyist who doesn't have much time during the week to go out and shoot, I'm satisfied with a battery lasting me a week before recharging.
