Happy photo bug....
I love this camera!  Wish it came with a slightly larger zoom lens but will have to do for now.  The difference in the pictures (this vs. reg. digital) are clear immediately.  I especially love the fact that I have the ability to let it auto decide settings or do a manual takeover :)  Gives me plenty of room to learn the slr features while allowing me the ability to take those need now pics.  Only downside I saw, like I said before, the zoom lens that comes with the camera (14-42mm) just won't cut it for more than a good landscape or portrait.
