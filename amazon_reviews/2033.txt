This is exactly what we were looking for.  I use 13gal tall kitchen bags and they are just the right size.  For two of us who cook at home just about every night and basically throw everything in this and a small can in the bathroom, it still holds enough to only have to empty once a week.  It looks great, fits right under the counter and the lid doesn't hit it every time it opens like our old stainless canister.  I've only had it a month so hoping the 4xD batteries last awhile... they are somewhat expensive.  Overall great value compared to all the others I saw and thank GOODNESS I don't have to have two bins or that paper bag sitting next to my trash anymore!
