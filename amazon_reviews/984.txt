Replaces my 1D MkIII
I've been looking to replace my 1D MkIII and expected to buy a 1D MkIV. I held off, waiting to see actual photographic results and was somewhat disappointed when they finally hit the web. $5k is a lot for what looks like an incremental improvement -- especially when the 7D, while not quite up to 1D MkIV quality, has such an exceptional price point. After seeing the results and working with a friend's 7D I was sold. At 8 fps, the 7D is only 2 fps slower than the 1D when it comes to shooting wildlife and sports. At 18 mpx, it's even better than the 1D MkIV although the MkIV has a somewhat larger sensor (1.3 vs. 1.6, which should produce lower noise). Still, when you can buy three 7D's for the cost of a 1D MkIV, what's not to like? Image noise is excellent up to ISO 800 - and beyond in a pinch. New interface features such as the "Q" quick setup are exceptional. I added a vertical grip to give me extra battery capacity in the field. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because compared to both my old 1D MkIII and my old 5D, the function switch on the camera back has a cheap feel to it. It's certainly not the rugged build quality of the 1D series. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my 7D and I would recommend it to anyone, amateur or professional. In the end, I also bought a 5D MkII to go with my new 7D. This gives me the absolute best of both worlds - the 7D's 1.6X sensor extends my telephotos for wildlife shooting and the full frame 5D gives me great wide angle landscapes. And the total cost for both was still 15% cheaper than a 1D MkIV.
