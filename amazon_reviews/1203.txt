Great customer service, good product
My 3 year old loves to play with my Ipod, but i made it clear that i dont want him to play with it on hard surfaces, while bringing it to me, he dropped the ipod on my concrete porch. I went to apple who quoted me $100 to "fix it", which included giving me a new one, refurbishing my old one, and then selling my old one for even more profit. Anyway, to get to the point, I ordered this replacement but unfortunately the first one was defective. I contacted the company, and within 3 days they sent me another full replacement kit! All I asked for was a new screen and with hardly any questions asked, they sent me another kit, complete with tools, 3m adhesive and a usb cable! I will say that the tools aren't enough to get into the Ipod initially, you will need a sharp, metal blade of some kind, aside from that, the rest of the tools will do the job from there. Take it slow and remember where your screws came from, also ensure all connections are secure and test the Ipod before sealing it with the adhesive.
