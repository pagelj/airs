Charges iPhone 5 well, but it doesn't charge my Google Nexus 7
I'm a little disappointed, I had another car charger with two USB outputs (which still works ok) but when I bought my Google Nexus 7, it didn't charge it. So the sole reason for buying a new one was to charge the tablet. The times I've tried to charge it with the "PowerGen 2.1Amps / 10W Dual USB Car charger Designed for Apple and Android Devices - White" it hasn't worked. I don't know if the battery can't be below certain level because it will require more Amps than the device can handle but when I've needed it, it hasn't delivered.
