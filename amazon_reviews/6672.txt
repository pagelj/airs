I read other reviews and decided to try this vacuum for upstairs. I just love it.  It almost drives itself!  I too wish the extension handle was a bit longer, but for me it works.  I have a lady come help me once in a while and she just loved it too.  Excellent vacuum for the money.  For any amount of money actually. D. M. San Diego
