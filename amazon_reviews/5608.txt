Not the one I looked for
The camera actually works, it records sound and image. I will be able to use it for something, if not as dashboard camera. And it is cheap. That's why it gets two stars. However, this is just a cheapo Chinese copy of the camera I was looking for. That one I bought somewhere else on the internet about 6 months ago. I was satisfied with it, and wanted to buy a second one for the other car. Then I run into this cheapo copy. Its price is about 1/3 of the real one. It looks exactly the same. However, it is not the same. Its field of view is much less and it doesn't record in real HD. The quality of this piece of junk is below VHS. You can set the recording quality in the menu up to 1280x960 but I believe this is just interlacing of a 360x240 image. The CMOS image sensor light sensitivity is poor and it becomes grainy in lower light conditions. Don't buy. Look elsewhere. Pay real dollars for a real camera. Update: I used it for one day. The sound is distorted, unintelligible. The field of view is the same as a 50mm objective with a small film camera, no way "wide". You can't see the traffic lights in front of you: how you can argue you passed in yellow? The image quality is terrible: you can't read the license plate of the car directly in front of you, except when you stand right behind with a few feet gap. The capital letters of overhead directional signs are legible only when you pass "under" them, of course as permitted by the poor field of view. This camera worth about $20, not much more and don't expect to measure up with the original, identically looking real HD camera that is called Trek View. I will try to add a video to demonstrate the poor quality.
