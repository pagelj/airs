video ok but audio terrible
We purchased this camera to use as a baby monitor w our phones and tablet.  The video is ok and nightvision is cool, but the audio is terrible.  We placed one of our phones blaring near the mic and you can hardly make out the music ther squelch is so loud.  We have adjusted the squelch but it either doesnt play any audio or its just static.  Going to call the seller and see if this is a flaw w the camera or just a crappy product.
