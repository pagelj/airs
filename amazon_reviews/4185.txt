I didn't care for how hard it was to get this glare screen film on the kindle screen. The small stckers that had to be removed to apply it left some real bad & hard to get of glue residue on the film. The instructions were not that clear. I went through all three of them before saying to hell with it. I would like my moeny back or for them to send me a better updateed version of the anti glare filters. Perferably ones with MUCH easier tape tags to remove without all the goop left behind. Real drag and I felt a waste of my money. The oniginal Kindle screen works just fine wihtout the add on anti-glare ones.
