I like the fact that the vacuum cleaner is lightweight for going up and down stairs. But the suction is not as good as the rebuilt kenmore I owned for over 10 years. The on/off and other switches being down on the canister mean bending over every time I want to change the controls. The kenmore had controls right on the handle at my fingertips. Living in a rural area far from a city that sells vacuum cleaners, I tried buying online, but I don't think I would do that again.
