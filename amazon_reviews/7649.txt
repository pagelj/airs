Good grief this man!!
I want to start of saying that I did like this book, it just had some things about it that bothered me. I liked Jesse, I thought he was hotness magnified! He just annoyed me when he kept telling "mouth", & to stop cursing, like really she's a grown woman, it became so redundant it started to become a turn-of. I love Alpha-males, & I like when they are possesive but not to the point when they become creepy & annoying, hince Jesse. The book was unnecessarily too long, & the sex scenes were good but too redundant as well, I love erotica, but not when it's the same scene over & over again. Other than that I think Jesse & Ava had great chemistry, the book had some good moments, I'm hoping the next one is much better & holds my attention.
