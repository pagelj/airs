Very good but not a DSLR substitute
A lot has already been written in other reviews about this product. I bought it to evaluate the possibility of replacing my DSLR with this, owing to the small size, lens change capability, and great quality pictures it is supposed to take. Now, don't get me wrong. This camera DOES capture great quality pictures and is lot better than the point-n-shoots. But, it is not a substitute for DSLR. I have a Nikon D60 since last 2.5 yrs and it was very difficult for me to get used to this camera. Exposure control using arrow keys is not easy if you are used to of using the rotating dials. I'd recommend it to those who want to upgrade from point-n-shoots but don't want to spend the money for DSLRs and carry those big cameras. And those who like to use Lensbaby Composer for Micro Four Thirds Digital Cameras with Tilt Transformer and do some creative, artistic photography.
