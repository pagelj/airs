Love my Panasonic Lumix SZ7!
I love this camera!  It takes wonderful pictures, zooms WAY in, perfect for sports shots of my Grandson's little league games.... great close-up flower shots, scenery.  The only thing I miss is a viewfinder.  The battery lasts a loooong time, I haven't even had t charge it yet!  I've taken lots of pictures, lots of zooming and "unzooming", playback, etc.
