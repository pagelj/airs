Purse Hoarder
I shop on amazon all the time and love to buy purses, totes, storage bags ect,ect. This particular purse I love! It is decribed as a satchel which it is in style. The leather or pleather feels great and it has a very sturdy bottom which makes for a non collapsing bag. The buckles are burnished and not at all shiny. It as not as large as it looks in the pics. I got it in the dark brown and I LOVE IT!! It is just big enough to hold my IPad and all of my other things which is a lot! No difficult middle pockets, small pockets on the outside and inside along with a space for phone or shades. Looks like I paid a fortune for it, but got it for under $30! So if it only lasts for 3 months its worth it!!!
