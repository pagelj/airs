Even if they gave them away, they are not worth the shipping and handling
I wish I had read all these reviews about rusty knives before I bought the bigger set times 2. My total order with shipping and handling was over $100 and I am so disatisfied with the quality. If they have any stainless steel in them at all it is the smallest amount they could possible use to still be able to say they are stainless steel.  Mine are barely 3 months old and they are covered with rust as if I left them outside in the woods all winter.  They get pitted from the rust and should not be used to cook and eat with, PERIOD!  I tried calling customer service back but got disconnected several times as they hear this complaint all day long.  Read the guarantee, it has a claus in it that says they will allow you to return and get your money back but there is a small fee PER knife and once you pay this fee you no longer have a return coming to you.  RONCO should have stuck to the "set-it-forget-it" rotiserie and not tried to market these unsafe knives.  This product and their customer service will ruin there reputation.  Instead of complaining to their ill-advised customer service you need to initiate a complaint with your state's Attorney General for Consumer Affairs.  Here is a separate note for Amazon - where are your standards that you would allow advertising for a product that has so many poor reviews, you need to protect your reputation too and ditch RONCO knives.
