No wifi, but there's a solution...
THis blue ray is great!  But since there is no Wifi connection available for it, I had quite the adventure trying different devices.  Since my router is the basement of my house and I certainly was not going to drill a hole in my floor to connect it, I was on the hunt for a wireless adapter/ device.  After trying 2 different netgear devices, i figured out that the USB port of the blue ray did not recognize the device. Then I got some advice from a friend that an iogear device only needs the LAN hookup to work.  So I ordered one from amazon, hooked it up on my computer, then plugged it in to the blue ray, hooked up the WPS, and bam! it worked! I just needed to confirm all network settings and update the firmware. After using neflix a few times, it got faster and faster! After about 4 times watching netflix, it doesn't need to load or buffer.  But I can wait the 2 minutes for a movie to load if it saves me from drilling holes or running wires all over my house!  and you really can't go wrong for the price!
