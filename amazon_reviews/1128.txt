What happened?
Ther overall design and look is awesome.. the case etc. neat. The problem is that you can't put a beverage in the cup, put the lid on it, case it and get where you need to go WITHOUT IT LEAKING.  I have two of these and both leak if the container happens to be tilted sideways.  Sad really as the concept and look are really cool.
