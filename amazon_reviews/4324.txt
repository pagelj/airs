Excellent for the price
I bought these cables to connect my PS3 to my 32" LG HDTV and they definitely provided the higher definition that I was looking for when compared to the AV cable that comes with the PS3.  Don't throw money away buying the more expensive cables when these provide excellent HD transmission.  I highly recommend them for the price.
