Awesome Backpack
My mom first owned this backpack and I just had to have one myself. This backpack is full of different zipped compartments so that you can easily organize a very full backpack. I highly recommend this backpack if you have to haul lots of heavy books while trying to carry all the little office items you might need (pencils, pens...) and 2 areas for storing a water bottle. This is a durable backpack. It takes off some of the stress on your shoulders with the padding within the straps and the back of the backpack that rests against your back has got nice cushy padding while providing some narrow channels (like water streaming) for air to blow through; keeping your back from getting too hot. I love this backpack because it lets me pack a lot of items while organizing them by compartments and providing plenty of padded space for my laptop. This is a good backpack if you want lots of storage space and compartments without having to buy a hiking backpack. This company was also very quick at delivery; I got my backpack way earlier than expected.
