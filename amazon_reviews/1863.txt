I see and Hear the awesomeness!!!!
I purchased these because they didn't have alot of extra cord I didn't need. They work GREAT!!!! I use mine to stream Netfix and Hulu off of my Roku and I must say I am pleased with my purchase. The pictures on my Samsung 42" tv are clear and crisp. We watched Chicken little and you could see every last feather perk, spread and ruffle. The sound from Pandora is awesome. I've eliminated a need for a home stereo. I'm one happy camper.
