HIGHLY Recommended.
I got the Roku 2 as a birthday present. I was already thinking about purchasing an Apple Tv but I'm glad I didn't. Roku 2 is better because it doesn't require you to leave a computer on all day, in order to stream content. Also, you can attach a hard drive to the Roku via a usb port & download the Roku USB Media Player channel (app). This is the highlight of the Roku because you're not limited to the storage space of the Roku or the mini sd card that you can use. There are so many channels (apps) you can use with it that you wont be bored for lack of content. Between Netflix, Crackle, Hulu, Pandora and my own content saved on my portable hard drive, I am already satisfied. There are plenty of channels (apps) that focus on movie & tv content from other countries. There are also private channels that give the Roku 2 a bit more to offer. I use the iTunes Podcasts channel a lot for viewing video podcasts. I would recommend the Roku 2 to anyone looking for a quality streaming device. The customer service staff is really pleasant & helpful too.-Rick
