I've only had this coffee maker for a few days, so I can not speak for it's longevity.  However, if it lasts a year, I'll feel that I got my money's worth.  Firstly, no dripping from the carafe.  None.  Whether it's full or half full, not a drop ends up on the counter.  I bought this to replace my Bunn, which died at 3 1/2 years old.  In comparison, the Bunn had thicker plastic, thicker glass in the carafe, and was of obvious better quality,  which is only fair since it cost five times as much).  Also, while the Bunn makes a pot of cofffee much faster, it did not taste any better tham this Black & Decker.  The upside to having this type of maker is that I'll save a few bucks on my electric bill.  Bunns use a water tank that is continually heating the water, 24 hours a day.  This makes a four to five buck a month difference in your electric bill.  Anyway, one last tip,  no matter the size or brand of cofffee maker you use, the coffee will always taste better if you use bottled distilled or spring water.  Yes, it's a more expensive way of getting a cup of coffee, but the difference in taste is incredible.
