Not for the everyday reader
The book is in its own way very ironic.  It tells the story of a world where the written word is banned and firemen burn books.  The story talks of censorship when the book itself is censored in many countries including in some parts of America.  The story itself comes from the authors own point of view.  He claimed that as he was growing up he saw Hitler burn books and thought it was one of the most criminal acts he had ever scene.  I wouldn't recomend this book to any who do not like to read, but if you are an intellectual reader then this is the book for you.  It brings to life real issues that affect the society today and can open your eyes to things you have never noticed.
