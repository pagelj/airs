touch screen is a pain.
I love many of the features.  It has everything I wanted in a phone, but the touch screen does not work well.  I usually end up flipping open the phone to use it. The camera is pretty good, the screen size is great, the keyboard works well.  I don't go online so that's not a problem.  Also the charger that came with the phone didn't work.  Luckily I had one that I could use.
