I used to pour a cup of coffee at the office in the morning, but ever since I started working from home a few years ago, I never wanted to bother making that morning cup of coffee until now.  Its so easy and even I can do it.  So far so good.  Coffee is a bit more expensive per cut, and once you get over that, its a pleasure.  Still trying different roasts and blends until I can settle on a few regulars to keep on hand. I recommend to all those who are as coffee lazy as I am...
