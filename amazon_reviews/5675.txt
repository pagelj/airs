Excellent Camera
I received this camera as a gift prior to excursion to Peru and Bolivia where I took 1500 pictures and videos.  The camera features were awesome and the HD videos superb.  However, it was the spectacular 50x optical zoom that made the journey.  I was able to dial into parts of ancient sites that I could not walk to nor even see that well with the naked eye.
