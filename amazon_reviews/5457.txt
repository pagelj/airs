compact and sharp
perfect for indoor shots of kids. I have a Tamron 27-50mm that I never felt was quite sharp enough. So I got a Canon 50mm f1.8, but the focus is a little too long on my crop-sensor camera. I always had to back up uncomfortably far to fit everyone in the shot. I think I would like an even shorter focal length, but the prices go up quite a bit as you go wider from 40mm. This is a nice compromise, and works well for documenting family life. I'd recommend it over the 50mm prime. I'm using it with my Canon Rebel T1i.
