I have some kind of old apartment building carpet that clogs my other vacuum, plus a dog who sheds non stop, so I was looking for something that could handle a lot of both, and this one has held up pretty well. I did pick up so much hair that it quickly filled the canister, but it emptied quickly and easily and I was back to vacuuming quickly. The roller brush clogged quickly too but I attribute that to my carpet and the huge amount of dog hair I was trying to pick up. Easy fix though. The pet brush worked really well and quickly on my microfiber couch and everything was easy to put together. I also liked that it was small and lightweight and the price was great. The cord could be longer.
