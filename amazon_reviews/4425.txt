***FIX*** Easy COOL fix when the filter hits the lense glass
I noticed that a few people had problems with the filter bottoming out and hitting the glass on their lenses. I had the same problem when I ordered mine. Luckily there is a quick fix - and it looks cool too! You can use a rubber band as a washer. I used red for mine and now it looks like I have an L series lens - SWEET!  First just screw the filter on the lens very lightly - leaving a gap. Then take a rubber band (a thinner one is better - I got mine from the newspaper that was delivered) and wrap it around the lens filling the small gap. Then you may need to take a set of tweezers just to straighten out the rubber band so it's not twisted. Now straighten the rubber band all the way around the lens. Once that's done tighten down the filter. This worked great for me and it looks awesome too!! - No one would ever know it was a newspaper rubber band!
