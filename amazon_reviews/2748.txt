We bought this coffee maker after our old electric one died and two other ones (Farberware and Melitta 4-cup coffee makers) didn't work out.  We've only used it a few times, but so far it's doing a good job.  Because of previous reviewers' comments about the timer, we decided not to even set/program the clock since turning on the coffee maker in the morning isn't a problem for us.  The only complaint we have so far about this Mr. Coffee is that we haven't been able to find a permanent basket-style filter for it, so we're just using regular ones (the Melitta basket-style filters work perfectly, so don't feel like you have to buy Mr. Coffee brand filters).  Other than that, though, we are satisfied with this coffee maker and will keep it unless something goes wrong.
