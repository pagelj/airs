OXO Good Grips Professional 14-Piece Knife Block Set
Very good set of knives but steak knives are realy cheaply made, they are sharp but there is a considerable lack of quality in comparison with the rest of the knives.  Just look at this set as there were no steak knives at all.  I wanted to make this clear as I see nobody else mentioned it.
