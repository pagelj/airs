Flawed design, poor customer service
Plastic creep over several months distorted the spreader which caused the adjustment screw to damage my cd slot, the email reply from Mountek paid no attention to my problem and only claimed how great their expectations are for the new ngroove design. I'm supposed to believe this company learns lessons from its quality concerns and put down my hard earned again for their latest design (which also uses a spreader)? It will be interesting to see how compatible the "powerful rare earth magnets" used on their latest ngroove design are with sensitive GPS direction finders, example iPhone's magnetometer is susceptible to magnetic interference from electronics and ferrous metals, so theoretically the metal plate you need to attach to the back and the strong magnet in the mount will play havoc with the direction setting capabilities of navigation in iPhone and most likely other phones. Not a risk I'm prepared to take, especially after the fatal design weakness of the support plate on the first mountek, combined with their lack of any interest in my problem.
