I did not like this product at all.  I didn't purchase through Amazon but after researching and reading reviews, I purchased from Walmart.  I was very disappointed.  The vacuum portion of the machine works fine.... but the wet cleaning part is where this machine did not work for me.  The water it puts out covers a very small amount of flooring at a time and the suction did not work well.  I have a large kitchen area with ceramic tile and it would have taken me hours to fully clean.  So after one attempt at using, I packed it up and back to Walmart it went.  Still looking for the right tool for me.
