Best lens for the money, every EOS owner should have one.
5 star for value and picture quality. With the money of 1.4 version, I can have 4 of this, you only lost half stop of aperture. It is cheapest Canon lens yet produce probably the best result. 80mm focal length on Digital Rebel and 10D means it is the best solution for portrait lens. Yeah, plastic lens is not as good as metal one. But I really doubt if it will break any time. for 75 bucks, every EOS owner should have one.
