Upgraded from Optimus V
After having the Optimus V, I was pleasantly surprised with Kyocera's new offering.  It isn't perfect, but it was extremely cheap and gets the job done.  Having a bigger processor helps me run a few more apps and keeps the battery at a decent clip.  I use JuiceDefender to keep the battery lasting longer as well.
