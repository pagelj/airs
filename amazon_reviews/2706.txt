I'm Picky so...  I research long and hard!
I purchased the Samsung LN52A750 LCD, a Samsung BDP-1500 Blue Ray Player, an older 5.1 Dennon Surround sound system with Infinity speakers and I have the Monster HTS 3600 MK11 Power Center. The point is... I'm not afraid to spend the money on quality products if it is necessary. The Mediabridge Ultra High Speed Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3b Category 2 is as good as it gets and at a great low price! HDMI cables are always changing to keep up with technology so there is a difference in cable VERSIONS! The latest Version is the 1.3b Category 2. I originally was set to buy the high end Monster HDMI cables when I began my research... to include men who work in television network video and audio. The unique thing about Monsters high end cables is that they are made with advancements for "future versions " already built in the cable. This means that when new technology is implemented... you are cable ready for the new versions. But it doesn't improve the "present technology" version of 1.3b Category 2. Bottom line... when the new version technology is available... I'll buy the new version from Mediabridge for about $150 dollars less per cable than the Monster cable. That will buy a lot of Mediabridge cables as new versions are implemented! Wouldn't you agree? Buy with confidence from the seller. My Mediabridge cables work fantastic. Thank You for listening!
