A lot better than Feast, but that's not saying much
ADWD "Awards":Most engaging chapters: TyrionMost events: JonMost satisfying story arc: Theon and Asha GreyjoyMost progression: BranMost confused, convoluted, complex: Dany / Quentyn / Selmy / Tyrion / VictarionMost boring: Dany and TyrionPointless: The Watcher & MelisandreUnsatisfying: Everything except the Greyjoys[....]. Reason for my awards / review?  'Cause I'm opposite of impressed w/ ADWD. I was anticipating ASOS-material from the positive early reviews, but besides a couple of Tyrion chapters, I found this book yet another metaphorical chapter to a genre chock-full of bloated epic fantasy storytelling. I was expecting ASOS events, yet I was sadly disappointed by AFFC meanderings. Since this book parallels AFFC in many respects, I suppose it only fitting that the book suffers from similar failures in progress, resolution and satisfaction. I would like to put my official stamp of disapproval on this series which has deteriorated drastically from a stellar third book, A STORM OF SWORDS. In A STORM OF SWORDS, one shocking event after another seemed to move the book at a torrid pace. In A FEAST FOR CROWS and A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, I was hard pressed to find events, much less any movement to the novel. In spite of it all, this book fares better than A FEAST FOR CROWS... a lot better. Sadly, that's not saying much. Unlike its predecessors, even if we were to take AFFC and ADWD together, there exists so few resolutions to any existing plots that the two latest novels cannot possibly stand on their own. Unlike its predecessors, AFFC and ADWD feel like bridge novels; nothing is resolved in a satisfying manner and more questions and plot tangents arise instead. Unlike his first three novels, none of the story arcs in AFFC and ADWD (with the possible exception of the Greyjoy story arc) contained endings unto themselves and yet left the reader wanting more.1.
