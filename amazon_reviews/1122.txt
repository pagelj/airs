Great Accessory for the Atrix 4G
This is a great addition to your Atrix 4G phone, now that the price is down to reasonable level (a third of original, as the 4G is being phased out). If you keep in mind that this is an extension of the intelligence build into the 4G and NOT a laptop replacement, you won't be disappointed.  Note that the on-board intelligence is limited to the Linux interface and Firefox browser (both residing in firmware).  Since there is no user changeable storage on board, only additional applications (or changes) are those made within the phone itself. Phone operations other than calls are a lot more convenient with larger screen and real keyboard (mouse optional).  The interface is sometimes buggy during desktop operations (hesitation, cursor freeze) but easily fixed with reset (close and re-open display).  Unit restores desktop reliably after reset, and also after replacing phone after removal for calls.  The 1GB RAM within phone limits the number of browser sessions or tabs that can be opened at one time. It also appears to have a sizable battery built in.  Battery charge indicator still shows "full" after 2 hour usage.  Phone is kept fully charged while docked.  Unit also doubles as a phone charger as such. This addition should make a great travel companion for those who pack light.
