Great price and great quality
My larger Dell laptop and my little Dell Latitude Notebook both died within weeks of each other.  Mother boards.  Too expensive to fix especially given the age and condition of the computers.  I also have a Mac, but wanted to continue to manage my photos and videos on a pc.  Didn't want to learn new O/S, etc., and this one came with 7 / XP.  Looks like new.  Runs quieter than my old ones.  Great price.  Not sure I will ever buy new again, when refurbished is so good and so inexpensive.
