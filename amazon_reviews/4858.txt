Good Chicklit Dystopia
Divergent is a lot of fun.  It's one of those first-person action adventures and it's smarter than most.  There the idea of a society where people's functions are divided into factions, and that whole concept is well developed. In addition there's great action and the main character is a smart lass who rises to the occasion as she changes factions and goes from one with a focus on service to others, to warfare and defense.  Tris training is dramatic and I won't say more lest I drop some spoilers.. Overall I enjoyed this book, but I have to say that there's a romance at the heart of it, so if that's not something you enjoy, you should move along to the next great read.
