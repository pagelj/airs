Photo OK, Video Not So Good
This remote works well on my Canon T31 for snapping photos, however I haven't been able to get it to work properly for video (which is the primary reason I made the purchase).  During video mode, when the remote button is pressed the camera begins shooting, then automatically stops filming in only a few seconds.  I can't get it to stop stopping! Seeing how the instructions are very simple, I think I've followed them properly. Ok for photography - not working for video.
