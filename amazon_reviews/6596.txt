This cheap little HDMI cable can perform and then some.
Products like this are why I am grateful for the review system here at Amazon.  I decided to give this HDMI cable a try after reading customers' reviews about how this cable is no different than the expensive Monster brand. Later I found a CNET article that confirmed what everyone was saying: [...]The cable came in a few days later sealed in a plain plastic bag. I connected one end to my 46" Samsung A550 LCD, and the other end to my Panasonic 35K Blu-ray player. As simple as that. Then I fired up the Dark Knight. Now, I don't have one of the expensive HDMI cables to compare, but the picture I observed was definitely full 1080p HD. Sound quality was amazing too. I even felt a little guilty I had doubted that such a cheap little cable would perform so well. The reviews I read were right, digital HDMI is an all-or-none signal, regardless of price or brand. I highly recommend buying this HDMI cable if you plan on upgrading to 1080p HD. Don't be fooled by the salespeople at your electronics store and give this little cable a try. At this price, you won't be sorry.
