Great Toaster
This toaster is one my families and I's favorite small appliances. The blue LED lights and controls are great and you can veiw the toast without turning it off.  The number dials are easy to use, even for my kids. They know what settings their toaster pastries or toast needs to be on. I also like the very sleek and modern look and feel, you can't go wrong with this toaster.
