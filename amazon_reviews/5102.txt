the app has compatibility issues
The app would be great if it would open on kindle fire HD products but it doesn't and therefore I can't possibly like it if it says it allows free access to both kindle and kindle fire and kindle fire HD if it absolutely doesn't. Now it could be amazing but my kindle fire HD will never know so I can't really rate it sufficiently without bias in it because of this one reason that has thoroughly been stated and explained. Remember that my report isn't really on the product itself, it's on the products compatibility, and I don't like it's compatibility. It said that the app was compatible and that hasn't been proven
