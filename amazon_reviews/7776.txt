First Smartphone
I love it. I'm not a geek but I have loved setting this phone up and using it. The physical keyboard is hard to use, flat keys. but the touch screen is nice a little light to the touch but you can download pretty much anything to make the phone the way you want it. I charge every night but I downloaded a task manager and it does help, not bad for an Android. Over all I am pleased.
