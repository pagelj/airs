OK for the price.  A bit small. Good quality.
This case is well made, slight neoprene smell.  Has a small fabric pocket of the front with zipper.  A Velcro secured flap, a snap loop for your belt and a steel ring.  It's fine but a bit small.  Only the smallest and thinnest cameras would fit.  Too small for even most cell phones.
