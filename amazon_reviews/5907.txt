Excellent smoothie maker!
I've had this for six months and it is still going strong! It used to have that "hot motor" smell if I pulsed it for too long, but I haven't noticed in the last couple of months. I like to use this for making a powdered protein shake with milk, yogurt, a banana, and a couple of ice cubes or frozen fruit. I've found that if I put in more than maybe four frozen strawberries, it gets too thick and anything at the top won't blend - but that happens with my regular big blender too.  I see that the price has dropped some. I'm tempted to get another one just to have an extra blender cup. (And then if the motor ever quits, I have a back up and still have the two cups.) :)
