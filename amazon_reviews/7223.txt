My wife and I just love this waste basket. We have had it for several months now and it works just perfectly. In the months that we've had it, we have also had numerous house guest and visitors that think it's the "neatest" thing since sliced bread and the computer. As a matter of fact, I have printed out extra copies of the purchase details and have them readily available because everyone that sees it wants to know where we got it and how they can get one.
