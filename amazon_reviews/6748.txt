Great Sharpner, Easy to Use
I have a number of Henckels knives.  Not sure of the 'model' but they're called "Ice Hardened".  Of course, also have other knives.  I think the trick to keeping a sharp edge is sharpening the knife after each use.  The sharpener is kept in a drawer by the knife block and my cutting area.  Just take it out of the drawer, give the knife a few swipes and you're done.  I had a Chef's Choice 120.  Had to get it out of a cabinet, take it out of its box, plug it in and go from there.  Just too inconvenient.  Plus, it enjoyed eating my blades and it cost a heck of a lot more.  It went to Goodwill.
