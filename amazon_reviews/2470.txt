Great case for a good price
This is a decent case that adds minimal bulk to the phone. The white looks great on the black phone and really gives it a standout look. The description mentions that it has a "rubber feel" but it feels more slick then like a true rubber. I like the feel of it but if you're looking for something that offers more grip you may want to look elsewhere. I'd buy this again if I could do it over and recommend it for the price.
