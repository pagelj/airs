I thought the coffee would taste really good.  It is very weak and the cup sizes are not as big as they say they are going to be.  I'm still experimenting and have not tried my own coffee yet in the K cup, but will be doing this soon.  Hoping that the flavor will be better.  I have had cappacino and hot chocolate from my friend's Keurig and it was really good.  I am a little disappointed.
