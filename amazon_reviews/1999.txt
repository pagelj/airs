Great pack, one downfall
I really like the size of this pack, but there is one downfall.  I brought this with me to be my carry-on bag for a long flight and everything was fine in the Portland and Dallas Airports, but in San Francisco, they also didn't let me use it as carry-on.  The problem was the height of the pack.  It was not packed high, but with the metal inserts for internal support, the height was 23" and the maximum height for bags is 22".  This is the only problem I've found so far.  Otherwise, it has been a great pack.
