exceeds expectations
I expected more compromises in this lens since it covers such a wide focal length. I did not expect it to be as sharp as my 70-300 vr, but it appears to be. it does not seem all that heavy. In fact, I find that I have more control over this lensthan the 70-300 VR. The color, contrast, ease of use with this lens are very acceptable. There will be less missed shots with this lens. I feel nikon has hit a home run with this 18-300 VR.
