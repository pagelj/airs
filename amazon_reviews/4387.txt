Olympus Recorder - Changes my (work) Life
I was using a Phillips before which failed because the USB cable was defective.  After receiving the Olympus, I was finally able to determine WHY I was unable to transfer files.  The design of the Olympus is terrific.  Speakers at top that sit outside the soft case. "Hold" feature that prevents the recorder from shutting off (just when you think the recording is taking place).  Good sound quality.  Love this product.
