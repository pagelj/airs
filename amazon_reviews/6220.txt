Much much better than I expected
This is my 2nd waterproof camera - my 1st was an entry-level Olympus which takes good still images but the video was low-rent.  I'm going to one of Mexico's seaside resorts this April and wanted a better waterproof camera.  At the end of my research, it came down to the Sony TX20 and the AW100.  I am a Nikon fan(D90 + V1) as well as Sony's(Nex-5N).  The AW100 has GPS and better ergonomics IMO.  I like external controls whereas on Sony, everything must go through the menu.  I have high regards for both Nikon and Sony, but when it comes to digital camera/photography, my vote goes to Nikon.  On the AW100, IQ is good, video is good and GPS(geo-tagging) is good.  The level of control is good for a P&S but nowhere close to dSLR or high-end mirrorless.  But for its class, the AW100 is just right for me.  Coolest feature - GPS!
