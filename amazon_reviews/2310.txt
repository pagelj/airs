When I first got this vac, my bedroom was a mess, i have been hand sweeping it for 3 years and not keeping up. with 3 dogs. (yikes)After hand sweeping I plugged in the vac and it still filled the cannister half way before i emptied it. I use some anti flea powder on the carpet, no issues with this product and the Vac. I am extremely glad Bissel screwed up and i bought the Hoover, no regrets. prosGreat suction, i havent filled the cannister but i empty it about halfway. Works great on carpet, bare floor or wood. I have had no issues on these surfaces. It was in stock, unlike the Bissel I tried to buy. After seeing the charge pending for a few days I called Bissel and learned my item was out of stock. They wanted me to buy another one lol.  I got my money back, and after talking to my sister, she has had a Hoover awhile, I bought the wind tunneland havent looked back. Powered Handheld that goes on the end of the hose is VERY cool. I was wondering what they meant by "powered" as its not electrical, its air! Very nice attachment. Rewind cord is nice, i like it better than the wrap around provided it holds up, see below. has 4 height levels for the floor vacuum, for those with carpet of different heights, tile and wood this is a nice feature. consGets hot which i think effects the retractable cord; let it cool down a few minutes before rewinding. The vacuum hose itself is retractable, which works well, but I would like another foot of length, or a longer shaft on the attachment itself. I am short for a man @ 5'7Secure the electrical cord when you plug it in, mine fell out of the plug or i didnt plug it in all the way and i thought i broke it the first 5 mins. I think my light quit working, as i dont see it on, or if i even had one, but this does not affect my opinion of the vac. GO HOOVER ! JamesArlington,Tx
