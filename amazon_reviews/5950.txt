20000 leagues under the sea
i read the other reviews by other people, and almost all of them missed the point.  the book did not have many major action points, but it is not a tom clancy novel.  it did teach some about undersea life, but it is not a text book.  jules verne wrote books from his imagination.  this book was published in 1870.  underwater travel was a joke.  it was possible, but most people did not know this.  i read this book when i was 10 or 11, so it has been a while, but i remember being completely ingrigued, myself knowing probably everything jules verne did about undersea travel.  i honestly don't remember much other than the major points of the plot, only that i loved the book, and the extensive explanations only served to deepen the insight and wonder into not only the book, but the mastermind behind it.
