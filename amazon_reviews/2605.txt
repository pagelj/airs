Great card
I have been using it for a while now and have had no problems with transfer speed. I am not a professional so I don't know all the specifics of it but it works great for me. The only problem I have is it doesn't work with my computer because my computer can't handle this size card so I do the transferring through the video camera or my USB to flash card adaptor. My video camera is a Canon VIXIA HFM30
