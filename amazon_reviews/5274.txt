GET THESE CABLES! A+++++++++
don't even think about purchasing those 'high end' $100 Monster cables at Best Buy or Circuit City--- you WILL get ripped off. these HDMI cables are awesome! the clarity of my HDTV is crystal clear.  I am also using these cables on my HD DVD player-- again, the picture is breathtaking. you will not be disappointed if you buy these cables.
