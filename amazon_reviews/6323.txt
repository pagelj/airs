Very solid
This is a very solid mount. With the bolts it came with I was able to bolt it to the wall and hang on it myself (250 pound man) and it did not even budge. I felt very safe putting my 55" plasma on it (aprox 88 pounds). Its not so close to the wall where you cant get to the plugs on the side of your TV and I was able to stuff the power strip and cables behind it fine.
