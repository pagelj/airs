Stable Stylish and Sleek Product
I received this product today and am very pleased with this purchase.  Everything you need is in the box, including the single screw driver you need to assemble it.  I have a 15" macbook pro and it fits perfectly and it is sturdy enough to wheel around the house without fail.  With the cover open you get just enough table top room for a note pad a remote or a mouse.  The stand allows you to completely turn your laptop table top 360 degrees and I love that.  Great product and the quick free shipping made it even a greater value.  Overall this Shaper Image Table Laptop cart is STABLE, STYLISH, & SLEEK.
