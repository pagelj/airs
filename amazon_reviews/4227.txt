Poor customer service
We originally purchased 2 of these monitors with the intent of owning the best video monitor available.  Sadly, after 6 months, the second monitor has encountered the issue of losing complete sound... exactly like the first one.  Frustrating, sure, forgivable, yes given the many other desirable features.  However, the motorola customer service just informed me that they will not send a replacement monitor until my claim has been processed (at least 48 hours) and then ground shipping.  So, it will likely be 5-7 days until I receive a monitor.  Their excuse was something about only having 1 person to process the claims.  Meanwhile, I have a soundless (i. e. useless) monitor which I rely on during the nights with my 8 month old and 2 year old.  Talk about disappointing to a parent.  As an aside, I love Amazon. com and have been a customer for years and this is the first review I have written... clearly out of frustration. UPDATE 6/14:  The good news with the replacement monitor in March was that it came quicker than expected.  Unfortunately, less than 3 months later, we have encountered the same sound issue.... for the third time.  The Motorola representative I spoke with today was very helpful and I'm expecting another replacement soon.
