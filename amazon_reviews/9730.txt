my kindle fire says this is not a fast charger
When I plug this in with the cord that came with my kindle fire,I get a warning message that this is not a fast charger and the unit will not recharge while in use, because it does not deliver enough power to do so. sure enough, after a few days of use and leaving it plugged in at times, my kindle was OUT of power and that never happened before. This is useless. my cell phone charger and other chargers all work better than this one.
