GREAT MONITOR WITH ONE HUGE FLAW!
After much research I was very excited to purchase this monitor.  Unfortunatly after the first day, I had to return it.  It is a great monitor, excellent quality screen, great features, except THE VOLUME CANNOT BE MUTED.  Most reviews failed to mention this and for me, it was a huge deal breaker.  If you are planning to sleep train your child or if you have a fussy sleeper prone to waking up random times through the night crying out or just babbling, the options to not turn the volume off was a huge pain! My child is a poor sleeper so I decided to purchase a video monitor.  I had tried a summer infant monitor and liked that when my child began to cry, I could simply mute the monitor and watch her to ensure she was ok (without waking my husband).  However the quality of the summer infant monitor was poor.  If you want to hear your child at all times and have a quiet and content sleeper I HIGHLY recommend this monitor.  If you have a fussy sleeper like I do who needs to cry it out a bit before falling back asleep.... I'd pass.
