Many advantages over 1st gen Xbox 360
This review will focus on the BEST features that this offers over the older Xbox 360. Size-this is much smaller than the first generation xbox, which makes it a better fit for the smaller entertainment centers that sit bellow HDTVsSound-the new slim Xbox is amazingly quiet.  I can easily forget this one is on, whereas the older xbox sounds like a tornado at times. Speed-while there is not a huge difference in speed, it is visible when cycling through the Xbox DashboardWireless-one of the best features of the slim Xbox is integrated wifi.  I can notice no speed difference between wireless and wired, and it is awesome to be able to do it without having to buy and add-on like on the older xbox. The only negative side of the slim version is that you can not easily use your 1st gen hard drive.  You can disassemble it and place it in a new case, but it is really not worth the trouble. While I do not believe this xbox is worth the jump from the old console for everyone, it would be worth it if you are constantly annoyed by the sound, need one with wireless options, and like the new size and look!
