Overheated
I purchased this adapter (which is rated up to 240 volts) along with a Kindle Touch. It worked fine in the US but I recently traveled to the UK where I attempted to use it with an expensive UK combination adapter/converter and the Kindle adapter overheated (small "pimple" formed on the reverse side of the adapter opposite from label and a burned electrical smell from the adapter). When I purchased this item I felt it should have been included with the Kindle and UBS cord but bought it hoping that because of the price it would be durable and of the highest quality. It doesn't appear that that is the case.
