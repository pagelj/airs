Pretty amazing camera!
This is my first camera from Canon's S-series.  I've never owned or used the S95 or S100; additionally, I'm not a professional.  I do have a Canon SLR crop camera (Rebel XSi witht the 580EXII speedlight and several lenses including some L lenses), which I love and have used for the past several years. I had a 7-day trip to Paris coming up and really didn't want to carry my SLR around.  I also didn't want to miss out on amazing pictures and memories of my first trip to the beatiful city.  I made the decision to go with the S line and originally came here to Amazon to buy the S100.  To my amazement, there was a note that the S110 was just a few days away from being released, and with the groans of the lens error that S100 owners complained about, I chose to try the upgrade. I've go to say that the S110 is pretty amazing. I took over 1800 pictures and 50+ HD movies and was blown away by what this camera can do.  Moreover, its low-light capability is truly amazing... I hardly ever used the flash whenever some light source was in my shot.  The manual settings are great for achieving specific shots. The build quality is great.  There is no viewfinder, but I'm more than happy with the large toughscreen.  Battery life is as expected although not as long as in my SLR (which is expected due to the smaller batter size).  The white body is beautiful and definitely draws attention in a sea of black cameras.  The camera is compact, but obviously no where near the size of those mini Canon elph's. I found the startup to be quite fast.  I was able to pull out this camera while on the move, take a couple of shots and put away the camera, all in a really short duration of time. Let's be clear though.. this doesn't produce SLR quality pics, but for its size and convenience,it's a great option for those traveling light, or those that don't want to invest in a SLR right now. Hope this helps!
