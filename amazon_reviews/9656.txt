Problems with remote
The remote control got a small amount of water on it and apparently it was just enough to roughen the remote so rather than mess with the seller I went right to Sony and explained my situation and they had one sent out immediately for $19.63 and had it before the next weekend and now everything works great again. My warning to everyone is don't get it (remote) wet even with the smallest amount of water because it will burn something out...  Ken S.
