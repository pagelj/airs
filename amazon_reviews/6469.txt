Finally I found a great coffee maker!!!  Love the 4 hours that the heat plate will stay on instead of the 2 hours that most pots are.  The internal water filter is fantastic.  I used to have to filter our water in a pitcher so the water didn't have the chemical flavor.  Another thing is the pour spout.  I've had a lot of pots before, but this one is great.  You can pour a cup of coffee without it dribbling all over the table.
