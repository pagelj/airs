Only Useful in Well Lit Areas.
My boyfriend got me this Camera for my birthday through New Egg and I was super excited about getting a new camera (mine had been stolen last Christmas along with my purse). I took it to my sister's wedding 5 days later and attempted to use the "party/indoor" setting. Every single picture taken came out like it was a 1.5 megapixel camera and the battery died in an hour after being charged all night long. I called Nikon and they basically told me I was an idiot who didn't know how to use a camera. The touch screen started changing settings on it's own and was taking pictures by itself. We wrote to New Egg and they replaced the camera with a new one a week later. The new camera has worked great, when used outside on an outside setting in a well lit area. The battery has lasted weeks at a time in between charges. I recently took this camera to his cousin's wedding where I attempted to use the "party/indoor" setting again. The pictures came out blurry, awful and they look like a 1.5 megapixel setting. I don't blame my boyfriend for his choice, after all he doesn't just buy electronics, he researches them long before he decides to purchase. I feel bad when he's sitting right there and I start having difficulties with this camera as he bought it for me. I had told my boyfriend not to get me a Kodak (even though I love Kodak) because I had read they would be going out of business or filing for bankruptcy. I didn't want an Olympus and I was going back and forth between Cannon and Nikon. I should've just asked for a new Kodak. Needless to say, I thought Nikon was supposed to be a good brand, guess it only qualifies when you get the $1500 camera as opposed to the $300 camera.
