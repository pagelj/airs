Incomplete
This package arrived with out the small black ink cartridge and without it the printer will not work althoughthe large black ink cartridge was installed.  Did not know that the large cartridge was included instead of the small one.  It is a big error on Canon's part just so they could have a more competitive price on the package but myprinter just will not work without all five (5) cartridges installed.  So now must place another order and wait toprint bulletins for church which were not done last Sunday, and now maybe not this coming Sunday.
