Happy with my decision
I debated between the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS20 and the Olympus TG-310.  I used my friend's Olympus TG-310 on a trip and found I didn't feel like I could get a good picture even with switching settings and making adjustments.  I did not want a camera that I had to constantly adjust because I knew that I would miss a lot of good photo opps while making adjustments.  I read a lot of reviews and decided to go with the Panasonic.  So far I am happy with my decision.  I used it on a weekend trip the first weekend I got it and found it took good underwater pics as well as indoor and outdoor pics.  I am a realist and understand that I am not going to get the same quality pics that I get from a DSLR camera.  As long as you consider that and take some time to familiarize yourself with it, I think anyone would be happy with the pictures this camera takes.  It fits in my pocket which I also love versus my current bulky camera.  I am also excited to use this camera on a trip to Florida next week where I plan to use it at Discovery Cove as well as all the other parks.  On our last trip there it rained quite a bit and I didn't get pics of some things I wanted to.  Looking forward to that not being an issue on this trip!!  Battery life was decent.  I bought an extra battery and SD card so that I wouldn't have an issue with letting it dry after using it in water..... something to think about if you are looking to buy this camera.  Overall I am pleased with my purchase!
