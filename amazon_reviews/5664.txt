very nice shade of purple indeed! not a huge fan of the keyboard cover though!
I do have trouble keeping finger prints off of the case but other then that its very good! heads up! the rubbery material of the keyboard kind off lowers the speaker capacity: i other words when i take of the keyboard cover i hear the music better,clearer. other than that the color is just as shown on the picture, very nice shade of purple!!!!
