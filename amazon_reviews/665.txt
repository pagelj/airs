Looks can be deceiving
It may look like the right charger for the iphone but it doesn't charge like it. Ran my battery down to 3% at night. Plugged it into this "new iphone charger" before I went to bed. At 8am the next day, my battery was 35% charged. I'm no expert but it shouldn't take that long to charge 35%. Plugged it into my original charger and it fully charged in 2+ hours. Bought it because I wanted the cigarette lighter charger but I'm thinking twice now. You get what you pay for I guess. Can't return it cuz I threw all the wapping & paperwork out.
