Didn't stick at all.
This mount doesn't stick out very far, which wouldn't have been a problem if it had actually stuck. I got it because other reviews claimed it was extremely sticky even on their textured dashes, but that wasn't not the case for me. Wouldn't even stick to my window. Returned immediately. EDIT:  CSR read my review, send me an email to solve the problem and a replacement mount at no cost to me. The second mount does stick, but it's still a little awkward since the arm doesn't stick out far enough for my liking. It does work, though, and I was pleased with the unexpected response and effort to solve the problem.
