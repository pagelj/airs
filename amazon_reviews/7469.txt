Simply Stunning.
I got this phone earlier this week and I'm extremely happy with it. It is a very high quality device. My favorite feature is the brilliant screen. It makes reading on the phone a great experience and I feel like the phone is the perfect size. It is surprisingly thin and light. Some complain about the plastic backing, but it makes the phone significantly more durable. If you still need protection, I highly recommend this case: SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Protective [Slim Armor] [Infinity White] Dual Layer Advanced Shock Absoption Protective Case for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 - Infinity White with the SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil [Ultra Crystal] Premium Crystal Clear High Definition Front Screen Protector for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 . I'm sure many other reviewers have touched on the strengths of the phone so I'll leave a few notable tips on things I've learned:- Google Play MUSIC app consumes a TON of battery if left running in the background- "Adapt" sound can enhance audio for your ears after being set up- If you swipe high up on the lock screen with lock screen widgets enabled you can have multiple lock screens- The keyboard is not as good as the swiftkey app (available in play store)Overall the phone is outstanding. More to come as I gain more experience with the device.
