Better than expected
Unlike other orders I have received in the past, I was not excited when this was delivered to me. This was because of all the negative reviews I read after clicking 'place order'. However, this was much better than I would have ever thought. The delivery was very, very prompt (I have prime). And the packaging quality was superb. It comes in a tiny box surrounded by air cushion bags- and all of that in another box. Quality of the tubes was another surprise. Full metal construction, no scratches, and simply good overall. I took some good macro shots with this and here's what I think: Very good taste of macro photography. It's not a replacement by no means because you lose aperture control, auto focus, and the thing feels like the lens is going to fall out. Speaking about fall out, the metal screw is a bit confusing. I think I figured it out but I'm not 100% sure I am using the product the right way.  A few instructions would be nice but it's fine; a little practice and I'm sure anyone can do it(Ok,maybe not everyone). Also, you're going to need a LOT more light for the same exposure for pictures without the tubes. I personally didn't need a tripod and still managed to capture a few insects. Basically, for around 12 dollars - the price of a meal at a fastfood joint- you can start and experiment macro photography and just simply play around. Great deal for some big fun.
