Item and its instructions
Up to now, the DVD player works very well. My only - but important - reserve goes to its instructions, which are incomplete in some points. I purchased this player in order to use it with DVDs of different regions and perhaps with different voltages. On Amazon website it was clearly specified that the player was multi-regional and worked with 100-240 v. On the contrary, the instructions joined to the item said nothing about these two points. Finally I made an experiment and made sure that the player can play DVDs of different regions, but it is not so easy to check immediately its multi-voltage function, so in this respect I am still uncertain of its quality.
