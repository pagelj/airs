Great read.
I'm horrible at writing book reviews so i will try to keep this as short and to the point as possible. I really wasn't expecting alot with this book, A lot of writers have been jumping on the post apocalyptic band wagon lately, but i thought the idea sounded neat so i gave it go. I'm really glad i did, because i love the hell out of this book. I really enjoyed Walt's character, i thought his transition from every day man to survivor of a plague, was what i would imagine to be quite realistic (Having never been through a plague myself i don't really know how realisitc, but i imagine a bit like the book.)Some post apocalyptic reads don't really make you feel for the character, sometimes you can feel lost in all that is going on and all the chaos and the characters can feel a little abstract. But i really felt for the characters and i didn't get lost in all the chaos of what was going on, i was still aware of how the character felt and what was going on with them. I also feel that in breakers there wasn't a lot of unnecessary "Oh the horror" moments, you know that cliche stuff? I felt like everything really fit with the story and had a point while still telling me a horrible plague was going on and people were dying puking blood and society had fallen. Any way, My suggestion is that you give it a try. I loved it.
