Great customer service and fast shipping!
This screen protector was very difficult to apply and, in fact, I was not happy with my first attempt. I basically ruined it and had to trash it. The liquid solution makes it hard to work with and the size of the SmartWatch screen is so small that, unless you have tiny fingers, getting it on straight without finger prints and/or bubbles is frustrating to say the least! If I were to base my review on the product (and application process) alone, I would probably only give it one or two stars. But the Skinomi folks were nice enough to send me a second kit free of charge so that I could give it a second try! To be completely fair, the small size of the SmartWatch screen is certainly not Skinomi's fault, so based on their great customer service and fast delivery, I'm giving them a 4-star review. The application of this product obviously takes a little practice to get it right, so one thing I would recommend is to get a kit with several screen protectors included as opposed to buying just a single one like I did. Again, kudos to Skinomi for their excellent customer service, great communication and lightning fast shipping!
