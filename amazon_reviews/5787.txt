Changed the way I shoot
Being fairly new to the DSLR world, I'm constantly learning how to get the best out of my D50. This flash has been the most important piece to the puzzle to get the results I want. I was very frustrated when I always got the washed out look when shooting indoor photos of my newborn son. Once I learned about flash bounce and purchased the SB-4oo, I really started to get the results I was looking for. The skin tones are much more natural and it really illuminates the background and provides great fill light. Excellent purchase, a must if shooting indoor shots.
