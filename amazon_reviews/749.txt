I did a lot of homework before buying this little beaut and its all I wanted and then some. I purchased it at another store so I could go in a see the display and easily return it if I did not like it. I have owned and enjoyed it for about 2 years now. It still runs well and I wanted to wait a while before posting my review to see what the vacuum can do and how it holds up. PROS:I really like the light weight and its handling. It cleans the carpets very well and picks up all the pet hair from my dog and 2 cats, the carpets look good for several days after I vacuum and the bag-less canister shows all the  the grime and yuck it pulls upThe retractable cord is pretty neat. I thought it was a little over the top at first few times I used it but I have come to appreciate the convince factor. The top folds down and makes it easy to store in a small space or closet. Bare floor button option is handy. CONS:It can not pivot turn like a DysonThe motor is not very quiet. Use caution around loose carpet threads or twine like materials the vacuum brushes are efficient and will suck up strings and things that will get wrapped around the brushes. The canister hinges for the top are not very durable.  Hoover should have thought that through better. I accidentally shook the whole can too hard over the trash and the top twisted off in my hand and the rest of the can hit the ground and when I checked it out one of the plastic hinges got broken off. The extendable soft hose for attachments  The price point is good and being $400 less than the Dyson Animal and that make it a greats purchase.
