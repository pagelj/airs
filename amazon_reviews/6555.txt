Very good product
Would have given it 5 stars but the plastic screen seems to be a bit hazy in bright sunlight. Not sure if they are supposed to be clearer or not. Still thoroughly impressed though. Easy application and comes with cleaning cloth. It for sure is anti-glare and things of that nature.
