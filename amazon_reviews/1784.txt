Krups Toaster, Cabinet Slayer!!!
This toaster seemed innocuous enough and was a gift from my mother-in-law. I removed the shiny toaster from it's packaging and placed it gently on the kitchen counter. I read the manual, because I am like that. The manual said to run the toaster on it's highest setting several times in a well ventilated area to remove dust from manufacturing. It should have said on a deserted island far far from any living soul. The first run, all went as expected, it stank to high heaven as it burned off who knows what and the noxious fumes filled the air. Then my husband set it for a second run, reading that the area should be well ventilated he pulled the toaster halfway out from underneath the cabinet to allow for greater airflow. Shortly thereafter I returned to see the incredible intense solar flare like heat had burned and melted and distorted the face of my kitchen cabinet! Why the toaster had mutilated my cabinet with such vengeance, I can only speculate. However I will be returning this viscous toaster before it can commit 3rd degree burns on my children, my husband, my self and anyone else who dares to enter its general vicinity. To be fair, I have never used this toaster to toast bread.
