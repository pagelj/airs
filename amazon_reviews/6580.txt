Ok for small things
It records well and has ok sound quality. However, if you want a product that you can use and then store files on your computer this is not the recorder for you. What I mean is, if you're in college like me and want to record and save lectures, then find a different recorder. But like I said, if you only need it for interviews that you can later delete or for small things, then this is a very nice recorder.
