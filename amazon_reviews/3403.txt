Don't believe the hype
This Wusthof set does not compare to my KitchenAid set I purchased years ago. While using the largest knife tonight, I had to saw through a head of cabbage. I also don't like the way the smaller knives don't seem to fit in the butcher block very well... it's like they're an afterthought. Overall I'd have to say I was disappointed and for a little bit more money, you can upgrade to a much nicer set of knives. Maybe the word "studio" should have alerted me to the entry-level, basic quality of this knife set.
