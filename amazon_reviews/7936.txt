Just getting started
I am getting back into Photography and decided to go with the Canon EOS 60D. This camera is excellent. Starting out in fully programmed mode, it takes great pictures with no effort at all. Starting to experiment with Aperture Priority and Manual mode is more challenging because the range of options can be a bit overwhelming. I am looking forward to learning how to handle all of the options that tis camera offers and I am sure it will do everything that I want.
