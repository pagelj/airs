Couldn't put it down...
This a good book that doesn't get too much into the "50 Shades..." moments that the Hunger Games does with it's teen age girl romance bit... even though it's written with the same view point. That's the only reference that I'll make to the "... Games" series, even though, there are plenty to be made. It does make you stop and question if the decisions we are making now are going to propell us into a future world like the divergent landscape of seperate cultures based on their basic human tendancies. I can' wait for the final book to come out!
