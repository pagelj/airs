I recently purchased the Hoover Tempo and just love it.  I have been using bagless vacs the past few years and finally got tired of the dusty dirty clean up after vacuuming. I mean why should I spend another half hour cleaning and washing my vacuum cleaner.  I finally decided to try a bagged vac again after reading all the great reviews about the Tempo. Well let me tell you it's great!  You can't get a better vacuum cleaner for the price. It doesn't have a bunch of bells and whistles, it just sucks like crazy and it's light. The biggest problem I use to have with bagged vacs was that they would stink after awhile. Well the bagless will do the same.  The trick I have found is to change the bag after each use.  Don't let it sit around in the vacuum cleaner. If you vacumm once a week like I do and you have pets you will probably fill the bag up.  And a bag is a lot easier to clean up than dumping out a canister of loose hair, dust and dirt.  Now I have clean air and a clean house for about $1 a week for the bags. Can't beat that. The filters are also washable.  You don't have to spend twenty something dollars for a new Hepa filter in 6 months, which I think are highly oved rated anyway. I would recommend this vacuum to everyone. Give it a try, it won't break your bank account.
