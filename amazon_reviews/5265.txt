Does What it Should, with Easy Installation to Boot
This review is for the Tech Armour screen protector for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  Installation/application would have been very easy but for my having to install it on a white phone.  For some reason the white "background" of the phone gave me a hard time seeing exactly where I was positioning the leading edge of the protector as I began installation.  Otherwise, I found installation as easy as any other protector I've used. This protector is clear and thin, unlike some of the rubber textured, anti-glare protectors I've used in the past.  I have seen no issues with blurring of items on the screen beneath. In sum, good protector, good company.  Highly recommended.
