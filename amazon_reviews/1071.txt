Keeps you at ease
Having this is great... you know what the baby is doing, rather than guessing what they are doing with the other audio-only monitors. This one is great, with a built in sound machine and night vision abilities. We also like you can set it to a mode that leaves the sound and picture OFF unless the baby stirs and creates enough noise to turn it on. It does what it says. A few things that dropped it 1 star are: WiFi netbook and phones are affected while it's on and near the devices. The range is limited, but I dont think many people want to be so far away from their baby that this is an issue. I read a lot of these devices interfere with wifi and have limited range, so I dont think it's any different. I'd recommend to anyone!
