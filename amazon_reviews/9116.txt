Fixed my frustration
Apparently I'm a power user of my Epic Touch 4G (Galaxy S II) as I typically burn through a battery by 3pm. Well, after 16 months of using two charges a day several times a week, my phone was starting to have power problems. The meter would read about 40% and my phone would shut itself off. Upon reboot, it would show 1% battery remaining. Charge memory on the battery? No telling. But I ordered this battery and, for the last month, it has provided me hours and hours of joy every day. Has all of the OEM markings of the battery originally packaged with my phone and works exactly as the original -- when it was new. Now I'm back to using up my phone with no problems.
