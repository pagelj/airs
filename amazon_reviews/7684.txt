In an effort to keep this short, I'll just say that this machine does what is expected and looks good doing it. It will brew a well-bodied (or light if that's your preference) cup of coffee in 90 seconds. It is fantastic because gone are the days of apportioning coffee into a huge filter, buying those filters, changing them, cleaning out parts, etc... Just fill your mug with water, put that amount in reservoir, and place your mug on the brewing tray. Then take any of the two equally-sized stainless steel filters, fill as desired (there are lines to tell you half a cup or full cup), place on top and bring down the suction-based brew mechanism. Press Regular or Bold and wait 90 seconds. A cup of coffee, which used to be dependent on an entire pot of coffee being brewed, now only needs 2 minutes from nothing to fully brewed, with the filter cleaned and emptied; awaiting another one of your cravings for coffee.
