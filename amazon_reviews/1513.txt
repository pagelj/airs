Too Much Marketing Info
Hello, I just sent in my first Kindle Fire for a refund so I could get the faster new version.  The new version improved processing over the first versionn but the main screen/home now shows contantly "Customers Also Bought" with a listing of their purchases.  I paid the additional $15 to eliminate the subscriptions/coupons but you can not get rid of the list of items other people have bought. The first generation was a nice reading/application/entertainment tablet, but now the emphasis is on sale, sale, sale, sale and that is for me unacceptable.  I'm told that all of the new tablets also have this focus.  I think Amazon did not produce a customer oriented product but one that would support their sales.  I'm going to wait to see what other vendors do with the smaller tablet.
