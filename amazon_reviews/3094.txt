Absolutely worth the price
I have never purchased this type of backpack before and was worried about all the choices. This is the perfect backpacking bag for the price. Extremely easy to carry, plenty of room, and quality made. The zippers are not as easy to zip as I would like but that is a minor detail I can over look for a $50 backpack.
