Tech Support
I just bought a Foscam FI8910W and ran into a technical problem not online or in the quick start guide, so I called tech support.  Tim picked up and had my camera up and running on the local and wireless networks pretty quickly.  I was glad that tech support used remote assistance software, "Team Viewer", so I could watch the troubleshooting steps.  Although, I did hesitate to let a remote user having access to my computer, but I guess the benefit of cool technology was worth the risk.  I think Tim could have been a little more vocal during the troubleshooting, but customer service at most companies has been trained to only provide solutions, not talk customers through the process, so I can't blame him.  I guess providing solutions is good for a significant number of customers, but I feel like I am pretty technical and like to be involved in troubleshooting.  On second thought, it is nice for a change to have someone else do the troubleshooting for me.  Otherwise, he was friendly and extremely professional, and I expect the rest of tech support would be trained in all the same manners I described above.  Overall, a likable experience.
