loud hum!
I ordered this monitor because of the good price and the good reviews (and maybe the pretty blue color) :) When it came, I immediately noticed how cheap the device felt. In the picture, it looks like it will power swivel (like my Summer monitor), but it's a manual swivel. That's no good for viewing the whole room when you're trying not to disturb the baby! But the worst part was this hum that the handset makes if the volume is turned down. Since I keep my handset next to my bed, that would be incredibly annoying. Oh and you can't click the video off. It has to go off on its own. I sent the monitor back and will likely order another Summer Infant monitor. They don't have any of these issues.
