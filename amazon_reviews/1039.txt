It really is fantastic
This is an awesome camera. The features are terrific and I just love how the camera handles. I've been using a New 32gb Micro Sd Card Sdhc Tf Flash Memory Card 32gb Class 10, New! Usa!, and it work wonders. It really helps the camera as it not only has great features, but it can store a ton of pics. I recommend getting this if you are looking for a great camera.
