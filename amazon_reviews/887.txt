OK, first off this is a bare-bones DVD player. You get the player and nothing else. That is fine. The product is fine. I swapped my son's DVD player and this works. It works as well as any of 100's of other companies DVD players worked. The Problem I have is that after I bought it, I was asked to rate it by Amazon and then was sent a letter by the company BEGGING ME to give them a 5 star rating. I am writing this review to tell these people that when we buy their stuff that does not give them a license to use our email to pitch their company for an Amazon rating, and that there are people who are getting 1000's of junk emails a month and do not want to turn what should have been a basic transaction into an annoyance - of any length - for the purchaser. If this company does their job they will not have to send out email begging for 5 stars. It is horrible business practice and frustrating. Stay away from this vendor unless you want to encourage this practice from every vendor. Their original email follows:Hello Armand S Morton,We are contacting you to ensure that your expectations were met for your order with AmaMax on Amazon.
