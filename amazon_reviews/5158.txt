Should have auto flash on button.
First of all, I was impressed with this thing. Considering the price and its so handy. A lots of features. Secondly, after setting up. I noticed that I can't find on how to turn on the flash. I almost loose my patience just to look for the auto flash on. lastly, I'm asking help on how to automatically turn on the flash aside from the flash button release. It should be in menu but I can't find it.1 stars for this thing. I will return this to amazon.
