Prodcuct works really great but mounting was a challenge
Love the item, but I thought it mounted on the refrigerator and was magnetic on both sides. Unfortunately, no directions were included as to how to put the screws in. It was very interesting to figure out how the mounting works. I found out the end caps slip in, so the screws are hidden. You must carefully set the screws into the wood exactly right. One end cap supports the weight of this product, not both ends. The other end just holds it in place. The way it is mounted holds the item just fine; it was just trying to figure out how to do it that was the challenge.
