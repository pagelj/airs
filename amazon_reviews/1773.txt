Long lasting.
I bought these batteries and charger mainly to use them for my toddler son's LeapFrog tablet. Regular batteries did not last long at all. So far I charged them once and we use them for about 2 weeks of everyday tablet use. The charger works great too, before i knew the batteries were ready to go. Great investment.
