Cannot tell that it is refurbished.  This thing is great for quick clean ups in the kitchen and other high traffic areas.  I don't use it very much on carpet, but it does a great job on hard floors and rugs.  I have vacuumed two or three rooms at once and have not yet run out of battery during use.
