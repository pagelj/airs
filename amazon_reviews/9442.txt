DON'T BUY!
I wish I'd thoroughly read all of the other reviews, I would have saved myself the two bucks. What good is a camera if you can't see what you're taking a picture of? A camera is one of the few things I'd use this tablet for, other than reading Kindle books or watching a movie. Waste of money, to only be able to take a picture of yourself or do video chat, which I don't.
