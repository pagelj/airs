I received the Infant Optics monitor last week and so far it's been working well. It performs as advertised. There is no interference to our wifi network and the video in the dark is excellent. We accidentally switched off the night vision (this will happen if you press the + sign on the two sides at the same time) and we thought our unit was defective, until customer service told us how to fix this silly problem. There's no pan and zoom function and I didn't expect a $100 monitor have it... although it would have been wonderful if we could remotely move our camera around. But just like most careful shoppers, I would rather get a two-camera setup on this rather than a pan/zoom monitor at the same price.
