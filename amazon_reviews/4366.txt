Fail, waiting for a replacement.
I hate that I have to experience this. The card failed after about a month of use on my Samsung Galaxy S3. I lost so many memorable pictures & video. I tried on my wife's SGS3 & laptop and still didn't recognize. I bought a card and it fail me, so 1 star for the product. Note:- Amazon policy for only 30 days. So you can't return it to Amazon to get a full refund or replacement.- Contact SanDisk and they will replace your card, just be patient when contacting them through live chat. I got transferred for 2 times.- SanDisk will give you prepaid shipping label.- I'm waiting for my replacement card.- With this experience I'm kind of hesitate to put important files on the card. Just be careful.- Back up your files often within the first 3 months, my two cents.
