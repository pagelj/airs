Bad deal
When i got this touch screen I was very happy until I discovered it didn't have the bluetooth so I had to order a second touch screen the AVH - X 3500BHS which had all the stuff on it plus some extras so me happy now. Oh I just put the other one on eBay to sell it would be easier this way just didn't want to go through the hassle with Amazon. Thanks
