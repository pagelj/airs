Anyone that it doesn't snap in for is a dope like me
If it doesn't snap you probably forgot to take the little rubber protectors off the end of the cable... like I did for about a minute.  Once removed it snaps in perfectly. The cable is high quality, long, and very flexible and has nicely constructed connectors.  And it is about 1/4 the cost of radio sxxxx and bsst buy, both being rip-off artists on items like cables. Its things like this that will make me a prime return customer.  Who can't wait 2 days to save big bucks??
