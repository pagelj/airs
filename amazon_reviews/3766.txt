Decent for the money
These are nice quality headphones but the sound is nothing extraordinary. I was seeking some better than the free ones I got with my Samsung phone. These are not. Good clear sound, just not alot of bass. they are good standard headphones but will not be my primary use ones, I will continue to seek out a good pair that are not rediculously overpriced due to being a brand name.
