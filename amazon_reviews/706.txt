Works great!
I got this because the "Happiest Baby on the Block" method, which includes using white noise, has worked very well with our son.  I wanted something that was easy to turn on and off that could be kept by the crib.  He loves his sleep sheep!  He has even figured out how to turn the sounds on himself.  It has 2 timer settings and four sounds.  It is also very soft.  I would definitely recommend it.
