Sweet book
This was a sweet book, but slow in places. Aaron's wife Hailey died, and in order for him to keep her trust fund going, Aaron had to live and work on her family ranch for 8 weeks a year. His brother in law Jake did not like Aaron, and blamed him for the death of his sister. There was a lot of emotions going on, and stand off's at times. Natalie was born and raised on the ranch. She was now a single mom, working on the ranch. Jack was protective of her. He told Aaron to stay away from Natalie. The chemistry drew Natalie and Aaron together. Natalie tried to stay away from Aaron to protect her job. A lot can happen in 8 weeks, and sometimes it's easier to give into a attraction than it is to fight against it. All in all good book. The price was free, so even better!
