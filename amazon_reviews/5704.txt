Awesome replacement
I was a little concerned with trusting this x-grip at first with my new Iphone 5 but it handles just fine.  It holds the phone right where I want it and it holds tight enough that when I hit a bump the x-grip will not let go.  It is also very easy to remove the phone from the grips of this universal holder.
