Works Again
I purchased WR-111a to use in case of emergencies such as power outages or bad weather. I tested it right out of the box and it seemed to work as advertised. My area was hit pretty bad by hurricane Sandy and I was without power for four days (just got power back). I used the WR-111a to try to get news and information when I needed it most... after approximately 30 mins the unit went dead and left me in the dark, literally. It charges but no light, radio or power. Very disappointed. UPDATE: Reset the unit as advised by the manufacturer and works again.  Thank you Ed!
