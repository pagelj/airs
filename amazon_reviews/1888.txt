Works great!
I took my time looking for a wall mount because the idea of suspending my $1200 tv at a considerable height was not something to be taken lightly.  I was a little skeptical of this mount because it was so cheap ($25 compared to the $80 at Best Buy).  The mount works great though!  It was easy to install, and I mean very simple.  It took us about an hour to mount, drill the holes for the cords, and attach the plates for the holes in the walls.  It looks great though.  I recommend purchasing the Datacomm 50-3332-WH-KIT Flat Panel TV Cable Organizer Kit, as well, if you are running the cables through your wall. The only con in the whole process is that the tv is not easy to tilt.  The wingnuts are difficult to reach when the tv is mounted, so you can't tighten them very well.  It's best to set the mount to the angle you want, before mounting the tv.
