A cute film
I enjoyed this film for several reasons but was pleasantly surprised to see the great footage of Venice at the end.  We were just there 3 months ago so it was an pleasure to see the places we visited.  My husband hasn't watched it yet but I'm going to place a bet with him to see if he can figure out who the little girl is.  We have several films of Diane Lane.  I don't think he will realize it is  the same person.
