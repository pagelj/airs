Failed to Work After Five Days
After reading the reviews, I hoped this monitor would work out for us and it did, for about five days. The unit is clearly cheaply made, but it seemed appropriate for the price. After five days of normal use and no drops, damage, bumps, or other issues, the camera stopped working. The monitor would pick up sound, but no picture. It is going back. I'll have to find a more reliable monitor. I suppose you do get what you pay for!
