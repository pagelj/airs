Great solution for playing avi file on the fire
I have tried many different apps and none of them would play my avid files and most cost more than this. Bait so tar has played everything I have tried. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that there is significant degradation of the picture quality however they stay synced very well and play smoothly. A great app for my uses and the only one I have found that does the job on the fire.
