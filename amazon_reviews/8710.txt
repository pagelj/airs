doesn't get better for the price
Had the camera for a little over a month, very easy to use, long battery life, amazing zoom capabilities, and captures clear videos(good sound also). There are a few features on the camera that is good for adding that unique creative feel (miniature mode). picture quality is very good, almost to a dslr quality.... All in all a great camera to fill in that gap between a point and shoot camera and dslr. You can't get a better camera for this price!
