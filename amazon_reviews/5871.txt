Yup, that's a cable alright.
Bought 4 of these little suckers. And what else can I say.... they work like just like they were intended. And more importantly, still working months later. What is more alarming, is the ridiculous prices that places like Best Buy charge for these. 60 dollars.... really.... serious? I saw people post the phrase "naive citizen tax" and I have to admit, that is dead on. If there is a lack of quality in these cables, then I can't really tell the difference. There is probably some "quality snob" who will argue that I am loosing .0000000001% of picture quality not going with the leading brand, but I'm not willing to spend a $55 difference.
