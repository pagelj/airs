My new favorite book
Ready Player One has just made it to the very top of the list of my favorite books! It is quite easily the most entertaining book I've ever read. Now, some people may claim that it doesn't have as much intellectual merit as other books but that doesn't matter one bit to me. I've read many great novels of all genres and have never picked one up that was more fun to read than this. The story felt like nerd porn. It practically oozed 80s nostalgia and had enough nerd culture references to make me squeal with excitement. Honestly, if you have even the slightest interest in nerd culture, video games, or even just a sense of adventure, you won't regret reading this at all.
