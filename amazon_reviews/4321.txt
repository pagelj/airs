32 GB from Amazon
First Transcend SD card I had to go stupid. I ordered this last week from Amazon and when I recieved it, the card wasn't even in the shipped envelope. Just the advertisements and warranty. I finally recieved it two days ago and when I put it in my Sony a99 it did fine. Until I used it again and the card was corrupted. My PC, Mac, or a99 could not format it. So, it was probably a bad card but I returned it and bought a Sony 32gb sd card.
