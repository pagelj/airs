Great Quality Flatware
Received the flatware and absolutely love it. It matches a previous set purchased from Walmart in everyway, but one... it's obvious the set at Walmart (even thought marketed as the same product) is not the same type or weight of metal. Just keep in mind buying Oneida from different outlets might yield in different styles of end products.
