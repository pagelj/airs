Fabulous story, suspenseful, great twists
The story pulled me in immediately and held my rapt attention to the end. I stayed up late several nights reading it. It's a wonderful mix of characters, technology, action, suspense, and romance. The story includes some tremendous twists, too. About two thirds of the way through, I thought I knew where the story was going to end up, but the ending totally blew me away. I'd love to see this book as a movie. Fans of The Matrix really should enjoy it. The only negative aspect is the lack of editing. The story shines through the typos, though. Great job, Mr. Kitson!
