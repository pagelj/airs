Great Laptop
I was little bit surprised that a laptop at this price can be this good. Very, very sleek and sturdy construction. Nice looking piece of hardware. The I3 is plenty fast enough if you are not a gamer. A great daily laptop. I particularly bought it for travel due its size. After reading others great reviews and a promo code from another seller I made the purchase. Windows 8 takes a little adjustment but it does have desktop mode. I also placed a GODMODE file on the desktop solving the problem of no start menu. Windows 8 can beak tweaked quite a bit but the settings are all over the place. Google GODMODE file for windows 8 for directions. This will put all your settings in that file on your desktop, makes it a breeze to tweak. I highly recommend this piece of hardware.
