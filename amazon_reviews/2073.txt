LR4, A conversatioin with Scott Kelby
"Lightroom 4 book for digital photographers" is a must for those new to Lightroom. If you are familiar with Scott's video style of relaxed casual conversations you won't be surprised by the book's easy to read entertaining conversational writing. I have attempted to go through other LR books and that process is similar to eating glass (Ugh!). LR is a different organizational concept from Photoshop and other digital editing software. Once you tell the "technical geek" that dwells inside many of us to sit down and be quiet then it is easier to relax and grasp the LR organizational concepts as being OK. Scott's workflow approach to chapters makes this possible. I am not into video so skipping over that chapter did not create any loss of knowledge at this time. However, it is there for review later when I am ready to take on video. As a result of this experience I will buy more of Scott's books in the future.
