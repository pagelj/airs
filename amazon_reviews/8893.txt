A nessesity!
It's only a dollar! This stick on cover is amazing.  It's anti everything except for responsiveness! I was always afraid to scratch the screen or get it dirty, that's out the window now.  A quick wipe with a wet tissue cleans it off. The air bubbles took a minute to work out, but who cares.  Honestly, Apple should buy the rights and have iPhones have this pre-stuck on.  It only adds a layer and you can use every case out there on top of it. This is a great investment, it acts as a semi-waterproofing too!
