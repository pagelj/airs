Works with Raspberry Pi
This works well for Raspberry Pi using the Raspbian linux operating system.  Out of box the text and icons are too small and fuzzy.  To increase display text and icon sizes you can edit the folder /boot/config. txt.  Change the lines  #framebuffer_width=1280  #framebuffer_height=720for example to  framebuffer_width=480  framebuffer height=300Don't forget to delete the # at the start of each line. The resolution of the screen is supposed to be 480x240 but putting 240 as the frame buffer height produces a letterbox display.  When you open a window on the screen, it will likely be much wider than the display.  I haven;t  To cure this problem, drag the window to the left to expose the upper right corner of the window and then shrink the window so that is fully within the display.  Then click on the square full display button.  The window will then expand to fit the display.
