Not quite a toaster oven, more like a toast oven
Let me explain the title.  This unit is very small.  Just about all you can fit into it is toast.  Perhaps that is a slight exageration, but it maxes out at 4 pieces of toast or the equivalent thereof.  The various settings are prelabeled for hashbrowns, frozen waffles, rolls and pizza and this is where I have an issue.  There is no false advertising since it says it fits a 9" pizza.  The only problem is, most standard frozen pizza's are 10-11" so unless they are single serving size, you won't be toasting pizza's for the kids. Overall, it is a very light and compact unit for space conscious decisions, but it does seem rather chintsy and cheaply made.  If you're looking to supplement oven cooking with a toaster oven, this is not the unit I would choose.  I saw a lot of reviews comparing it from a price perspective and I personally have been through a lot of toaster ovens.  I now use a Breville toaster oven which is double the price of this one, but before that used a Quisinart which did a great job, had temperature controls, timer settings and was about $30.00 cheaper.  This does have temperature control to bake items at different temperatures and it maxes out at 25 minutes from a timer perspective.  Considering the limitations and the price point, this would not be the ideal choice for me.  One nice feature is that it does cook well and quickly with the infrared technology.  My current toaster oven has to warm up to the temperature setting and this one starts cooking immediately, but again, you can't really bake a batch of cookies or bread in it, so it really depends on what you're looking for. I see this as more of a bachelor unit which has the quickness of a microwave and the size for single cooking.
