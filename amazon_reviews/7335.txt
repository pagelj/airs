RPi compatible
bought this for use in an RPi i recieved as a gift. SanDisk's seem to work the "best" according to the hardware compatibility list(s), and it did. further i have no reservations that it will continue to do so in the future; however for price/performance i would highly recommend one investigates the canonical 3 (patriot, mushkin, or pcpower/ocz) but also (suprisingly IMO) transcend has a valued (for good reason) place in this space. You should be reach a much better performance at the same cost. having said that; your risk/reward comparison should absolutely be based on previous user experiences not to mention canonical hardware compatibility list(s) previously mentioned.
