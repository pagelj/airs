After seeing the positive reviews on Amazon, this sounded like a good option for my husband and me. We were looking for the thermal carafe to keep the coffee hot, and because it was unbreakable. The biggest complaint is that when you pour that first cup of coffee from your freshly-brewed pot, the coffee is NOT HOT. It's close, but not there. So it is not surprising that 15 or 20 minutes later, the cup you pour is just lukewarm. I do not like to take my fresh brewed coffee and heat it up in the microwave! Also it is difficult to see the water level when you pour water into the reservoir. I am returning this to the seller tomorrow.
