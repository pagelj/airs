Works great for my Droid Razr Maxx, and the Cricket Huawei Mercury M886.
This external battery has been very useful for us. Pros:Holds several full charges. Compatible with many types of phones. Easy to use. Fairly small and lightweight considering what it holds. Cons:Some may think it is heavy and large, but hey, it is extra battery life.... Does not come with a power charger. Takes a long while to charge!!! I really like this device, but my only real gripes are that it doesn't come with a power supply and when you do charge it, the thing takes forever to actually charge fully.  But when it does, it is so worth it.  I have no regrets buying this. Make sure you get the right kind of charger for it.  I bought one from Anker, but I'm not sure it works or not because it didn't seem to be charging even after being plugged in all night.  I changed to my regular phone charger, and it took a while but did charge.
