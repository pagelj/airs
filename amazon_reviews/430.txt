Impressive Special effects + Bloody fighting scenes + Gripping Suspense  =  Surprisingly good
It's an Aliens plus Vikings movie. The special effects are impressive. The dragons look life-like and vicious. The fighting scenes are bloody. For example, there's a scene where a person was beheaded by the tail of the dragon. The suspense is gripping. For example, when the dragon hunted people and ate them in the fortress at night. The background scenes are spectacular. They show gigantic mountains, and beautiful waterfall. The love story is briefly depicted but it's touching. In short, it's definitely worth watching. I own it.
