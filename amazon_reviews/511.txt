King of the Toaster Oven
This thing is the best.  We cook everything in it now.  I am not even sure why I have an oven, because this cooks better than it.  We have baked cookies, lasagna, bread a little bit of everything and it is perfect every time.  The settings are easy to use and straightforward.  My wife was a little skeptical and wanted to buy a $30 toaster oven and this thing won her over on the first use.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
