Looking for a fun, orginal story to read this summer?  Look no futher!
All I can say is that "Riser" deserves to be up there with "Twilight" and those who LOVE "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."  Set in the future, this original story combines high school angst and sci-fi action with a strong female lead.  The author Becca C. Smith's ability to balance dark subject matter such as death and abuse, while still maintaining a sense of fun and hope is a testament to her gift as a writer.  I also find it refreshing that the main character Chelsan Deree is surrounded by supportive friends, who aren't backstabbing and two-faced.  A story about the power of friendship, even when the dark world seems to be against you.
