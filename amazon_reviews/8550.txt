Good but hard to use
I have a Canon 40D with 28-135mm zoom lens and it perfectly fits. This bag has everything than seller describes. One thing I did not like is you cannot take your camera out of the bag easily and neck strap is not fit in the bag. You need extra hand grip for take out your camera from this bag. But it is still really good bag.
