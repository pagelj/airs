Bought this product based on the other Amazon reviews, and sure enough - this little devil is great! I live in a 600sqft apartment, so it's perfect for me. No more sweeping, either. This thing is light, easily stored away and bagless! It got so much crap off my floor, I was amazed. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a small home or wants to use it for quick jobs. I used it in the living room, kitchen, bath... the coolest thing is that it is flexible enough to slide under my bed and suck up all the cat hair that has managed to accumulate there. I love this little tool, it works great. Probably best for someone with an apartment or small house.
