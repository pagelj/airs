Great product
This has been a fantastic find.  At night I plug my kindle fire and my Ipad 3 into the dual port and let it charge.  I travel quite a bit so it has been great to be able to charge my electronics with one plug, some hotels are limited with the amount of receptacles available. They charge quickly and I have had no issues.  Would definitely buy this product again.
