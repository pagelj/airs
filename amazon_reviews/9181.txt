Exceeded my expectations!
We bought this (used) in an online auction for less than half the price listed here. I wasn't expecting much... just that the thing ran, but after about three days of near-constant use I can say that I am thoroughly impressed! The picture is great, the sound is fantastic, and DVDs that used to always skip when I tried to play them in my old Mac laptop play perfectly in this thing. I guess they weren't as "dirty" and "damaged" as my laptop thought they were. Now, granted, it's only been three days, but I really love this machine (and so does my daughter). If it breaks down after three weeks, like another user said theirs did, my feelings might change, but I still might consider purchasing this same model again because it's just that fabulous right now... Oh, and I almost forgot the awesomeness of the battery life. I had this plugged in yesterday, but the cord got pulled  out (for who-knows-how-long), and the DVD played on without a hitch. I'm thrilled with the machine, and you probably will be too. But if the price is too much for you (as it was for us-especially at this time), shop around a bit.
