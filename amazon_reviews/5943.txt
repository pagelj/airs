Great Backpack
I punished this backpack and packed it full and carried it every day over a seven day vacation. And it was great. Love all the compartments, so it was easy to get to everything. I looked at some more expensive backpacks at an outdoor store first, but took a chance on this more reasonably priced one, and have been nothing but happy.
