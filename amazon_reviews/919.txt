Awesome camera
You just don't understand why you waited so long once you shoot your first photo. The light sensitivity is awesome; the colors are bright and true and the camera is rock-solid. Upgrading from a 7d is a huge step up, but controls and software still feel familiar and natural. Noise is extremely well controlled and definition is terrific. The silent mode is incredible and you really have to concentrate to hear a shot in a normally loud environment. All in all - ecstatic with my new toy
