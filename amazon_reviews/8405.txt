this will be good with some work...
Blade is beyond dull, took me over half an hour to beat anything resembling a decent edge into it (I prefer Swedish edge).  The wrapping may look like paracord, but it is just knock off crap.  Flint works well once you wear through whatever that crap coating that is they put on it.  Sheath is a crap design, but with a few modifications it might stop being such a fight to get it to stop snagging. you are not buying a knife, you are buying a blank that you can turn into a knife.  but for the price, it still isn't all that bad.
