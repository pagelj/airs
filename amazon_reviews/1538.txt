great picture, sound limited
great price during black Friday weekend, but wish i had stepped up for the unit with some outputs!  i didn't realize that the sounds (its ok for tv) , would be so high end, no bass... haven't watched movie yet ....  dont know how that's going to sound.. its for the bedroom so it didnt have to be crazy pounding surround sound bass. read that you couldn't add on speakers, never thought i would need them but going from a great maganvox tv with front facing speakers with a little bass to this, a bit of a let down.. if you like full sounds, go for a more expensive unit as i am going to try with sony dt 150 system, hope it works! if anyone has any experience in hooking up some extra speakers, people are saying that it can be used  cablebox via hdmi to sub system (sony ct150) then hdmi from sub to tv and that the video will pass through?  advice appreciated, thanks! amazon great, tv was there in 2 days, my first led tv, nice...
