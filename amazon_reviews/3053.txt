Bogus product
While this is a very carefully constructed copy of the Apple USB charger, it is not what it appears.  I purchased two of these units and they both lasted a total of three months before they ceased to charge my iPad.  Careful inspection shows that they are constructed poorly with a plastic rather than metal post and the internal electronics are not up to the task of providing a nominal 10W of power required by the new iPad models.  As this is my second Amazon purchase by sellers claiming to represent Apple or are Apple authorized sellers that turned out to be false, I recommend the new 12W adapter purchased from the Apple store.  These two worthless hunks of plastic will be going back to Amazon (if they will accept the return) or in the trash
