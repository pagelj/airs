I just can't live without a cordless Vacuum and this one is GREAT!  I use it for the bathroom, kitchen, by the front door and quick clean ups.  The charge lasts a good while and I can empty the tray quickly.  I even love the fact that after I empty the dust Tray,I can run water through the filter to clean it and it dries within a couple hours left on a paper towel.  It shipped quickly and was a great price!
