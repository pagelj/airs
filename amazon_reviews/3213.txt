No Disappointments
The product was easy to install and functioned as anticipated immediately. I cycled the charge three times and have just left it charging. It is holding at 100% Fully Charged. When cycling  the charge it  only took about an hour to run the battery down in my normal operational mode. The 4-star rating reflects my recollection that the original Dell battery lasted a little longer than that when new. Otherwise, I have no complaints so far and the "price was right".
