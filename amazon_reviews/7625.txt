I bought this set from Costco around a year ago to replace my old trash can and we love this product. At first I was uncertain about the battery life, but I've only had to replace the batteries once in the entire year of owning this. The sensor isn't too sensitive and I haven't had any problems with it not responding when it should, although we do clean off the top at least once a week when cleaning the house. People who come to visit always get a small scare at the trash can opening on its own when they go to throw something away which is always fun to watch. The smaller can is a nice bonus that we use in the bathroom, although the handle on that one can get in the way when I go to empty the trash bucket inside and put it back in, but other than that this product has been excellent.
