Tiny tools for tiny spaces
These tools make cleaning the engraving table and laser engraver at work a snap. They also work great for cleaning keyboards and computers. My only complaint is that the tools don't hold together as well as I would like. Maybe a locking system to hold the wands in place would help. The little brushes catch dust but don't suck up things that you don't want sucked up. The crevice tool is great for tight little spots on the engravers.
