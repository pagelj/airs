Dances with Na'vi
*** WARNING!*** Possible spoilers for two excellent movies follow:I haven't had the heart to write the review that reflected my impression to watching this admittedly impressive film a year ago. You couldn't miss the hype if you owned a television - I was an American serviceman stationed overseas and I knew well that it was a movie that featured exotic blue people, and people like Roger Ebert were giving the film the highest praise. I paid my 2000 yen to watch the film in a theatre with kanji subtitles playing beneath the original English soundtrack.  I was ready to be DAZZLED. The film started.... I started to be dazzled... Then, about thirty minutes into it I started thinking "hey... WAIT a MINUTE!"There was an absolutely excellent film.  It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Film, and was nominated for five others. ***HERE COME THE SPOILERS***  In this film a young soldier is injured, then sent to a remote location near mysterious indigenous people.  The healing soldier is assigned to infiltrate the indigenous people - to spy on them and report back to headquarters his findings.  But the soldier instead finds the indigenous people fascinating and in his attempts to infiltrate them he instead begins to find the indigenous people and their in-harmony-with-nature lifestyle superior to the life he had been living previously.  He joins the tribe and becomes one of their leaders and protectors, eventually coming into conflict with his original culture - those who sent him - as he defends his new culture. Of course the movie I'm describing is Kevin Costner's masterpiece "Dances with Wolves", and although James Cameron's "Avatar" is visually stunning, its plot is utterly stolen from the earlier film.  How was THAT information not passed in the maelstrom of hype that compelled me to plunk down my 2000 yen?  I would have been mentally and emotionally much more forgiving."It's `Dances with Wolves' in outer space with Blue natives", someone could have alerted me, and I'd have gone into the film with a different expectation.  If you give credit where it is due (i. e. not plagiarize) beforehand, I can enjoy your piece of art knowing that you developed it from some previously existing art.  But if you plagiarize, and I KNOW you're plagiarizing and you didn't fess up beforehand... it's unsettling.  Theft of intellectual property is a big thing. If "Dances" had never existed, and "Avatar" suddenly appeared, I would have liked it as well as Roger Ebert.  The visuals ARE dazzling.  The story certainly IS a unique re-interpretation of the previous movie.  The CGI effects make you believe the nine-feet-tall Na'vi scamper through the exotic forests and ride dragons.  Excellent acting from Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang and Giovanni Ribisi are on display. But when I hear that a movie is "original" one of the most important things that I expect to be original is the plot, and thirty minutes into this film I knew every scene that would follow.  That is a disappointment when you were expecting to be dazzled.
