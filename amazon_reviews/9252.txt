Perfect camera! Even better than my Canon 50D!
I currently own a Nikon D90 w/ Nikon 16-85mm 3.5-5.6 & Sigma 50mm 1.4 and Canon 50D Ef 24-105mm F4 & Ef 16-35 F2.8, both are really great cameras. But I like the Nikon D90 more, because I don't have to spend crazy amount of money on Lens to get a "IQ" like my Canon 50D, which I spent almost 3.5K. With Nikon 16-85mm I can get really nice IQ just like my 50D. And I can also record a video clip when I need to, I found out this is somehow pretty handful sometime when I want to capture something more than just picture. Over all I prefer Nikon D90 over Canon 50D for the cost, don't get me wrong, Canon 50D does feel really solid and take really nice picture with the "L" lens too, but just too much If you want the IQ like you see on Internet or some forum.
