Book to stir the imagination
I liked many things about this book.  The author, Jules Verne, is very good at describing and harnessing the imagination of the reader.  He made the story very interesting too.  It's amazing, to me, how much of this  fiction book is quite accurate.  I didn't dislike much of the book  except many times Verne got so descriptive that he stayed on the same  subject for up to 5 pages.  Which in turn tired me of the book.  Other than  that I enjoyed the book immensely.  I'd recommend this book to everyone  for hope that they will realize when this book was written and take into  account how much imagination was put into it.  If people only learn one  thing from this book, it should be to have an imagination
