I like it!!!
Contrary to United Cutlery's promotion the blade of this little knife was NOT razor sharp - and sharpening it is not that easy.... Nonetheless, the entire design and manufacturing quality of this mini dagger including its plastic sheath is so nice and well balanced that I immediately felt in love with it. Though the handle is quite small it is very ergonomic. You can even hold the knife like a push dagger, i. e. the  handle passing between you forefinger and your middle finger. I really like it! Should U. C. ever produce a slightly larger version of this design, for example with a 3" or 3,5" blade, I will surely spend some bucks on it.
