Low quality
I bought this for $26 and had pretty minimal expectations based on the low price - but I still had to return it.  The unit had some kind of unfinished or corroded paint or finish on the front, and some suspicious scratches like maybe someone tried to buff it and made it worse - but shipped the unit anyways. The unit also had an unreasonably short power chord - like less than 2 feet.
