Congratuations...
You've found it.  The absolutely worst movie of all time. Do you remember the movies you made in 6th grade for arts class with the script you wrote in an afternoon and cinematography shot in a single day?  Well it was probably better than Lunopolis. The plot is paper-thin.  The dialog is tripe. The acting is so bad that you can't for a minute loose yourself in the movie and forget that you're watching a middle-school production. How on earth did this turd end up on Amazon?  The positive reviews have to be shills.  There is no other possible explanation.
