Nice Product!
My wife likes Apple products and I prefer Android.  This device allows us to charge both of our phones at night while only taking up one outlet.  It also frees up our OEM chargers to be used for when we travle.  It's pretty fast, although I've never actually tested the charge rate.  All in all this is a great buy!
