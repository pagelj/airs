Have had this set for 10 years
I have had this Henckle pattern for 10 years.  I have a service for 12.  For some reason spoons disappear in my house, so tonight I am ordering another set to replace my spoons.  Order the whole set is actually cheaper than just ordering the spoons.  After 10 years my set still looks great - no rust spots as some reviewers have reported.  We use it everyday and haven't had any problems.  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great looking everyday or formal set of silverware.
