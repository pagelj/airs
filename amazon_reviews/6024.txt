Well done
I have small ears and always have hard time with headphones. This one is very good because the sound quality is very good, fits my ear perfectly and doesn't hurt even when I use it for hours and it's cheap. I have the purple and blue one and love them both! There might be better headphones out there in terms of sound quality, I actually have better ones. However for the money I pay, the sound and comfort is amazing. Warning: The cable is not very long, a little longer than an arms length.
