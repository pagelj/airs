Don't try to use headphones or it may never work again!
What a bummer! I bought this for an extended road trip with my daughter. It worked awesome for 10 days and then my daughter pulled the headphones out of the jack and the tip of the jack stayed inside of it. A little concerned but not paniced - my husband and I carefully took the player apart to dislodge the tip of the headphone jack from inside the port. The headphone jack port was a solid piece of green plastic with no accesspoint and was part of the mother-board inside the dvd player. Needless to say this was $60+ well wasted! =o( **JUNK~**
