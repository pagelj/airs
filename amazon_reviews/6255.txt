Awesome phone!
I always thought that iPhone is top of the game - I mean, Apple products usually are, right? Well, I was looking for a gift for my wife's birthday and I really didn't like price of unlocked iPhone. I'm not US citizen so I can't get it through contract, so my only option was to buy it for full price and lets be honest - it's greatly exaggerated. So, I opted to instead switch to Android phone. Woooooooooow! Hello thar! :)It took me awhile to choose which phone to buy and in the end, Inspire won with it's easily affordable price. Seriously, you can buy 2 of these for a price of 1 iPhone! And that is actually what I did - I bought one, used it for a week and went back to Amazon to order another one for my wife as the 1st one is staying with me. Lets be honest, though - phone is not perfect. Yeah, battery could be stronger (get yourself 1600 mAh or stronger one for roughly $10), software could be slightly more polished but in all honesty, this is a 5 star phone. PROs:* HUGE screen! And with high resolution, wow!* Easy to customize (software and hardware [i. e. stronger battery]). Take that, iPhone!* PRICE! Did I mention that you can buy 2 of these for the price of 1 iPhone? Seriously? Steve, you've been awesome guy, may you rest in peace, but your products have been greatly overpriced.* 8 MP camera! (not the best quality but surprisingly good)CONs:* Software could be slightly better. It does have some weird stuff going on, but nothing to tarnish this phone's great rep.* BIG! Seriously, forget about carrying it in your pocket. This is mini tablet, I kid you not. I still love it. :)For me, this is easy decision - this phone trumps anything else in the market when it comes to price/specs ratio. Yeah I know, everybody wants iPhone 4s, Samsung Galaxy S2 etc, but seriously, they can't really offer you much more considering huge price gap between them and this phone. I know I bought 2 for reason. Trust me, this phone rocks.
