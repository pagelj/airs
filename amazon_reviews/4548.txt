As a previous reviewer noted, the slots on this toaster are too short for some breads.  Commercial wheat bread doesn't quite fit in the slot.  After I force it in the slot, the automatic lowering device will work, and once the bread is toasted it apparently shrinks sufficiently that it will raise up automatically.  I like that slices of baguette don't fall outside the slots like they did with my old toaster.  Pluses and minuses.
