Good quality but...
I must admit I was very hesitant to trust an underwater camera that was so much less expensive than most other point and clip models of similar capabilities however I am very surprised with the quality of the pictures it took, unfortunately the cameras cons are too great and I will be returning the camera. Pros:Low cost for waterproof camera. Good for amateur snorkelingHandled salt water wellPicture quality vs cost of camera. Cons:Extremely poor battery life, takes 2 AA batteries, I was only able to take 50+/- pictures depending on if the flash was used or not and than camera had to be washed with fresh water (using it in salt water) and dried well to change batteries, naturally that is not a convenient process when you are up current half a mile from your belongings and taking pictures of a school of fish or something else that may not be there if/when you return. Defaults to auto setting on power cycle (unit turns off after some idle time and resets mode to default, this is a problem if you forget to switch back to underwater mode when using the camera underwater)Exterior finish chipping: The camera comes in 3 different colors but in just two weeks of using the camera a large portion of the color has chipped off.
