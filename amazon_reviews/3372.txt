Great product and great company!
I ordered one for our new daughter to help her sleep a bit longer and night and I think it did the trick.  The sound machine part stopped working and I contacted the company directly to explain the problem.  Within two days I had a new sound machine piece (separate from the sheep part) delivered and it worked great.  Excellent to have if you're traveling with a new baby!
