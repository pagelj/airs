perfect pictures
I pick this up as a special. It was the fourth camera I own. It was our first Nikon. It took clear pictures in low/indoor light and perfect pictures outside. It was easy to use, I really like this camera but my husband thought since it done so well we would upgrade to a better Nikon, which we did. Don't worries be happy this little camera was great!
