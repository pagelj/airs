Didn't last very long
I've had this exact model since around March of last year where I used it 6 - 7 days a week until sometime towards the end of September. I left it in my cabinet until I decided to start working out again today, pulled everything out and begun filling the jar with my protein and milk. Once I set it on the base unit and tried to mix it, nothing happened. The motor sounded like it was jammed, so I removed the jar and tested the base with nothing on it, motor spun freely. I then grabbed the bottom of the jar assembly and tried to move the blades with my fingers and to my surprise, I was barely able to get them to move. I've since let it soak in hot soapy water, ran it through the dishwasher but it's still jammed/hard to move. The little motor in the base unit simply isn't strong enough to move it. With that being said, I have no idea if it would still be find had I continued to use it up until this point. So if you're just looking for a cheap disposable mixer, this will probably fit the bill. Any kind of prolonged use followed by no use might not work out so well.
