Anxiety-Ridden Dog Can Now Be Soothed
I purchased this camera system to keep an eye on my dog and to find out what happens when I am away at work.  My neighbors have notified me that the dog barks constantly while I am away.  With the camera I can see for myself and with the talk feature on the phone app, I can communicate so the dog thinks I am close by.  So far it is working.  One issue, however, is that the connection reloads frequently.  Most of the time it will reset on it's own but I have had to completely turn my phone off a couple of times to reset the connection.  The issue could be with my home wi-fi connection, it could be my phone, who knows.  It's not perfect but so far it's getting the job done of helping me monitor the dog.  The visual quality is quite good, even in night mode, and the microphone is very sensitive.  I can hear people going in and out of neighboring apartments through my closed door.  At first it sounded like someone was actually opening the door to my home... a bit unsettling until I realized the microphone is just that sensitive.  As promised, the setup was quite simple and fast.  And the online tool for saving clips is very user friendly and self-explanatory.  I am hoping this continues to work.  At the moment it is a wonderful solution.
