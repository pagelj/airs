fabulous ~~not enough stars!!
This is probably the best CD we have purchased in ages.  There is a variety of artists, each incredibly beautiful.  Almost every evening this summer we sit out on the screened-in porch with a glass of wine and unwind from a busy work day listening to this CD.  It is better than going into town to a live concert!!!  You will not be disappointed with this CD!!!  Have a fabulous evening....
