Great, but short
I actually wound up purchasing the box set of The Billionaire's Obsession series because Mine for Tonight should be read with the other three novels in order. I liked the first book in the series and it was definitely sexy and hot but it ended really quickly in a cliffhanger. So I read the series together and they combine into the length of a whole book. I  liked the love story between Kara and Simon. I also love that for these stories are so well written and edited. This shows great care on the writer's part. I rated this book two stars because it needs to be read with the whole series not alone or else you won't get enough of the real story.
