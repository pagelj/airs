Best Bluray player out there currently
I watch a lot of videos via USB and Netflix. This player, much like the PS3 will play pretty much anything you throw at it via USB. The complaints about some formats not working over DNLA are valid but I believe its a copyright protection thing that all players are doing now, so I don't hold that against it. You do have to do the firmware update before you can use netflix, and you have to register on sony essentials and link Pandora to it before you can use it. But once that is done its great. Its currently at sams for the same price which is where I got it. The HDMI cable is short and useless if you're bluray is further than about 3 feet from your HDMI port. I had a better HDMI cable laying around anyway. I bought this so I can keep my ps3 hooked up into the playstation 3D monitor and have something just as versatile in the family room for the main tv. This bluray player did the trick and even has the cross media bar which i'm accustom to. The firmware update online said it includes Cinevia . . . which had me worried about some of my content . . . but everything still played fine. Pros:Netflix ButtonPlays mp4 and avi via USB, and other formats2D to 3D conversion that some players don't do (looks at you LG)Cons:Setupfirmware updateregister to use pandorashort HDMI cable
