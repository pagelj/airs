Good backpack.
Sturdy backpack. Insides a little different, all neon yellow, but still cool. Has a laptop divider inside which is conveinent, I put my binders and books that I need for school in there. Shipped on time and received in a nice protective box, and product was the one I ordered, so that's definitely a plus. Would reccomend this product!
