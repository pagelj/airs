Some of them were defective... kind of and then they all were
Its been a while since I bought these cables but that doesnt change my issue.  The problem doesnt even make sense.  The cables work with some devices but not others.  All devices are the same spec and compatible with these cables and some of the cables worked fine and some didnt. For example... Cable A would work with the bluray player and xbox but not the PS3 (80 gig) or the cable box (FIOS)Cable B wouldnt work with the xbox or ps3 but it would work with the bluray player and the cable boxCable C would work with the bluray player, the ps3 and the Xbox Slim but not the original Xbox or the cable box (FIOS)Cable D worked with everything for about 6 months then stopped working altogether.  It was never moved, cut,  bent or anything. Out of the 4 cables I purchased only 1 of them worked with every device I would try it on consistently until it decided to not work ever again.  They were so cheap I didnt bother trying to return them but beware.  Amazon actually offers their own brand cable which work awesome with every device ive tried them on.
