Not best plastic quality, but best price
The quality of the plastic isn't as good as I hoped, but the performance and price really beats it all. Its is truly plug and play, it is very easy to setup an use. It does not interfere with our wireless internet and that is a big relief with most 2.4ghz monitors available. I love the small hand held screen unit rather than the old big screen monitors that you can't carry around. The battery lasts a good few hours before needs recharging. There's a little belt clip but it feels flimsy. I hope it will last! Overall a great product if you are looking for something affordable and performs well in video/audio quality BUT do not mind the lightweight plastic. If it breaks, I happily got my 1 year warranty.
