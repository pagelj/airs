Superb product, Excellent Value - Would give this 6 stars if I could !!
This dual monitor stand from Tyke completely exceeds all my expectations. Installation was a cinch - took me less than 15 minutes to install with dual 22" ACER monitors. The product is SOLID - built like a tank, with a high grade black finish, and very well engineered. There is a plethora of adjustment options - not only can you adjust each arm independantly, you can make them come neared or further, rotate either arm, adjust the total height of the stand, even the vertical angle upward or downwards. This has freed up a LOT of desk space, and i LOVE reading web pages with the monitors swivelled in portrait mode. And the price is an amazing bargain. LOVE it, highly recommend it..
