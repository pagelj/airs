Cute, but not for college
I am a college student and got this bag for my "light" days where I didn't need my big laptop and only needed some notebooks/sketchbooks and lunch. While that's not that much stuff, some how the bag thought it was and my strap broke off after 3 months of 5x a week use. This bag is super cute, but smaller than it looks in the photo (my 15" macbook can't even fit in it  if I did need it for some reason). The "leather" is very cheap and sort of plastic-y, which is expected for the price. All in all, if you are looking for a bag for super light days, maybe your wallet and a lunch when biking around town or a coloring book bag for your kid go for it (I recommend sewing the straps on a little better when you get it before you use it so you don't have to later). If you want something to occasionally carry a little more weight, like for school, look for something a little heavier duty even if it costs more.
