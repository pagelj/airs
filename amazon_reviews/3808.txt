Quality Product, Deeply Discounted
I got this for $82 shipped. Unfortunately, a week later it was $60 shipped.  Oh well.  In any event, these have a very nice polished finish and very nice weighty feel.  The knives are the claim to fame as they have the unusual handle that makes them stand up. These weren't my first design choice (I like modern minimalism), but the more modern sets cost way more from quality manufacturers.  Sure, these are made in China or wherever, but I thought they'd make a nice 'my first set of grown up silverware.'  Plus I already had the Henckel 8 pc steak knife set.
