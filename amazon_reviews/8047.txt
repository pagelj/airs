Bought this Hoover "air" a little over a year ago.  Loved it.  Light, lots of suction, handy to use.....  I only have one problem..... I ran over a cloth belt and now the brush will not turn.  It was my fault not the sweeper.  But, I was wondering if I can buy a new moter for the belt.  Looked on line but, no luck.  This is a wonderful sweeper.  Going to keep it for the deep cleaning things since it is so light.
