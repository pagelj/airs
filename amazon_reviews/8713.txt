Worked, but not for me
I ordered this chair for myself on the beach mainly for the footrest portion.  My previous one had broken (diff brand), so I thought I would give this one a try.  Also, due to being overweight I was specifically looking for one w/a 250lb or higher weight limit, which this one had.  Unfortunately, my hips and big butt were too wide for the side bars on the chair so was extremely uncomfortable to sit in. However, my boyfriend ended up with the new chair and loves it!! So if you are a little wide like myself this chair is probably NOT for you, if you aren't then I highly recommend!
