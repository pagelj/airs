Poor quality.  Can't see screen once they are installed.  Most of them have junk in them
I guess you get what you pay for.  Never thought there would be so much difference from screen protectors.  These are complete junk.  They look horrid.  They are too small.  There's imperfections in most of them and they won't stay stuck to the brand new G3 I have.
