WD Passport External HD
I purchased one of these for all of my video's and just plain old stuff I thought a client might need later.  First I was really pleased to see how small this is.  The size was an added bonus.  I carry way too much around with me and I don't need the extra weight or have the space.  Second, I couldn't believe how fast that it transferred HD Video files.  The USB 3.0  speed is amazing.  I have been using firewire 800 and the USB 3.0 was much faster.  If you transfer large files you will definitely appreciate how fast this can do the work.  I bought 2 more.
