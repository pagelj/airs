Complaint re: Crawfords Superstore / generic response to feedback
Crawfords Superstore advertised a cell that looked identical to my Verizon flip-top phone, with one exception ... this was a wireless device with online capability, which I don't want (yeah, I know!), I discovered this, reading the packaging, though they had clearly said 'wireless' phone in the ad. (Yeah, I know!)When the phone arrived, I realized my error, and contacted the seller immediately. I sent the phone back pronto. But I have received only generic responses from the seller, Crawfords Superstore, to my communications. Maybe they credited my credit card ... I hope so. But I thought I would get  s o m e  kind of acknowledgment. Too impersonal. Maybe I am dreaming, expecting communication. Could be; doesn't impress me.
