Great Sony Portable DVD Player
This is my second Sony Portable DVD Player I purchase for my wife. She uses it religiously at home to watch her dvd in the comfort of the bedroom. This Sony, So far, plays every DVD that she puts in it. Lasts a long time on battery power and has a remote control. I burn DVD's on the computer and she plops it into the Sony and it plays it without a hitch. The last Sony wouldn't play all the DVD's that she put into the player. I haven't heard my wife screaming at the player because the DVD wouldn't play with this new Sony. Good model for the price.
