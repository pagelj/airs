This camera is amazing for the price!
I am really pleased with this camera. I have bought all different types of cameras and this one is a great camera for the price. My daughter is a photographer and she has an older model of this camera and loves it. She uses it just as a point and shoot since she doesn't want to lug her SLR camera everywhere. We liked the waterproof, shatterproof and freezeproof qualities. She normally only has a camera last for a year or so due to dropping it or getting it wet and this one has lasted over 2 years. So happy I took her advice and found this at such a great price.
