Miracle at Work!
I'm 17 and a few weeks ago I dropped my phone and completely shattered my screen beyond recognition. I didn't have 50 or more dollars to have someone repair my screen so I took a chance and did it myself. (With the help of some YouTube videos.) I managed to fix the screen for all around $7. That's great compared to the $50+ it would of cost me. My screen is back to normal and works like new. One of the best investments I have ever made. Ha-ha.
