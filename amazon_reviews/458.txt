Not much redeeming about this book
This book was pure drudgery to read.  The characters were one dimensional and the plot was so obvious it stung me between the eyes. (Michael HOSEA is the main character in a retelling of the story of Hosea? Come on!  Is that the best you can do? ).  This is just one example of the lack of creativity and originality of this book.  Awful!
