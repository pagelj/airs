Exactly what we needed!
A great product in a compact package... we bought this to accommodate our Samsung Galaxy S3 phones and an iPad for a vacation with our young son.  Being able to throw an extra charge into our devices during our flights made the difference between a happy flight and perhaps something less so.  Just what we needed for a very reasonable price!
