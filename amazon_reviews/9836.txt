I have had the corded quick-up for several years.  I have always loved the product for daily pet hair and litter clean ups.  The suction was good for a little daily cleaner, yet I always bothered by the short cord.  Now with my NEW quick up I am all over my two story in 20 minutes.  Then add the second battery,, I am a huge fan of these Eureka products.  I have my Eureka Mighty vac for heavy use (also a great little canister vac).  I just don't think you need to spend a fortune for convenience and good suction.  Amazon prices are amazing.
