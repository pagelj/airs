Good Product, but tempermental to get it to setup in WiFi
Nice product.. Much smaller than expected, which is fine; however, very sporadic in getting it to setup properly in WiFi network. It was seeing-it, then not seeing it with the wireless access key. Unfortunately, no real customer service w/ Roku to avail of to figure out configuration problems. Eventually, I solved it myself via trial and error. I wish Roku provided a list of proper instructions to give you some clue of what to look for when trying to add/set-it-up within my Home WiFi Network.
