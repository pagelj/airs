Worked as Advertised
Worked as advertised and expected. Buoyant enough to keep my Olympus Tough 6000 close to the surface of the water when dropped. No major problems, but i do wish it was able to get tighter on my small wrist, but that's not a big deal i just used my regular strap in addition to this one.
