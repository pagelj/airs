Sony has poor menus
As a portable DVD player for commercially recorded DVDs (Movies) this seems to work fine.  I bought this online and put in a Music CD and was expecting to see a menu with album name, artist, title track name, etc.  After all, the little $20 MP3 players do this.  Unfortunately, all it displays is the track number and elapsed time.  So if you are looking for something that will let you see and choose the songs you want to play, not so easy.  If you have a MP3 on a USB drive or CD, it will show the first 12 characters of the name, which may not be enough.  I'd describe the menu system as primitive. One other complaint, the on/off slide switch is difficult to use.  It is recessed into the case, which I suppose is good, but I always have to turn the unit on the side  and try to hook a fingernail onto the switch to access. One great feature of the unit is the USB drive input, load your songs on the USB and play forever.
