Excellent pictures, really small camera
Picked this camera up on sale during the last Black Friday.  For a compact point and shoot, it doesn't get much better.  It does well in low light and really well good lighting.  We usually use the auto setting, but I've toyed around with the manual controls and find it easy to control.
