I hope this helps someone. Pros:QuietZero smell of burned dirt or animal hair. It replaced cheep Chinese made Kenmoore which produced faul odor when vacuuming animal hairExcellent suctionLarge canisterLong cord Cons:Hose is too stiff and hard to maneuver. The design is interesting but using it is like fighting an anaconda. The self retracting hose makes it extrealy difficult on stairs and in tight spaces. HeavyDoesn't come with hard floor attachment. It will cost you $40 extra if needed. And if you need to vacuum under your furniture or bed you will need it! The base is to bulky making it useless without extra attachment which brings back the hose issue I mentioned earlier. Conclusion:Decent vacuum with a lot of suction power, but there is a lot to desire. Their commercial mentions all of the outside the box thinking and ideas but by fixing few issues other vacuums have they created a buch of new once. If all you do is race through your house and don't have to deal with furniture and stairs this is a perfect peace of machinery, otherwise look elsewhere.
