I prefer a dispenser coffeemaker without a carafe.  I like this one because it is tall enough to fill travel mugs and you can actually see the level in the cup as it rises.  Coffee is good and it is isn't too difficult to pour water in and load the coffee.  It does drip quite a bit when you open it to clean it, but doing it slowly with a paper towel works fine and I'm not sure any other one doesn't do the same thing.
