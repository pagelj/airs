So Far So Good
First off, for a really decent review of this item see the one by the Amazon User Neil E. Isenberg. He really details everything. For my part I just wanted to throw in a thumbs up for everything that has been said so far. I am very pleased with what I have seen come out so far including photos, standard prints and high quality images. In all cases, the printer did what it said on the tin. As far as some of the noise issues this printer makes, yes, that exists, but it is nothing compared to other printers of this type. I have been using ink jet printers for over 20 years and have yet to find a quiet one. On a very unscientific scale of printer noisiness, I would put the Pixma in the 2.5 out of 10 range (with 10 being obnoxious rock concert level). In other words, yes, you hear it but it is not like it wakes the neighborhood up. So far, the ink usage has been a bit better than expected.  I printed some normal pages and also a half dozen hi-res, full color images and while the ink cartridges took a hit, they did not drain to zero with one pass. I have not had to buy new cartridges, but they seem a bit more expensive considering you have more ink cartridge colors, but that is not such a big issue for me. If you are a hard core print person with either a lot of hi-res or large number of regular prints, it may make a difference. The setup was easy enough and it does help to be a bit savvy with your wireless networking. However, the network discovery worked really well and got me through most of the issues. The scanner works well and will suffice for most people's needs. Again, Neil Isenberg's review is far more detailed, but I wanted to chime in with my approval of the printer. After years of dealing with clunker, el-cheapo inkjets, it is refreshing to have a fairly sophisticated unit at my disposal.
