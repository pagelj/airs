Nice backpack for my 40D, 24-70, 28-200, and a flash!
It can get heavy real fast!  I still can attach a tripod to the outside.  It is a bit hard to get to because the opening is on the inside facing your back!  I don't see the need for such protection, but it was the only model that size on sale.  I am satisfy with it so far.  The main zipper seems to get stuck often as it turns with two angles to overcome.  It would be better if the zipper track was more round making the opening operation smoother.  Just don't drop this backpack with all that gear!
