Loved It!!!!!!!
I think this backpack was so amazing to me because I used it from 2nd grade to 7th grade and I still have it now. I happen to love rainbow, so I chose the color of "Peace Out." You Can Fit almost anything in there and the backpack can fit into almost anywhere. I definetly recommend it to anyone, any age is perfect. I want to keep this backpack for a long time. But best of all, if you want to keep it forever, the colors never fade out. So you will still notice the colors even ten years after you purchased it. I think I will definetly buying more things from Amazon. At least I'll be sure it will last a very long time. Horray for Amazon!!!!!
