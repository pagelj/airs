I've researched the art of brewing espresso and what type of machines to use.  This machine has everything necessary to brew espresso, cappuccino and other espresso drinks.  It is very attractive looking and is reasonably priced.  It is very easy to use as well.  Some other reviews said that this machine took a long time to brew a cup of espresso.  This is necessary in the espresso brewing process.  It heats up very fast and the steam time for frothing milk is more than sufficient.  Overall very nice machine and I would recommend this to others.
