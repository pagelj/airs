Awful. Worked fine for 2 months, now it's useless. It holds moisture so prone to odors and inner container has gone rusty, which in turn effects battery operated senor which is now defective.  This was not a result of mis-use, just everyday use in the kitchen. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
