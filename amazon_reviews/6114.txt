More than I bargained for.
This tomahawk is a sweet deal for the money, quality is superb, handling amazing, steel old school and strong! I'll try to break this one first then buy another. For all practical light axe use, and totally as a weapon. I dig this Tomahawkish make. I prefer the better tools especially where knives and tools are concerned. This tool does have very practical uses, not much you cant open without it properly. I'm sure at some point it will break & I have lots of leverage, this badboy torques 300ftlb easy. Impressive for the price.
