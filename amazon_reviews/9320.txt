DON'T BUY MEMORY FROM AMAZON
They're selling used merchandise as new.  I just received my memory card, and it was out of the package.  I just read the "Frustration Free" packaging blurb, which to me is a way for them to pass off used or counterfeit merchandise as new.  It would have been frustration free if I knew it was genuine and new.  Right now I'm pretty darn frustrated.  I'll be passing on future memory purchases from Amazon.
