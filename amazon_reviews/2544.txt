Prints are date stamped, no Option?
This is my third canon digital point and shoot, very happy with the first two, this one not so much. Two related problems:1. No manual, sure it is available online, but that means reading on screen or a bulky printout, Ugh!2. My photos are fine until I upload them to my computer to make prints. The pix all have a prominent date stamp right on the picture, and I can neither remove it or find a camera setting that eliminates it. I hope I am missing something, if not I definitely will return this camera and bid Canon a fond farewell. JJ
