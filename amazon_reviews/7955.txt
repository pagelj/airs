Just enjoy it
People seem to be criticizing the author's writing style and/or subject matter.  If you're going to scrutinize every last sentence, don't read this book.  If you're like me and just want to read a fun, interesting, thought provoking novel; read it. It's good, I promise.  You'll at least enjoy the action.  Don't be a writing snob, nobody likes a smart-pants.
