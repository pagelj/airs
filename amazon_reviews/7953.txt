Master your DSLR camera:A better way to learn digital photography
I expected a bit more from this book. A little more information would have been great. However I realized that the author is using this a marketing too to sell the rest of information that he did not allow the readers access to. On the other hand the information given was very useful which led me to check out his web site to see what else he had to offer a budding photographer. Consequently I would recommend this book and the authors website to anyone who is interested in becoming a better photographer.
