great
I do not consider myself a photographer in any way since I do not know anything technical about equipment or picture composition but I do love taking pictures for fun and this sure does the job.  As convenient as my camera phone is and the increasing quality --- I have a newer Samsung galaxy smartphone --- the photos often still come out unsteady more often than not and cannot compare to the kind of results I consistently get from this kind of camera. I have owned other camera brands but none with similar features to do a direct comparison.  This is my second cyber shot and I was so happy with my first one I bought this updated version without doing much intensive research on other brands since the reviews and prices were comparable for the features. The most noticeable thing for me is that even though I am not strictly steady this really helps me to take clear pictures.  Also the zoom and focus is powerful, easy to use, and, again, allows for very clear shots.  Overall usage is very intuitive and just took me one read through to understand.  Instructions are available for display on camera screen itself if you need a refresher.  Love all the features, love to play at being a photographer and take faux artsy shots, heh.  So great.
