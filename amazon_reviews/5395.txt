Highly recommended!
We love our Roku! We've had it for over a year and, although we originally bought it for MLB TV and game usage, we rarely use it for gaming. Setup is easy and it even connects to the old tv on our screened porch so that my husband can watch baseball games through MLB TV (you have to pay separately for this service). No HDMI cable required (Apple TV will only connect via HDMI), although we do use HDMI with our HD TV inside the house. We get the most enjoyment from streaming Netflix, Amazon instant video, HBO GO, and MLB TV. We also have an Apple TV (my husband bought it without reading the capabilities) but we rarely use it as it doesn't stream Amazon instant video or HBO GO. Hopefully that will change so that we can enjoy both services.
