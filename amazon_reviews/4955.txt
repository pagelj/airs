Meets my needs with no issues...
I recently bought a camcorder capable of shooting 1080p, and I needed the ability to shoot a few hours of footage at a time.  I have used Transcend cards in the past with no issue, so I tried this one out. After 2 months of use I am happy to say that there have been no read/write  or transfer issues.  All of the video saved on it has looked great, and it hasn't missed a beat.
