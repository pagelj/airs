Excellent, small camera; great value. Zooms in video.
This is a very well-designed camera. Received the packaged promptly as described by Amazon. com. The camera has a mild 'gritty' feel to it (to aid in grip); this is well-documented by fellow reviewers on this page. The picture quality is top-notch. The video quality is fascinating, especially when viewing with HDMI cable on our LED TV (the side port has a mini-HDMI out, as well as the mini-USB for communication w/ your computer). You are also able to zoom while in video mode, which sets the 300hs apart from it's friend the 100hs. The LCD and buttons in the rear-panel are intuitive, as is the selection menu for the various aspects of camera control. The menu and features are similar to other Canon camera products. The camera is small and neatly packed; My hands are above-average sized and the camera's size is about 1/3 of my hand. Therefore, it takes a a few shots to get used to not getting your fingers in the way of the flash, lens and microphone.  The microphone is located on the top panel, with two small holes. One strategy of getting to know the camera prior to your purchase is to go to a local electronics store and seeing the camera (or a similar one) first hand. As with any camera or electronic purchase, it's best to find one that fits your needs. Remember this camera will take high-quality pictures and videos, which will translate to increased power consumption (consider one or two back-up batteries (size/type: NB-4L) and mandate high-capacity memory cards. Our fellow reviewers have gone into much greater depth and all have done a fantastic job at thorough explanation. I hope this review serves as a validation to the quality and value of the Canon ELPH 300hs. Enjoy your continued market research, I hope you find the camera you desire.
