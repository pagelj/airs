Excellent camera
The only thing that's weird is that with the wide angle, anything that's a little closer looks a lot bigger. Few manual features.  The dynamic range is the biggest thing holding it back from being a truly excellent camera, but absolutely impressive that something this good can get to the consumer for this price.
