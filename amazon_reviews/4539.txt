Love it
We love this monitor so much we recommended it to our neighbors.  Only disadvantage is if you go outside your house you loose your signal (like if I'm on my drive way talking to a neighbor... don't worry I don't abandon my son).  It has good viewing compacity and the camera can be tilted down to see in the crib when baby is older.  My son even knows its his "mommies camera!"  Has infrared so I can see him at night.  Great sound.  I don't use the songs on it but they work well.  Would recommend again!
