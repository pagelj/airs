Works Perfectly after Firmware Upgrade
I initially bought this as an upgrade for normal wifi use with increased range from my old Linksys G router.  It was a huge improvement! After reading all of the specs and options I looked into making a network drive using one of the USB ports it provides.  During the setup process I saw the free DDNS it offers to start as glitchy at first to not working at all. However, after a firmware upgrade to the latest version, which you can find on their site, the DDNS worked perfectly for me.  I have a 2TB partition of NTFS and a 1TB partition of FAT32 which it sees just fine.  After loading backing up all of our media to it, we can easily see everything via our iPhone app from ASUS. I would recommend this router to everyone I know.
