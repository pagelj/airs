After HOURS of shopping on Amazon and checking out some models in person, I bought this one.  I knew going into it that MANY other reviewers had reported trouble with their unit, but it was also said to make great coffee that stayed hot in a TWELVE cup pot. Received the pot (about 5 months ago), added water, started cycle.  Some water made it into the carafe, then the filter basket overflowed.  Hmmmm. I must have done something wrong. Read instructions, checked placement, checked lid, triple checked, wiped up water and tried again.  Overflowed again.  Called husband into kitchen for second opinion, everything checked out on first glance. Tried again - overflow.  The problem seemed to be that the carafe did't sit high enough to fully depress the mechanism/button below the filter basket.  Husband had to re-seat the filter basket's gasket so it sat lower (about an eight of an inch) and would depress properly when the carafe is seated beneath.  I was skeptical that I'd find coffee all over the counter one morning, but it's been 5 months now and the gasket hasn't caused an overflow since.  It makes great tasting coffee and keeps it hot all day.  My only design request would be to have a larger opening to the carafe so a woman's hand could fit inside to clean it really well.  It does pour slow, but that seems to be the trade off for an system that keeps it hotter longer. Also... we called Cuisinart Customer Service and the woman answering the phone listened to the issue (before my husband tweaked it), and had no questions or suggestions.  Simply informed us to return it to Amazon. Not at all helpful.
