Decent p&s
I bought this for a survival trip in the Utah wilderness. I normally shoot with a lumix gh2 but certainly wasn't going to bring that. This camera worked great. Quick boot time and focus. Great battery life. I do recommend this camera. Pics are decent especially if you're not an experienced photographer.
