Works great
My daughter's car charging port (cigarette lighter) quit working and I couldn't troubleshoot it to find the problem. So I bought this for her phone. It will charge her phone at least week and mostly longer. Was hoping for her to use it for her laptop but apple sucks and makes the cord not be able to use a USB. I am thinking of getting one of these for myself as a backup in case of a few days power outage.
