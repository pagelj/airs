Why bother writing the 4520th review?
Because it is that good. Sci fi has many genres, from cyberpunk to space opera to mil sf. Some of it is very, very good.  Some is at best tolerable, even to sf readers.  Much of it is a guilty pleasure, good for the in-crowd, but hardly something a mainstream reader, unacquainted with SF, would be too impressed with.  Too geared towards technology, action or, sometimes, an inventive but obscure idea.  Not enough towards character development or big ideas.  When there are political messages they are often stereotyped:  evil corporations, corrupt politicians, heroic rebels. Wool manages to pull off a brilliant take on repression, information control, elitism and good old-fashioned Big Brotherhood.  It does so without resorting to high tech blabber, zombies, lasers or many other SF tropes.  Wool cares, deeply, about characters and it is about them, first and foremost.  It is not a book you'd need feel ashamed to pass on to someone who doesn't usually read SF. Had it come 50 or 60 years ago, Wool might have been considered as part of the greats like 1984 or Brave New World.  I don't think it will, though the mass of reviews and appreciation by the readers may yet prove me wrong.  Not because it lacks in power, but because there have been some many novels about dystopian societies since that its message is by force somewhat diluted and not as original as it would have been then. My one minor peeve is that Wool seems to be expanding into a series.  I've always preferred self-contained novels.
