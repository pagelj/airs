Poor quality software
I bought this radio with high hopes. After getting it installed I quickly noticed how buggy the software is. The GPS is really slow to start and if you push the GPS button more than once an error message appears but it's not even in English. Switching from GPS to the radio or even music on your iPod is choppy and slow, sometimes causing another error to appear. Overall, the radio is frustrating to use. I emailed the helpdesk at Pyle over two weeks ago and they still have not emailed me back. I won't purchase another Pyle product in the near future.
