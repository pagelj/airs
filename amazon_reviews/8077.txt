worked but not as good as other products here on Amazon
the glass is good no problem with the digitizer.. the issue is with the glue tape in the repair kit. This is not sticky enough and the glass pops right out. Make sure you get kits that use the 3M clue tape otherwise your repair will fail. I had to get another kit from another seller to make the repair worth the money.
