Need a bigger bag!
It's not the bag's fault I just have more junk than will comfortably fit but I get it all in. Lets see! T3i w/grip, 50mm lens, 15X55 lens, 18X135 lens w/hood, 55X250 lens w/hood, 2 extra Canon batteries, 8 AA rechargeable batteries,2-chips, 270 EX II Speedlite Flash & Quick Strap. It all fits (barely) and has to go in and out in a certain order but nothing rattles!
