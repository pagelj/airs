Dated and pretty disappointing
This book was very highly praised and I very much looked forward to reading it. I liked its anti-war message and theme. It was a good analogy for how alien and lost veterans of war must feel when they return home. But I have to say overall I was very disappointed. It seemed very dated. Its depictions of sex were juvenile and overdone and didn't really add anything to the story. I found there was nothing in the story that gripped me and kept me turning pages, wanting to find out where it was going, and what was going to happen next. If you like a good strong plot, then look elsewhere.
