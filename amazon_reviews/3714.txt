Okay
I wish there was more content.  Expanding on what is already there anyway.  That's probably why this is a series... but I still felt a little let down that there wasn't more.  Scott Kelby's writing style, on the positive, is awesome!  He is so funny and I think I laughed at almost every page.  Well written but needs more.
