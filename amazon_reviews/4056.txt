so far so good
The current one I am using is the first one I put on my Kindle like a year ago. It is still holding up very well. I am not abusive toward my electronics so, my stuff tends to be in better shape. Still the plastic has not started to peel or lose any type of stickyness. It did take me awhile to put it on, but I think if you put on right the first time it should last a long time.
