Actual memory  (27.5GB) does not match sold item (supposedly 64GB)
Product label states 64GB (as purchased) and does not  look damaged. The package arrived on time and not damaged but the actual memory on the card is only 27.5GB. It's quite frustrating and because I live abroad, I will not get a chance to return the item which is worse !!!
