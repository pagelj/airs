Quick and Easy
These ink cartridges are incrediably easy to install.  I'm a little disappointed in how quickly they run out of ink, and I am not sure in the long run that they save any money when you have to purchase twice as many cartridges at a cheaper cost.  Cartidges for other printers cost more, but seem to print more pages.  In the long run, I think it's a bust. I liked my old Dell printer better.
