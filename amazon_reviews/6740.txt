Works great
I just got his in the mail and tried using the AA batteries with the D battery converters on a battery opperated fan I also bought.  I did not have any trouble with the D battery converters as some had indicated and they worked great.  However, the 2 batteries were dead within about 5 hours.  I don't know if this was because they weren't fully charged when they arrived but I plugged them in to recharge today and will see how long they last tonight.
