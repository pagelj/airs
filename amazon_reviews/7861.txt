Great product.
Overall I really I like this product. It puts my phone at eye level for GPS and music needs. I've had it for over a month and have absolutely no issues with the suction cup coming unstuck. My only "complaint" is that sometimes the buttons to release the phone don't stay in the open position on the first try. But it just takes an extra second to do it again and then it's fine. My mom bought a different phone holder that goes in to the CD player, and she doesn't like it much. She's thinking about getting this one instead.
