Young adult?  Intruiging and difficult to classify
For many years the hero of this difficult to classify novel was close to his Grandfather, but considered the tales of his unusual childhood and upbringing with the scepticism that comes with age. But what if it was actually true?  What if there are perils out there that are inconceivable in the cold hard light of day? This is an unusual novel, probably classified as Young Adult as this is a story told by one such person, but it is unusual on many levels.  Realistically it is more a story of young compassion, devotion and dedication, and the struggle to be accepted it you are .... different.  If I have one small grievance it would be the ending (no spoilers here) but clearly there is more to come, and I would have preferred the novel to have had a stand alone conclusion.
