A great lens for baby pictures
I purchased this lens because I wanted something that could simulate the basic 50mm lens that my old faithful (film) SLR came equipped with.  In particular, I wanted a reasonably large aperture that would allow me to get the intimacy of close-in available-light shots of my new grand child.  This fills the bill perfectly!  The shots are crisply focused on the subject, but the narrow depth of field at close range with large aperture softens the foreground and background detail to turn a "snapshot" into a portrait.  My family loves the pictures I've been taking, and I love this lens!  One of the best purchases I've ever made.
