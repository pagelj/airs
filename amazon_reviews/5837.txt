Mounting bracket was backward
Purchased from digital_family.  Got the phone completely taken apart to discover that the six mounting tabs that have different spacing on the left and right side are backward. The left tabs had the right spacing and the right tabs had the left spacing. The bracket is glued to the glass so I could not fix this myself.
