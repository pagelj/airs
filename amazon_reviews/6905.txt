Awesome Digital Recorder
This is an excellent recorder and I love it.  Holds a charge, seems like forever.  Recordings are crisp and clear.  Background noise is mostly eliminated.  Compact, light.  Comes with a carrying case.  Has 4GB and also holds a MicroSD Compact Flash card for additional storage.  It's easy to use and navigate.  Records in WAV, MP3 or MWA.  It has a sturdy metal body.  I use it in my classes to record lectures, etc.  It has voice navigation that I wasn't expecting, but is pleasant to use.  Supports Audible Audiobooks, another unexpected surprise.  I love it and it was a great choice over the many out there.
