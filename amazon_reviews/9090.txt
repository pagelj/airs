Will not work as a true charger for your USB compliant devices
This charger does not short the two data channels on the USB port, so your device will think it is connected to a regular data USB port and charge at a slower rate. Maybe there is some other method that Kindle uses to detect how much current it can draw. Look elsewhere for a decent charger. If you already wasted money on this like me, one option is to get an additional adapter so that your phone will detect that it is a connected to a real charger and not to a regular USB port: http://www. amazon. com/gp/product/B009W34XMM/ref=ox_ya_os_productYou could also go for a charge-only cable, but for my application (stealth install) this was the best option.
