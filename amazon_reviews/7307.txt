Simple to setup and really easy to use with Iphone and WiFi
This a very compact color photo printer that can print from WiFi, a free Canon Iphone app, from an SD card or USB from a computer. Size: The printer is super small and you can fit in both hands easily. The printing from you iPhone works flawlessly and there is no delay in printing your pictures. I like it because you can print pictures for your friends right away and it's small enough that you could carry this on trips or to parties. Speed: The prints take 110 seconds each to print. Quality: Print quality is average for this type of printer and the colors are a little muted and the skin tones have a very smooth quality to them with some loss of detail. This are slightly lower quality than photos you would print at Costco or Target. There is a very nice LCD screen that has easy to use menus and the buttons are well sized. Negatives:Print quality can't compare to larger more expensive printers but it does a great job for such a small printer. It only comes with a few pieces of paper so you need to buy more. The INK costs about $29 and you can get around 108 prints per cartridge. Overall, would recommend it for ease of use and if you want to print pictures from you iPhone with an easy to use app. If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up. Thanks!
