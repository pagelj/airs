I love this book!!!
Redeeming love was one of the best books I have ever read. The characters were so alive. Ever word or page that I read I always wanted to know whats going to happen next! Micheal Hosea sounds like a teriffic guy! I wish I knew some one with the same personality. I loved it so much and I got closer to God by reading and understanding what He can do in our lives. I so wish that there was a secule and a movie to this book. I would buy it no matter what!
