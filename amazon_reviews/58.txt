Did the job wonderfully
I contacted the seller re: my system requirements and they assured this product would work.  I have to say that I am most definitely pleased with it.  Other reviews said that the lip sinc was out of sinc and I did not encounter that problem.  They only thing is that it took a little longer than expected but it did the job and I can't complain.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
