Our old unit which is almost a twin to this one has held up for several years, the door on the old one had to be slammed hard to get the latch to work properly, no adjustments and repairs would be almost as much as this new one. The food cooked in these invertors is better than non-invertor types whereas the food edges are not hard and crispy. This is a nice classy looking microwave and I would recommend to my friends and family. Also, the Amazon price was cheaper than other sites by $20. and Free freight/no tax.
