I decided to purchase the Hoover Steamvac Carpet Cleaner instead of renting one every time my rugs needed cleaning. The set up is simple, the machine does what it needs to, and maintenance of the Cleaner is very easy.  I was amazed (and embarrassed) by the amount of dirt in the rinse water. I researched several brands and styles before buying the Hoover. It is a great value for the money.
