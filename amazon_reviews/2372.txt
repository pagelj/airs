Kodak Easyshare Sport C123 Camera
I ordered this camera because I wanted a small dependable camera that would fit in pocket or purse.  I have owned four other Kodak cameras and loved them all, that is why I specifically chose Kodak.  This camera is very poor quality.  Had a hard time figuring out how to open the battery/memory card compartment.  When I did get it open, I tried a couple of test photos.  The quality was terrible. I decided to return the camera and could not get the batteries out.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I expected more from Kodak.
