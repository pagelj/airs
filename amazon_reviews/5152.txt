Bought by reading reviews. I guess I didn't read thoroughly.. The Microwave is a sweet buy, Nice look , Food cooks thoroughly with the spin tray and you can add 1 minute time to cooking by hitting enter so all in all for 900 watt microwave you won't be disappointed but I really wanted a microwave with a handle. The sale picture needs to redone.. Just saying
