Worth the Effort
I have read Gardner's anthology for years, it is a very good way to catch stories and authors that I have missed. Most authors/stories I like, some I don't, but its about 70% that I enjoy. The best thing I can say is the stories stay with me for a long time after finishing the book, it is definitely a mind expanding experience to read a variety of authors and their take on the world. I always end up buying the anthology every year...
