I've only used the toaster a few times, so I can't speak to its longevity. The good:Bagels and longer bread slices (like the wider Sara Lee loaves) do fit in the slots. The toaster hasn't caught on fire and burned down my house yet. It does, in fact, toast bread products. The bad:You can't toast just one slice of bread very well - one side will be nearly burnt, while the other side is not toasted at all.  (The manual actually even notes this problem, and recommends rotating the piece of bread halfway through the cycle.)The bagel setting doesn't work as you'd expect.  You'd expect it to toast the cut side of the bagel, and just warm the other side.  Instead, it just uses a higher heat setting all around, which does a great job at burning the bagel if you don't pay attention.  I don't think I'll be using that setting any more. The numbering on the dial initially looks like an LCD display.  Don't be fooled, it isn't. Instead, it's a regular dial where the font that's used for the numbering looks like an LCD display, and is backlit.  Comes across as pretty cheap and tacky in my opinion.  Come on, you couldn't even afford to put in an inexpensive LCD readout? Overall, I'm not impressed with this toaster.  I don't feel like it lives up to the Cuisinart name; makes me wonder if they outsourced the design to another company.  Then again, it's relatively affordable, so maybe I shouldn't have expected so much from it.  Nonetheless, I wouldn't buy this product again.  It -barely- earned 3 stars, and to be honest, I kind of hope it doesn't last too long, so I have an excuse to replace it when it dies.  It isn't terrible, but it isn't that great either.  It performs like I'd expect a Walmart store-brand product to perform; not fitting for something labeled as a Cuisinart.
