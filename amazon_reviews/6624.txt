Great bag, the best price
Bag fits my needs perfectly. I have a 17.3" laptop that fits snugly in the well padded laptop compartment, even with my padded sleeve on. No chance of damage to my laptop. The weight is distributed very evenly on my shoulder despite having a ton of very heavy books plus my laptop. There's adequate space in the book compartment for 1-2 full sized hardcover textbooks as well as a few notebooks. The 2 front pockets beneath the flap hold my calculator and laptop charger. The water bottle holder also fits mine perfectly. The zippered pocket on the front is nice for a few books or small things. Bag was delivered on time. Very satisfied.
