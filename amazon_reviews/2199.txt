Dirtiest Coffee Maker I've Owned
In less than a year's time, this coffee maker died. There was nothing especially great about this coffee maker in the first place. It reminds me of a fancier Mr. Coffee. The aroma feature was unique but made the coffee taste burned. There's no alarm to let you know when it's done brewing. One standard heating setting for coffee when it's done. It lacked a lot of features for the price tag. Overall I could live with it but it was the dirtiest coffee maker I've owned. I was amazed how it would get grounds in unimaginable places. I would have to clean the thing about every other day. I would run a cycle or two of water through the machine and was always amazed at how sediment was in the pot. Overall, I'm glad it died. Go back to the Cuisinart Coffee Maker.
