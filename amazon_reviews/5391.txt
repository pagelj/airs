Total waste of money!!!
Just got the tool today and it is junk!  Did not work out of the box.  Changed the battery like the instructions stated and the zeros on the display.  Instruction stated to pull the cover, but nothing as to how to pull the cover without breaking it.  This tool will be in the dumpster.
