5 stars for Jack, 1 star for Keely
I don't mind the fact that the book has no sex. It was a short, quick and free read that doesn't add much to the series, but it shows how great Jack is and how immature Keely is. Is there a thing that poor Jack does that she doesn't have to bend to her own will? I don't like too sweet heroines, but Keely's insisting and pouting is not a justifiable behavior for someone who's supposed to be smart and tough, especially on your wedding night. I don't know why I'm feeling this so much, maybe it's because at the end of her book I wanted to "slap" Keely for the way she messed with Jack's job and I wanted to see that she had changed a bit. It's five stars for Jack, 1 for Keely.
