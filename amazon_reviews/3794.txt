A truly impactful, jarring novel
Fahrenheit 451 is a novel that tells of a very grim, yet very likely future where books are burned, not to be read. But the novel is much more than that. There is more depth to it than a simple dystopian novel. It really is a warning to a future where TV and Film surpass reading ten fold as a prominent form of entertainment. It's not just the prophetic style that makes this a great read; It's also Bradbury's superior writing. The characters of Guy Montag, Clarisse McClellan, and Faber the Philosopher jump from the pages as you read.  You will not want to put this novel down, and there are too many things to be said about this wonderful book.
