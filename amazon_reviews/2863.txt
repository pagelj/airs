Great read!!!
This was fun a series (5 shorts to date).  The story line just gets better and better through book 5.  If your looking for an interesting take on the armageddon scenario and the human will to carry on, give these stories a read.  It is not your average life after the big one story.  I'm putting in my request for the author to continue. I will definitely will read more from this author and be anxiously awaiting more of the WOOL story!
