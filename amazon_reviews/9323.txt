This is the absolute best step can I've used - I have had cheaper models that never lasted - the foot pedal would break or the can was so lightweight it would tip over when you stepped on it.  This is very heavy duty for a plastic can and does not move when you step on the pedal. I love the quiet close lid and the fact that you can lock it to prevent pets from getting in. It is very sleek and stylish (I got the mocha color) - I couldn't be happier - well worth the price.
