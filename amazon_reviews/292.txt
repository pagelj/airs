Worth every penny
Pro's - easy to set up, parent controls are easy to understand, easy to hang on wall, great picture quality. Con's - short range - we have a 2 story ranch and it only works for half of the house. Battery life is short and we always drain fully and then charge 24 hours so it's not "user error." I only turn it on a few times a night when I hear her and don't use it for naps but still have to charge it after a day or two. Overall, worth every penny and I wish we'd got them in the beginning. We had audio monitors for the first 6 months and really wish we started off with this monitor. We opted for the 2.8 inch and there's no pan/ zoom option but we posted the camera high enough to view the whole crib and this works great. We highly recommend this product!
