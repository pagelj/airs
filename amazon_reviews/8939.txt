I did quite a bit of research before choosing my hand vac, and it was down to this one and a Bissell hand-held that had an attachment specifically for pet hair. I am glad I got this one. It is lightweight, powerful, not too noisy, and has a thingy at the back to wrap the cord around. There is also a slightly gimmicky but totally useful flip-up thing so you can vacuum on vertical surfaces. Very happy with this product! De-cattified my couch in under 2 minutes.
