Nice laptop bag
This bag is exactly what I was looking for in a laptop bag.  Not too big and bulky, but just enough room for the essentials.  It's well made, stylish and functional.  My only nit-pick is that it almost needs a tiny bit more space (width) in one of the pockets so my charger cable and mouse fit a little better.  But if arranged correctly, there's enough room for everything.  All in all, I'm still loving Case Logic and the products they put out!
