One Thing's For Sure, There'll Be Very Little Humor In The Future
With only four episodes making it to the small screen (and two that never saw the light of day until the release of this DVD set), I'd hardly call "Masters of Science Fiction" a true series.  However, Anchor Bay was nice enough to release all six episodes in a standard, thrifty two-disc set. These television adaptations do very little justice to the short stories they've been based on.  With a collection of authors such as Robert A. Heinlein, Robert Sheckley and Harlan Ellison, you'd be hard-pressed to find better printed material to work with.  However, most of the stories chosen follow the age-old science fiction format of "man screws up/future looks bleak."In my opinion, none of the episodes are stellar.  However, a few do stand above the pack.  "Watchbird," based on a short story by Sheckley, was one of the episodes that never aired on television.  It should have.  It shows you how bad things can go when a weapon designed for military use is integrated into normal society.  "The Awakening," based on a short story by Howard Fast, blends religion and science fiction and comes very near to being great.  The best of the lot is Heinlein's "Jerry Was A Man," and, as expected, it features the most humor of any of the episodes. The casts for each episode are wonderful, and range from Anne Heche to Malcolm McDowell to Sam Waterston to Sean Astin.  Unfortunately, these actors aren't given a lot to work with. With just a little bit more hope added to the show, "Masters of Science Fiction" could have been wonderful.  Instead, we are offered another run-of-the-mill dismal future to look forward to.  I recommend this series only to hardcore science fiction fans as a purchase.  Everybody else can rent it and skip ahead to the shows I mentioned above.
