Great Sharp Knives for a Low Price
I have been using these knives for couple of months now, and everything is great! The knives are SO sharp and sturdy, looking nice, and yet the price is so *reasonable* for a set of eight knives. Doesn't cost a fortune for what I need which is good. These knives really cut thru the meats smoothly with no problem at all. I can also throw them into the dish washer and everything looks okay so far which is another big plus because I am so lazy to hand wash them. This set of knives doesn't disappoint so far! The only thing I wish is that a box may come with it for storage, but considering how low the price is... I can't complain! What I was looking for when I purchased this:1. Sharp and study knives that serve its purpose2. Nice looking3. Reasonable price4. Dish washer okayIf you are looking for the same thing, then I would highly recommend it! But if you want some very fancy top of the notch knives, keep looking.
