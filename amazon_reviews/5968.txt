Still scared?  Don't be!
I'm on a super tight budget, so I winced hitting "place order" after coveting this lens for a couple years now.  Yes, it was tough because of the cost, but once I had this puppy in my hands all cons disappeared.  Beautiful bokeh, sharp as a tack- just all round gorgeous hunk of glass! Canon did not disappoint--I couldn't be happier!:D
