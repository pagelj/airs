Have to say, I think this is great!
While it fits somewhat awkwardly on the flash, it works great. I love that it removes the harsh light from the subject that a normal flash gives off. I also use this for photographing saltwater aquariums and it's perfect! Doesn't reflect off the glass, adds a great white balance (removes the purple color cast from the tank lighting) and still freezes the subject.
