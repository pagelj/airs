High remarks are well deserved.
Well done. This is like a cross between Orwell's 1984, Plato's Allegory of the Cave meets a post apocolyptic world. That might not have made sense, but this is a good read. I found the pace to be a bit slow, but exciting at the same time. There were no dull moments in this story. I rented this book through the Amazon Kindle Library and unfortunately for the author, didn't pay a dime for it. This is a long book however and I would have gladly paid the 5 bucks for it otherwise. There is a lot of politics, some mystery and some real thought on the survival of the human race through extremist action. Normally I would vote for more action, but the small amount involved in this book was just enough as to not distract from the true intentions of the plot. I absolutely reccommend this one.
