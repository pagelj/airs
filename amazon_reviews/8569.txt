Thanks and a story for you.
Unfortunately I was only able to use it one time, due to my mistake in setting up a Paperwhite that I bought for my husband, which I returned and was given the proper credit to his account. At the same time I returned the Paperwhite I enclosed the adapter, in it's own envelope, with the Kindle and have not received any credit for it.  He has now ordered the Kindle Paperwhite 3G and the adapter, which will be delivered on 1-24-13. Thank you for the many years we have enjoyed your services and we look forward to the new one to assist him with his failing eyesight. Kay
