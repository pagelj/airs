I like it. Not bad for then price.
I was given this camera to replace my Konica-Minolta Dimage, it isn't being made anymore. Let me say this is no Dimage. But it is a lovely little camera. I needed it to take pictures of products. With my old camera I had special aperture settings. I was surprised that this camera was perfect with the automatic settings and two 100 watt daylight fluorescent screw in bulbs. No special setting needed. Very little Photoshop adjusting to do. The other reasons I wanted this camera was the ability to do movies and it seems to do that. I only gave it a quick try. 14 megapixels was a shock. Large files but great detail. I love that is uses regular batteries. In a pinch, in the field and you need new batteries you can buy them anywhere. I use rechargables and always have an set ready to go. I use a tripod to take pictures but the camera seems to have anti shake and all of my pictures were sharp. This camera is plastic which makes it lighter than my Dimage. It does lots of things and would probably be great for taking pictures of people. It does close-ups and that can make it fun. IT DOESN'T COME WITH A SD CARD! So you will have to buy one. Be careful as this camera won't work with the Extreme SD cards. You need to look for one with a "4". I got a card 16 gig card for under 20 dollars. The manual is thin and easy to grasp. Not the tome I had with my friends' Canon Rebel. I was taking pictures very quickly. You can't beat the price when you compare it to the changeable lens cameras. It is, like the call it, a bridge camera. It is cute, light, and full of fun features. The continuous mode looks intriguing as my cats never sit still. I always get a picture of the backs of their heads.
