I bought the Mr. Coffee cafe latte maker as a "might work" on the recommendations from others on Amazon, especially the informative video from Ms. Karchner. I have been pleasantly surprised. While it will not produce the same lattes than my local barista generates at $5 a drink, I do not have to wait in line and the machine has paid for itself in a couple weeks. And the lattes are most acceptable. I am still experimenting and learning to best use the machine. So far I have concluded that making a single cup yields better results than making two at the time.
