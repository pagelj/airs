This is our first espresso maker in our home.  We've had it for several weeks now--many many cups worth--and we're still impressed.  It makes a wonderful cup of espresso, and lattes too.  It is well thought out, and well put together; seems very solid.  Instructions were good.  This was a great buy for the money, and I can't imagine the espresso makers costing hundreds more being any better than this.
