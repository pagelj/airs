Amazing Camera
Takes amateur photography to a new level. I used to have a Canon SLR 10 years ago.... then switched to digital point and shoot camera - primarily because of convenience and portability and also because wasn't really impressed either with the quality OR the price points of DSLR's at that time. This camera addresses everything. I shoot mostly personal family pictures, kids, functions at home and landscapes when traveling. Have it paired with an EFS 17-55mm f/2.8 (my only lens so far!) and image quality is mind-blowing. Great bokeh and low light performance. I rarely use the flash. Rich, true and vivid colors even in low light with no flash. Would have preferred to get the Full frame 5D - but body and good lens combined were beyond what I wanted to spend on my first DSLR. Plan on using this as my first DSLR to get aquatinted before thinking of upgrading to a full frame. Have a friend with the EOS 5D and I confess that the picture quality of 5D with a 24-85mm f/2.8 is quite better and its the must have camera for anybody with serious ambitions in photography or spare change. In features and options though 7D is equal to the 5D if not better. But for starters - the EOS 7D is great - in fact exceptional. To realize its best potential pair it with a good and fast lens and NOT with one of the lenses that come packaged with it.
