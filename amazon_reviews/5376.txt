Gus'  review of the E-PL1
This is a great camera... after paying $600.00 for the camera ... we will have to wait until the converter to my E-500 lens comes down in price as I have quite a few lens for the E-500... We didn't want to have to take the E-500 to Hawaii with us since it is much larger and heavier than the E-PL1... I think around $100.00 is enough to have to pay for the Olympus MMF-1 Four Thirds to Micro Four Thirds Adapter.  The cheapest that I have found it for when searching the Internet is $160.00... Maybe it will get down to a decent price before we go on our next big trip after our Hawaii trip... The instant ways that you can change the settings is absolutely great... You will have to go into the menu and fix the video start red button to work to instantly start the video as advertised... I thought the red button on the camera was broken for several weeks after receiving the camera but searched out the menu and found the setting for the Red Button... all... this truly is a great camera!
