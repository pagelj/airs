Great Cable at a Great Price
I bought the Belkin HDMI cable off of Amazon for use with my Apple TV, and I always had problems with it.  It would always have a loose connection and I would have to "jiggle" it around to get it to work.  I finally got fed up and bought these cables.  They work like a charm and are much cheaper.  I highly recommend them!
