Easy Easy Easy
The set up was super easy and it works pretty much like it says.  The channels are many, but I don't find much on the free channels to interest us, maybe except Crackle.  We already subscribed to Netflix, Amazon Prime and HuluPlus (Netflix is by far the best if you must choose one), so it wasn't a big deal. Yes, you can just hook your computer to the TV and play these same things.  But somehow, with my set up it always got complicated.  At times I might still do that for a network replay, but not too often.  Not to mention having a remote is sorta nice! I look forward to the growth of internet entertainment and think this is THE way we should all be going.  I look forward to some homogenization of the various channel options - the menus vary between some of them so if you aren't technologically flexible this might be a tad confusing at first.  Most should adapt quickly to it.  You can always hit "HOME" if you get stuck  :)Our internet speed is slightly slow for the Roku and I can say it barely matters.  At times, rarely though, it will get hung for a few minutes.  Not much of a bother, since I don't want to pay to go up a tier on my internet service!
