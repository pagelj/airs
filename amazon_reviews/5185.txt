Slow streaming
We have fast internet, but the Roku would never preform up to speed. Our movies would never do HD, and then it was constantly buffering. We were so annoyed that we returned it, and have been using our blue ray and laptop to stream movies to our TV. If we could hard wire the roku it would be great, but this model doesn't do that, and the chords become a whole other problem to solve.
