Tablet Bag
Needed a bag to put the tablet stuff in. I go to my nearby military base food court to while away the day surfing the interenet. I put the right protection to make sure it stays safe and secure. This helps me keep things together and it protects the stuff from bumps and thumps. Plenty of pockets and two bays so thing don't bang together.
