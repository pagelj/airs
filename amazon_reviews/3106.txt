Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900This is an excellent carpet cleaner.  I have always rented a machine in the past, but because I have so much carpet to clean and I don't have the stamina I used to have, I knew I wouldn't be able to clean it all in one day.  Therefore, I decided to buy my own cleaner so I could take my time and clean at my own pace without the expense of renting for an extended period of time.  I did some research and decided to buy this machine.  I am glad I did.  I have cleaned the carpet in three rooms and a large hall as well as the vinyl floor in my kitchen and dining area. (one room a day) I was impressed with how clean and dry the carpet was when I finished.  Also, the kitchen floor was clean and dry when I finished it.  It doesn't hold as much cleaning solution as rental models do, but it is a lot easier to fill and carry since it is much lighter.  I highly recommend this Hoover cleaner.
