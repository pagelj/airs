A convenient to use charger
I bought the iCarrier on the recommendation of a guy who I sat next to on a flight recently.  He said he had "several" New Trent chargers, and that they were great.  I needed something to charge a pair of iPhones when I'm travelling, and this seemed like just the thing.  Once it's fully charged, it can supposedly charge an iPhone 5 or 6 times.  I've charged mine twice, and the battery meter on the iCarrier it still showing that it's maxed out.  The other nice thing was that it fully charged my iPhone in about half an hour.  Not too shabby!
