We're old enough that we've used just about every type of vacuum out there, from so cheap they fall apart in 6 months to those that come with a free home equity loan packet - Dirt Devils, Dysons, Rainbows, Kirbys, Hoovers etc.  Each of them have their strengths, but when it comes right down to it all most of us want is a vacuum that's easy to use, sucks up dirt and hair, doesn't spray dust all over the house, doesn't take an engineer to clean, and won't break your back or wallet, right?  So when our old vacuum finally gave up the ghost I quickly researched options, trying to stay under $250 for something that just worked. Guess what?  We found it in this kit. The main vacuum unit is listed at 12 lbs but it feels a bit lighter than that, and when in use it positively glides across carpet, rugs or hard floors.  Just about everyone has HEPA filtration today, so that was another check in the right box.  Unknown to us at the time, but another pleasant surprise, was how easy the bags are to change.  Our previous vacuum was bagless, so we didn't look forward to this particular chore but it's almost as easy as dumping a canister and you only have to do it once every month or so.  I hesitate to say it (and hope my wife doesn't read this review) but I find it so nice to use when compared to our previous units that I actually don't mind vacuuming the house. What really seals the deal for me is the performance and ease of use of the portable canister.  I have a Shop-Vac and various small handhelds I've used for various tasks (cleaning cars, trying to vacuum carpeted stairs, curtains, upholstery, etc.) and frankly, they are all terrible for these tasks.  Too big and bulky or so under-powered I might as well be trying to suck up lint with a camera lens cleaner bulb.  Granted, I wouldn't use the canister in this kit to suck up nails or water (that might produce some rather amusing side effect), but for just about every other kind of normal cleaning it's great!
