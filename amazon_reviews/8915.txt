Nothing beats soap and water
I bought these and I bought Bosch and Lomb wipes.  These are better than Bosch and Lomb but are still no substitute for dish soap, water, and a good clean eyeglasses microfiber cloth.  I clean my microfiber cloth every week with dish soap and water and let it air dry.  These wipes still leave residue which is noticeable if you hold your glasses up to an lcd monitor.  Soap, water, microfiber cloth all the way.
