Good for day-to-day use
Nice tab and I'm glad that I purchased it. it's sleek and very responsive. Movie quality when watching off SD card is good, it is not choppy at all. The screen is very responsive and overall the experience with this is greatedit 12/10/2012: For watching movies, download & install the "MX Player" app + codec from Google Play (2 installs). It is able to use h/w acceleration and makes a big difference.
