Best camera I've ever owned!
If you want a professional-grade camera, but don't want to spend thousands of dollars on DSLR and complicated lenses, then this piece is for you. Even photography snobs would agree that this is a hidden gem in the world of digital shots. Canon is a classic brand, and this camera lives up to its name. The picture quality is outstanding at any time of day, even in low light. The camera has a lot of neat features that will make your photo-capturing experience a fun one, but it may take you a while to figure it all out - even a tech-savvy person can be overwhelmed by the new features. Battery life works well for recreational use, but if you're serious about your work, you may want to carry a spare. Love the compact size - very easy to transport, but be careful not to scratch the screen. Overall, this is a fantastic camera and I would recommend it to amateur photographers, as well as seasoned vets. This year's best kept secret: although they may turn their noses up, deep down they secretly crave the Elph!
