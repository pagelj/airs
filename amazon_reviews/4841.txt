Slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!
Obviously, I paid $40+ expecting to get more than an A/V to USB adapter.  Here was the problem; the video from the tape was saved as a large MPEG file (understandable.)  I wanted to burn the DVD with a nice menu and transitions.  The software was friendly, however, the burn process converts MPEG video into some other format, which takes a long time.  I use IMToo Video converter (Ultimate) to convert videos from one format to the other.  It had never taken more than 1/2 hr even for very large files. This product is a waste of money in my opinion.
