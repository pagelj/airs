Tamping The Vampire
I enjoyed this ebook short story. Liz was tough, hard-core and emotionally vunerable. Her dislike of vampires is understandable, and her need to fight the desire she feels for Jack is a normal reaction for anyone to have. Jack has a hard surface, but is really soft, and open to hurt deep down. I loved the chemistry between the two and Jack and Liz's ability to see past their differences and find love.
