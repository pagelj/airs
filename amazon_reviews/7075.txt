Black organizer purse. It is a very fair price and very happy with it.
It is all leather and lined in cloth. I love the organization pockets and no need for wallet to lighten the weight of carrying a purse. Plus purse is nicely built real leather not a heave leather but strong. So purse itself is not real heavy. Everyone tells me my purses are so heavy to carry not this one. There are plenty pockets and zipper sections. Easy to get at so make up easy, keys easy, glasses easy, cellphone easy, credit cards and money in zippered section easy for you but not someone trying to steal your money. I would and did order another one in different color after receiving it. Now remember it is under $30.00 not a $200.00 dollar purse so no fancy tassels, studs etc but it looks good and I added a purse jewelry with crystals and silver charms and it really dressed it up.
