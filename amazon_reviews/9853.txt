Ok, but not great.
Hmmm... I'm really torn about this lens. My copy is extremely slow to AF at times, particularly at the long end, which has resulted in missed shots more than once. AF can also be very LOUD in addition to being slow. However, other times it works perfectly and gives me amazing shots, so it's a bit of a coin toss. When it does behave, it's a fantastic lens. The VR helps a lot and I'm not getting the softness that others mention. It also doubles nicely for a portrait lens when you're in a pinch or only want to carry one lens. As others have mentioned, there was some dust on my glass as well but it never shows up in the image so it doesn't bother me too much. I got this at a discount b/c I bought it with the D700, so for the price I paid it's a good lens. If you're shooting FX then this is a great, cheaper alternative to other FX lenses in this range (assuming you want new glass) but for DX shooters, I'd spend my money elsewhere. I would much rather pony up a few extra hundred and get the 18-200 instead, which is what I have on my DX body 90% of the time. I hardly miss the extra 100m on the long end, and the extra 50m on the short end is far more usable. It's also quite heavy (despite all the plastic) so on a DX body it feels unbalanced and far too top heavy. Overall, if you shoot FX, go ahead and get it but keep your fingers crossed that you get a good copy. If you shoot DX, skip this and get the 18-200 and never look back.
