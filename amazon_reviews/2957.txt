Very Powerful! A Worthy Upgrade from the N56U
I upgraded from an N56U. After the N56U, I wasn't expecting much to be able to surprise me, but the N66U is a BEAST! Let me first say that the N56U is a very capable router, with fantastic range, easy-to-use firmware, and some amazing features. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a router with massive range, USB ports, and customizations. Moving on... The N66U is, by far, the most powerful router I've had the opportunity to use. The firmware got tweaked from the last generation, and it is even nicer to use, and the advanced options are more extensive. The range is boosted even higher, and it also has the transmission power output easily adjustable (default 80mW, up to 500mW in the US, up to 100mW Europe, per frequency). Truthfully, I'd be scared to see what kind of range full power could get. At the default setting, I have signal over most of my block already. The N66U supports up to 6 Guest networks (3 per frequency) simultaneously, in addition to the 2 main networks. USB supports flash drives/external HDDs, USB modems, and printers. Antennas are swappable for higher gain if you need it (along with the adjustable power output, this would make for insane range). QOS has more options, allows adjustment of rules for upload and download speeds based on IP, ports, file size, common games, common protocols. Has lots of VPN options. What more can I say? The N56U was able to blast away the best Netgear router for range and stability. The N66U is very much more powerful. Also, the N66U has double the RAM, and a larger ROM, allowing it to support third-party firmware (but try the built-in firmware first, you might be surprised). If you're looking for the best (until there are more 802.11ac products on the market), this is the router! Look no further!
