After doing research on which vacuum to buy,  I finally settled on the UH70210.  CR has it marked high as well. After receiving my new vacuum, I first used my old bagged one, than immediatly, used the new bagless one.  This was tested on a 6x6 area rug.  I spent 5 min with old than 5 min with new one.  After using the new one, I had to empty the waste bin.  Thats how much was left from the old one.  I just could not believe how much extra this vacuum picked up.  10 min later, I showed how it works to a family member on the same rug and it still picked up hair and dust. I still saw some hairs left on rug when I inspected very closely.  But not much. I also tested the powered hand tool on a loveseat that my pet loves to stay on.  It picked up all the hair within 2 passes of the tool.  This was pet hair that was deep into the fabric too. There is some assmebly required, but it was nothing to worry about.  It was one phillips screw and the rest was tapping and clicking into other things. Besides, there are videos on how to do everything you need right on Hoovers website. The fold down arm is great for storing it. There was no burnt pet hair smell during vacuuming like with my old one.  There was also no noticable kick back hitting my feet. The waste bin is easy to empty but the dust and powder still circulates around, better to empty outdoors. The hand tool is really powerful and easy to use but you have to find the right angle for it to be effective depending if you have loose or tight fabric. After showing this model off to family and friends, now they all want a new vacuum. I would highly recommend this to anyone thinking of buying a new vacuum. And HEY, after all, its still a Hoover.
