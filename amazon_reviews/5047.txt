Frustrating:(
HP tried to make this into a modern design with lots of extra gadgets, and wound up with a disappointing product. I bought this computer because of all the great reviews.... I wish that I had first gone to Best Buy and demoed some others first. I am not one to go on and on but I would not recommend this product, because of it's many ridiculous nuances. I have been using computers for 30 years, and this is the first time I have been disappointed.
