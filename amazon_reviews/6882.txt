Much better quality than other colors.
I think a lot of people get on here and just give 5 stars if it meets basic needs of the items. To me 5 stars is above and beyond my expectations. This has been my favorite color ordered. A lot of colors you order will be flat and not have the nice round shape cord should have or it's really thin. This woodland camo is thick and perfectly round. It's my favorite color and will be getting this for my Bug out bag.
