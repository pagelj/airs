problematic order
The product was everything I expected, but the shipping and handling was ridiculous.  These things are bamboo and weigh hardly anything.  All came in the same envelope.  I understand this is an Amazon problem, but it seems to me that the vendor, understanding this, should make some compensation to his customers to avoid bad feeling.  He's getting the overage and should be willing to make amends to his customers without anyone needing to ask.
