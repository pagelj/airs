This movie is freaky as frick.
I totally can't imagine watching this movie as a little kid; I think it'd freak me out. That fireman clown is terrifying, and the air conditioner is pretty freaky too. Plus, the acting's pretty miserable, as are the songs, and the plot, which consists of a whole bunch of non-sequitur scenes. But that said, watching this in my twenties with a bunch of friends is a lot of fun. Many, many parts of the move are so blatantly awkward and awful that's it was great to watch "Mystery Science Theater 3000" style, making fun of the movie as we watched. A few favorite things from the movie:-"What are you going to do; suck me to death?"-The Chester-the-Molester-esque air conditioner-Trying to come up with a drinking game for every time someone says "Master," or every time someone makes a bad pun-A whole bunch of cars singing a country song as they're about to get crushed to deathI've never tripped on any sort of drug before, but I imagine doing so while trying to create a movie would result in something a lot like this film. Not recommended for kids, but definitely recommended for the young at heart.
