Low Light
ok I own a Canon 50D and the Nikon P7100 my daughter wanted a camera for Christmas so i started reading reviews about point and shoots and the XZ-1 keep popping up... I have never owned any Olympus cameras before but the price was right and I ordered it... she used it that night and I couldn't believe the shots she had in very low light with no flash... if you need a P&S that can take pictures in low light please look at the XZ-1
