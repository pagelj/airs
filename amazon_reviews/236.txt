AMAZING!
Oh my goodness Sarah, I loooove your books! I got Daughter of Time free for kindle & let me say I am so thankful I did, it is hard for me to find books that I want to read, your books are the ones for me! I only wish you could write them as fast as I can read them =] it took me 5 hrs to read the first book & now I am burning through the rest. You are a beautiful writer, thank you so much for writing these books =]!!!
