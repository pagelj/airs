Cuts Glare
My husband used to complain about glare when reading his kindle, especially if a book light was used.  These films do help to cut the glare and protect the screen.  They do fit perfectly.  My only complaint is that they can be tricky to put on.  It can take a few tries before most of the bubbles are gone.  They give you a cardboard square to help push the bubbles out, but it isn't always easy at first try.
