Beautifully Written
Jeff Carlson's prose is magnificent.  His line by line writing is beautiful.  I am not a huge fan of science fiction, but this story, like his Plague Year novels, is populated by interesting characters and amazing imagery.  The aliens are stunning and original.  So are the people and their technology in the future.
