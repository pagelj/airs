I needed a vacuum that can handle lots of fur and cat litter, since I foster animals for a rescue organization.  Although this vacuum has excellent suction for carpet and through the hose... the suction is dismal when doing hard wood or laminate floors.  It kicks back most of what is on the floor (and yes, the brush is off) and you have to make several passes to suck up cat litter.  I was also surprised at the cheap construction:  the entire casing is a cheap plastic (so cheap, that the first one arrived with a giant crack in the case!).  If this vacuum should ever fall over, it will break for certain!  I was very disappointed, I expected more from this product. I probably should have returned it but I already sent one back for being broken.
