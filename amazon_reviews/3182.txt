Don't bother
I think I will give up the free books. ... don't even know where to begin. I started reading this with high hopes. It sounded like a good read, but it wasn't. I started off liking Brooke and then she turned wimpy! As for the hero, well he's broke and accepts a bet to ruin Brooke and her family? The sisters, well Liberty is fixated on propriety and is an absolute bitch to Mr Grimes, and can't believe that he actually ends up with her in the next instalment. As for Madison, well not much to her but would probably buy her book as found her a bit more bearable than Liberty. The ending threw me a bit and had me confused. Andrew entered into this deal with the Duke of Gateway who turns out to be his half brother? The Duke was a bastard? Is that how it went? Honestly by that stage was so confused, I couldn't be bothered re reading it. Why then didn't Andrew pick up this confession earlier from his mother and use this information to bribe the Duke and get out of this deal he made!! Would have been better than the rubbish that was presented later!
