I've had my Rada sharpener for nearly 20 years and it is the best knife sharpener I've ever owned. Before I bought it, I used to have to ask my husband to sharpen knives and scissors for me on the sharpening block, but no more! I buy the sharpener to give as a gift with a set of the RADA knives. They are FABULOUS!
