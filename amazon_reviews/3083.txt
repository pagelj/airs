very nice pictures, yet still a deal breaker for me
I bought this camera due to the good reviews, and the camera does live up to its reviews.  Nice quality pictures for an amateur like me.  Easy to set up, I took pictures mostly of my dog and my backyard, and they came up really good, both in good light and low light.  So why did I only give it 3 out of 5 starts?  I just can't stand the flash poping out on me whenever it decides to, because that's where my finger is as I'm holding the camera.  More often than not it startles me and I almost dropped the camera once or twice.  It became so annoying that it had to go back.  This is a problem with a lot of cameras which are otherwise very good, and I am very disapointed by the flash location.  My old Panasonic has the built in flash that always shows and doesn't pop up on its own.  I wish I could keep it as I otherwise really liked it.
