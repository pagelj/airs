I have limited room in my kitchen and i had a limited budget when purchasing this dishwasher so because it is smaller and less expensive than a full size i decided to give it a try. It is small enough to fit on my counter but not under my over hanging cupboards but that doesn't bother me. The one rack in the dishwasher is about the size of the bottom rack if a full size dishwasher and i am able to fit allot of dishes in it at once and they come out very clean. The unit has one hose that you connect to your sink that fills the unit and drains. The first unit that arrived had a crack on the back but Amazon replaced it promptly do i am giving this dishwasher and Amazon 5 stars.
