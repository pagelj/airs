Good protection and UV filter
The filter fits perfectly with my Nikon D60 18-55mm lens. And it does its job. My pictures of sky and clouds are very clear without haze. Most of all, I think it is a good investment for your expensive lens. I put it on my Nikon D60 right after I took the camera out of the box for the first time and I keep it on all the time. I have to mention the Amazon customer service. It is unbeatable! When I put my order for the D60, I realize that I should have combined this order with the camera to get free shipping. I called the customer service and they helped me to get a free standard shipping for this order because I just ordered Nikon D60. So this order even came before my D60! (I used super saver shipping for D60, which takes longer time.)
