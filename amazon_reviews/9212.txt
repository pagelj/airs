wouldn't turn on
I decided to give this camera a try. It seemed like a lot of bang for my buck... I got it yesterday, registered the device, and followed the directions to charge and program it. I'm pretty camera savvy, but after reading the reviews for this camera  I didn't want to accidentally ruin my camera because I didn't handle it appropriately. I charged the device for a few minutes and tried to turn it on. This surprised me... no power? I couldn't even tell for sure if the camera was charging. Hopeful, I charged it all night. I tried again this morning, and the device still wouldn't turn on. I tried to call Olympus for customer support, but after waiting for 17 minutes to speak to some one... I gave up. I will be returning this... bummer :(
