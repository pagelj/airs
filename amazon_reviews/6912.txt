It can't get any better
I fell in love with this camera the second it came out of the Box.  I'm an advanced amateur photographer and was looking for something to replace the DSLR while on business trips - usually the times where you kick yourself for not having a good camera with you.  I bought this after trying Fujifilm X-E1 which I still have, but cannot fit in my laptop case.  This camera is with me pretty much whenever I'm out of the house, shoots, RAW, all the settings I need are there and feels great in hand.  I added a Transcend wireless card to it, which made it a really good Pro gear.
