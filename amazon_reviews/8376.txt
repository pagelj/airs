Great short story!
I really enjoyed reading this and I felt the characters were well developed for a short story and that they were very likeable.  It has one brief love scene that was tastefully done. I would recommend this to any romance lover! I do agree that it would have been great as a full novel because the characters are so likeable and the plot has lots of potential.
