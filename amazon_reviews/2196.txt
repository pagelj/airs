Great screen protectors! Amazing customer service!
I just got the iphone 5 last sunday and immediately went to my local walmart to buy screen protectors. i spent $10 on a pack of three. I ended up using all three in a day because they were cheaply made and produced bubbles no matter how clean i made the screen. So i went to amazon and ordered these and spent a little under $6. WOW! This is probably one of the best screen protectors i have ever used!! No bubbles and makes my screen look high def! It fits perfectly. I will definitely buy again from this seller/brand. My sister needs a new screen protector for her 4s and i told her i will order Tech Armor for her because it is the best quality protector i have ever used! all for less that $6! GREAT product, highly recommended. EDIT:These protectors are very great. I unfortunately dropped my phone but fortunately the screen was protected and only the screen protector ripped. I was having some issues and emailed Tech Armor, and they immediately sent me a replacement set absolutely free! They have amazing and quick CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They truly care about the customer. I would definitely do business with them again and recommend them to anyone! Thank you Tech Armor!!
