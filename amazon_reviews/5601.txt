If you like the Canon 50mm F/1.8, you'll love the F/1.4 !!
This has got to be my favorite portrait/low light lens. I first got the 50mm f/1.8 (Nifty Fifty), I loved the bokeh it produced but was annoyed at the cheap build quality, terrible focus ring design, loud and slow auto focus motor. I was told that the 50 F/1.4 would solve my problem if money wasn't an issue. I'm so glad I decided to upgrade because it was definitely worth it. The bokeh that this lens creates is silky smooth, and it's now a even better low light shooter at f/1.4! If you have the money... don't hesitate to get the f/1.4, it will make you look, feel and shoot like a professional compared to the toy-like feel of the f/1.8.
