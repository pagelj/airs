Takes great pictures, is reliable, fast, and waterproof
The shutter speed is great, it takes very good pictures.  I might not be happy if I were a professional photographer, but I'm just a regular person and am very happy.  I got some VERY nice night pictures of fireworks, the moon, and lightning from the top of a mountain on the 4th of July; a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I have the pictures to show for it. The battery life is good, but you'll probably want a second battery as a backup.
