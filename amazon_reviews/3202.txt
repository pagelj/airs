This is the best vacuum cleaner that I have ever owned. Lightweight, easy to maneuver, easy to assemble the handle, excellent cleaning job, close to the walls, and quieter than my last vacuum cleaner which was a Sears Kenmore. The portable canister with a strap provides ease with using the attachments. My order was processed quickly and shipped to me without any problems.
