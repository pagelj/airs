Good machine but if you need repair be ready to wait for a very long time.  After 3 months of use my steam valve started to become stiff and eventually started to leak.  I called Delonghi and got referred to take my machine to a local (thank goodness its local) repair shop.  2+ months later I'm still waiting for the replacement part to come in from Delonghi.  I'm sick of "instant expresso" while I wait and wait and wait for the replacement part. Delonghi does not truly support their products.  When it worked it was a good machine but if I ever get this back, and if it fails again, I'm buying a better product.
