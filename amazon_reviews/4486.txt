Most bang for your buck
I bought the Roku HD for my parents last Christmas and I have used theirs enough to fall in love. I have since purchased the Roku LT for myself and use it everyday. I have even cancelled my basic cable subscription. Using this device with the Android app also allows me to control everything that happens on my television with my phone. Picture quality is great on both regular A/V cables as well as the HDMI. I would recommend this product for anyone and EVERYONE. It allows me to watch Netflix, Crackle, all of my purchased Amazon Instant Video content and much more. Buy this! You won't be disappointed.
