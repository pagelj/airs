I freaking hate carafe. They're clunky, usually ugly and stupid to clean. That's when this little number came to my attention, ridding me of the carafe forever. With that being said, the buttons do appear to be a bit.... wonky. I can't help but feel like a button will get stuck "in" after heavy usage, which is off-putting considering the clams you shell out for this thing. All in all though, it's delivering against my needs and I'm happy.
