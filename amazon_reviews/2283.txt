The mouse worked fine, after I figured out how it worked.
Installation was different than others I have used. It took quite awhile for it to connect to my computer. Also, each time I went to use the mouse, the wheel had to be depressed in order for it to work. This was not mentioned in the very brief instructions. Other than that, it worked very well, although the mouse is small in the hand.
