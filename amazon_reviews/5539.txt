Better than expected
We bought this for use while traveling.  We wanted to be able to watch movies while flying, and also permit my wife to watch a movie after I've fallen asleep in our hotel room without disturbing me.  The unit has allowed both.  We have found the battery lasts longer than advertised so it has performed better than expected!
