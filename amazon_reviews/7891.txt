This machine was perfect, for about 6 months. Yes, it was cleaned monthly. Still, it eventually broke. The milk steamer is the issue. And because it wasn't much (I received it as a gift, it wasn't worth paying the shipping charges to receive a few bucks back. I have informed my non-coffee drinking husband (the purchaser) to spend some $$$ on the next Espresso machine. I hope he has learned his lesson. I hope this helps you avoid this lesson.
