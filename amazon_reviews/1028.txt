This Panasonic vacuum has a ton of power for its size. You will have to empty the container often, but it is incredible easy to do so. The whole cylinder assemble comes apart for cleaning and the filter is washable. It does not have a release button like most and you have to manually kick down the lower section... its a bit of silly design. They do give you a switch to stop the brush from spinning to do hardwood floors... nice. Best for moderate size jobs. Has proven reliable so far with no loss of power.
