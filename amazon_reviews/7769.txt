Bought the toaster for gluten free bread.  We drive to condominiums for vacations and the lightweight toaster can be transported in its sturdy box.  However, the widely spaced wire bread lifters tend to firmly capture the edge of the bread.  The narrow opening to the narrow crumb tray makes removal of broken pieces difficult and time consuming.  When we return home we will try using our plastic tongs.  I posted a picture showing the results of one frustrating experience.
