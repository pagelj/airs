Good bang for the buck!
Love this little lens. I use it for studio work and although at times it might feel a bit too "zoomed in" its a great lens for the amount of money you spend. Definitely one of my best purchases as far as lenses goes (that coming from someone who doesn't have an L yet of course). I doubt I'll ever get rid of this little lens, like I said great bang for the buck.
