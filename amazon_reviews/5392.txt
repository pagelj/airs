Great low light portrait lens
Just got it a few days ago. So far I am happy that it allows me a more open aperture at f/1.4 for low light conditions. I can shoot indoors with a lower ISO and no flash which decreases noise. It creates a much better background blur effect that I could get with a kit zoom lenses with f/3.5 at best on my Canon 60D or Canon Xti. I am still playing with it outdoors to see what effects I can get for portraits etc. But overall I am happy with the construction and quality.
