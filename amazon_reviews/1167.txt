Works great!!!
This was the first time I had fixed a phone screen.  I would recommend not getting discouraged if it looks like you've broken the phone or you dont think it's going to work.  I was positive that my phone wouldn't work because I was using a quite a bit of force and it was kinda difficult to get all the shattered glass off, but somehow it ended up working.  I would recommend using google to look for videos on how to fix your screen and buying this thing since it's a lot more affordable than a lot of other replacement kits.
