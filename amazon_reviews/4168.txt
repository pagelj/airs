I love this product.
I already pay for Netflix, I already pay for Amazon Prime.  This box has both plus a ton of other fun stuff that will play on my "old" HDTV.  I plan to purchase more and put them in rooms that we only watch movies or in seldom used guest bedrooms.  I am sending 2 Cable Boxes back to Verizon and will save 20 bucks a month right there.  These will totally pay for them self in a few months.
