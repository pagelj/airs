Do NOT buy: lens error after 1 week!
I had read the reviews and knew to be very careful with this camera, but it didn't help.  I got the dreaded "Lens Error" after only a week, in the middle of my vacation. I was just getting the hang of all the controls.  It did take nice photos while it worked, and the lens ring is a nice way to do adjustments. No matter, I returned it to Amazon.
