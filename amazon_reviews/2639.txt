GOAL0 14101 LUNA LIGHT
Bought this light to go with us camping along with other goal0 equipment totaling nearly a thousand dollars, first time I plugged it into the extremely expensive equipment it blue the 200$ inverter instantly,(height of camping season in Minnesota) then six weeks later I received another. To the lights credit it works very well with my laptop to bad I couldn't use the other hundreds of dollars worth of goal zero products to charge my laptop!
