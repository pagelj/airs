Great product for the price
This is an awesome product for the price. I recently saw similar product for less at Sam's club, so you may want to check that out. Otherwise, this was $120 less than Walmart and has additional feature of watching two different discs at the same time (majority of products on the market have one DVD player and one 'dummy' monitor - that would be a disaster for my kids as they are about 6 yrs apart in age and don't want to watch the same movies). Picture is great, product is easy to operate and install. The only problem we had with it is that IR headsets are of really poor quality, so we are using regular, wired ones. The other thing is that we don't like is that the headrests are not adjustable.
