Can't beat the price!
Usually you get what you pay for but I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised and pleased with my choice. The suction cup is phenomenal and works on a clean (as well as dirty) windshield. The arm is very tight and I suggest bending it into place before putting it on the glass. Just to be on the safe side - it would stink to break the arm unintentionally. There are little "feet" that hold the bottom of your phone. I use this holder for my HTC Inspire 4G and it works perfectly! I have gel cases as well as an Otterbox and my phone can still be placed in and taken out of the holder with great ease! I highly recommend the "Universal Car Mount Holder" for anyone looking for a cheap yet durable alternative to the higher priced items on the market.
