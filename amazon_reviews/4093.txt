Protects front and back of the PS Vita
This a good bung for your buck. It comes with front and rear protector which has 3 pieces for each. The installation was easy. I followed the Hori installation off youtube, although improvised a lil' bit because the portion of the protector does not have that sticky layer on top to guide when you are ready to appy it. What I did was, I place 2 strips of tape on the top front of the screen guard. This will help you guide/line up the screen guard when you're applying it. The product does what it suppose to do, protect your screen and rear touchpad.
