Surprisingly good for the price
Having had a number of disappointing results from disposable film cameras, I was not expecting this 'basic' digital camera to be much better ... however using it in Maui to photograph turtles and other spectacular marine life, I was delighted with the clarity.  The white balance was adjusted with iPhoto but the photos were great!
