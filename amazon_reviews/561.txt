Stitching on Straps Came Loose After 3 Months
I loved my last Targus backpack, so this one is a huge disappointment to me.  I purchased it on March 28th and the straps were literally coming off in late June.  I am sure that I am tough on items, but I was no more rough on the last Targus backpack I owned and it lasted for 5 years. I approached Targus for a warranty replacement, but they won't send it until I ship this one back to them (at my cost).  If this one is such junk why would I sink even more money into shipping it back for a replacement that'll last 3 months? I'd avoid Targus backpacks, unless you want to have to get a replacement every few months.
