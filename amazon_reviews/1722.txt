Knife characteristics are a preference
This knife is sharp, rocks well, and chops and dices perfectly. I bought it based on America Test Kitchen's review and recommendation.  My two complaints, which are really just personal preferences, are: it is very light weight and too long for me. I prefer a heavier weighted chef knife. I knew the length when I bought it but didn't realize my awkwardness with this 8 inch blade. I'm not professional by any means, and good knife skills need a lot more practice.  For a beginner or non-professional home cook lacking in knife skills, I would recommend shopping in a store before buying and feeling the weight of different knives and judging what length knife is best for you.
