Not bad, but on our 2nd set
We took these on a road trip from CA to OR this past April.  Loved that we had one in the front seat with our daughter and the other in the 3rd row with our sons.  No cables to connect the two units and they can view movies independent of each other.  Sound quality was good and they strapped easily to the headrests. LOVED the remote control feature, came with two remotes, one for each screen.  They worked fine until we ran over a large bump that shook one unit. After that it wouldn't read or play the DVD.  We returned it to Amazon upon our arriving back home  and they replaced it without any problems.  My husband made sure both units worked when the replacements came and they're sitting in the box until the next long trip.  For what we paid I was happy especially since we weren't looking to keep the units in the car full time.  Should they have stood up to more bumps considering they're designed for travel? YES.  But the return was easy and we got a brand new unit to replace so we're happy.  If on the next trip it happens again, then I would drop down to 3 stars.
