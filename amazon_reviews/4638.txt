I like it
I got a great deal on this unit.  I have had it for 5 months and used it quite a bit with no problems at all. good:- big 8 inch screen- pretty easy to use- battery lasts 2.5-3 hours- sound is good for such small speakersnot as good:- screen isn't great - less resolution than my laptop and contrast is just ok.  However I think this is typical on these low cost units- battery dies if you leave it off and in a bag for a couple of weeks. I bought it for well under $100 on sale so I am very pleased with the purchase.
