Could Have Been So Much More...
SPOILER ALERTI started reading it and was instantly pulled in.  However, I knew the author was an Indie, and I expected errors.  I was not disappointed in this.  There were quite a few spelling and grammatical errors--but not quite as many as many other Indies (I did not spend more time mentally correcting the story as I did reading it).  She also tended to bounce around with POV occasionally.  There were a few places where it was so bad, I had to backtrack to attempt to figure out who was thinking about whom.  She also had people boarding the wrong ship name at one point.  As another reviewer already pointed out, she kept misusing the verb "laid."  I also do not care if "alright" has been added to the dictionary as slang, it still is not a word.  Write out "all right."What really killed this story for me (that had kept me reading page after page in spite of all the usual Indie errors right up to the end) was the ending.  There was no closure.  ZERO.  This is all a set up for the next novel--and since this is a trilogy, I expect the second novel will do the same--force you to buy the next novel.  If her successive novels were priced appropriately, say $2.99 or less ($1.99 would be optimum with all the errors), I could see continuing the set.  But at a walloping $3.99 for each of the next two books ($15+ each if you want the paperbacks) to continue on with yet another teaser before getting to the end (and from the reviews, it seems the grandiose ending sucks) I will take a pass. My recommendation is to skip this first freebie.  It will just leave you hanging, and is not worth shelling out the money she wants for the rest of her error-filled prose. If, however, she drops her prices on the subsequent novels to something more affordable considering the errors, then by all means, give it a whirl.  She did spin a good yarn--up to the point where she quit writing and expected the reader to run out to buy the next volume.
