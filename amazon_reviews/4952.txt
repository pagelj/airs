I LOVE my new GE Power Pro X500 Digital Camera!
I was shopping for a new camera because my camera broke when I went to my niece's graduation - it was dissappointing because I wasn't able to get a single picture of her on this landmark day.  I use my camera a lot but it was a basic camera.  After shopping around and looking for something affordable, I found this camera on Amazon and it appeared to be much better than the one I was replacing.  It did not dissappoint!  I read all of the reviews and they were right on target.  I had paid more for the one I had but the pictures are much better on with this camera and this camera has so much more. I am still learning how to use some of the features but I am impressed so far. The only downside that I found was that there is a setting for fireworks that I used on the 4th of July and those pictures did not come out.  I am not a professional photographer and it could very well be that I was doing something wrong but I found the auto setting seemed to catch the fireworks much better.  With that being said, I am still very happy with my purchase and will keep practicing until I figure it out.
