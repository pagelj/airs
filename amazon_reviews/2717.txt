Very Cool
I just installed this and put my knives on, so I guess I'm not quite the expert. It was very easy to install and seems very sturdy. Before I put my knives on, I really pulled on it and it wouldn't budge. I put a longer screw into a stud on one side, and the other side just has the screw it came with. I was able to fit an 8-inch chef's knife, 10 1/2-inch bread knife, 7-inch santoku knife, cheese knife, my sharpening steel, and my kitchen scissors. I'm ordering another one right now because I have a strong urge to hang all my utensils up!
