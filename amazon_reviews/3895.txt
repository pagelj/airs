Impressively fast!
I'm using this memory card in my goPro camera hero3 and it is terrific!! It improves the experience even for the goPro app to see the stream through wi-fi... I believe this is because the elapsed time for saving the data into the memory card has decreased significantly, so the streaming can use more of the camera processor... Anyways.. . not sure if that's the case, but I can see a lot of differences in the overall camera performance! Plus, Amazon delivery was flawless as usual... good prices and good products!
