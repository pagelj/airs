First time I used it, LCD screen fogged and was useless
I bought this camera specifically for a recent vacation as I knew I would be doing some snorkeling.  As I didn't want the hassle of a point and shoot disposable, but don't go snokeling very often,  I wanted something digital, midprice and reliable and chose Nikon as a leading brand.  When the camera arrived, I was surprised at how heavy it was and quite chunky, but it seemed sturdy and as it is also meant to be shockproof, seemed fine.  I inserted batteries and an SD card and was up and running. The camera menu interface is straightforward and easy to use and it didn't take me long to find the "underwater photo" setting.  I took a few snaps around a pool and everything seemed fine.  However, as soon as I started to use the camera actually underwater, the LCD screen appeared to fog up, as if water had got into it and it became totally unusable.  I persevered and took several more photos despite being unable to aim properly.  The camera claims to be waterproof down to 3m, so about 10 feet - I don't think I even went deeper than 5 or 6 feet, so it certainly wasn't anything to do with the water pressureOnce I got back to my hotel room, I opened up the watertight battery compartment and was pleased to see that both the batteries and the SD card seemed dry and unaffected - it was just the LCD screen that was now showing just a white screen with glimpses of the actual image.  Over several days the LCD screen seemed to "dry out" and return to almost normal view, but now some fo the menu buttons don't work.  Also the actual pictures taken by the camera underwater and video were OK, but nothing special - can't quite work out if that is the camera quality or the water visibility which was a bit cloudy, or a bit of both. Overall experience very poor and I returned the camera to Amazon - return was picked up quickly by UPS and full refund issued within three days - if only the camera had performed as well as Amazon
