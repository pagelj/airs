Endless entertainment from an early age
My daughter started holding this phone up to her ear at about 10 months old... she loves that Scout talks to her and that it rings. Let's be honest, almost all of us use cell phones... and our children are going to mimic our behavior... so why not give them a safe alternative than handing them your smartphone and risk them having the in close proximity to the radiation (low or high, shouldn't matter) while they play... and they will not ruin your phone!
