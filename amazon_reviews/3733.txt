So I originally wrote a review on this product because I was having a problem. The carafe had started to leak and it was quite annoying. After taking it apart and putting it back together, it was still leaking. I contacted the company via email. Within 20 minutes I had received a response. The warranty is for 2 years! They said if I continued to experience the problem, fill out a claim form on their website and they'd take care of it. I decided to try once more to take the carafe apart and see if I could figure out the problem. I took it apart, inspected the gasket and glass container. No cracks or visible wear. I put it back together and tightened it much more than I had the first time. Thankfully, it no longer leaks! And I am very impressed with the company's response to my concern. I'd recommend this coffee maker with no reservations.
