Player 'Is Failed'
I would give this thing 0 stars if I could. The first player was DOA. The replacement came but the HDMI out would not work. The only way it would work was with the supplied cable. The menus were shaking on screen and the remote took a long time to respond to button pressing. The stupid player even shut off on its own several times. I thought an update might take care of the issues, but after 10 minutes waiting, the player popped up with a message showing "update is failed". I don't think I would trust another LG product after this fiasco. Guess I'll go with the Sony and try my luck there. This garbage should be yanked from the shelf.
