Great Knives, Terrible bag
I purchased this knife set with the assumption that there would be more than a few spots to put knives in it. unfortunately when it came i found it only had room for the three knives and the honing rod and specifically for those knives. With that the slots that were designed for the knives started to wear out after a few short days. the knives on the other hand are made from great steel, they feel great in my hand and can hold an edge. with all this being said I would recommend this product, not for the bag but for the knives. It's a steal for these knives at this price! just know that you'll need another bag to carry them in.
