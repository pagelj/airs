The Be All End All of Photography Books
I love this book and its very practical and straightforward approach to photography and I carry it alongside my journal now when I travel because its become that indispensable.  Last year I took some classes at a community college for digital photography and found myself swamped with technical notes which confused me more than anything.  However, with Scott Kelby's book he has a great approach to how he teaches he categorizes scenarios and tells you exactly how to set your camera in that situation.  His reasoning is that if you do the correct adjustments enough then you'll learn by experience on what to do in future similar scenarios.  Quite honestly for someone who enjoys taking photographs that's how I want to go about it and not feel like I have to figure a Calculus formula to snap a shot of a gazelle or something.
