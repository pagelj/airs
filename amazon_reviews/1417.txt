Cant beat the price
For under 10 bucks, it's well made, and does what it's suppose to do.  A much better deal and quality than what you can get at your local big box store.  I needed a longer cable than 6ft for my 2nd monitor in order to freely swivel in the monitor arm, and this cable was perfect.
