Coby Portable Tablet
We purchased this product for our 2 year old daughter.  For the price it is ok, it's not outstanding and it's not bad.  The video quality is really good and the sound isn't bad either. You need to pull the player from the poor quality case every time you want to swap a DVD (I knew this ahead of time but didn't realize how annoying it would be).  After less then a month the straps on the case broke off.  The DVD player doesn't save your spot so you need to start from the beginning every time you stop the DVD or get out of the car.  This is pretty annoying if you are making several shorter trips.  For longer trips the player would probably be pretty good but for around town driving it really is a bit of a pain.  I will make due with it but wouldn't purchase it again.
