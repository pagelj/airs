Great from the very first page!
This was so good from the very first page... I was hooked! The Arthur has now become one of my favorites. I have started the sequel "An Heir of Deception" that was a sample in the back. I will be purchasing it and the others that will follow. I love sequels. You feel like you know them and are apart of their lives.  A++++ Arthur and a wonderful book I will read again and again!
