I feel like I got ripped off completely!!!!!
I bought the TEM500 Egg and Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher for my wife for Christmas. She used the thing maybe 6 or 7 times before the thing completely BROKE!!! I can't even toast a piece of bread with the thing!! I'm very disappointed. I'd like my money back, but it's not worth the fighting and red tape involved.
