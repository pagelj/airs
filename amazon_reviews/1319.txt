Good but some problems with it
This is going to replace cable one day. Since 4 months. But If i stream too much it freezes on me. and it also heats up and slows down at times. Apparently the memory chip leaks. l you can fix it by restarting it. other than that its a great productI upgraded to the Roku 2 XD and its worth it. its 50% faster processor and can play games as well. I hope they fixed this on the roku 3 ( memory leak)than that its a great product Recommended! If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
