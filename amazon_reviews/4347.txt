I got the Hoover S2220 to clean my kitchen floor and bathrooms.  None are carpeted and this vacuum does the job.  I did not purchase the vacuum for carpeting just for bare floors.  It works great and I can't believe how much dirt is in the filter system after doing the floors. It would be PERFECT except for the short cord.  That is why it got a 4 star rating by me. I would buy it again because it does a fantastic job.
