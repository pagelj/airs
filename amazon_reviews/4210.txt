I liked this book.
i loved it! i breezed over some of the odd ends like fish names i didnt know but the describing of the colorful sea life was very good. i see jules verne as an idol and keep him in mind when i write my fanfics. about a month after i read it i used it as an anology for science and no one really understood it.
