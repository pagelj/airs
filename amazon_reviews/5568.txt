Works great!
I bought this card from a competing website, to use with my Canon T2i. The card itself works fine although I don't really see a difference in speed between this card and my Sandisk Ultra. I'm assuming this is a problem with the camera not being able to make use of the increased write speed. I used both cards to take pics in 'Raw + JPEG' on Continuous mode. For both cards, the camera hesitated after taking 4 pics. After like 6 pictures taken continuously, the camera would show a 'Busy' while it wrote all pics from the camera buffer to the memory card. I expected that the camera would take less time here, on the Extreme than the Ultra but it didn't work that way. Both times, it took like 3 seconds for me to get control of my camera again. I'm sure this review is not helpful to most people but if you have a T2i and are looking for a memory card, this one seems like overkill. I will update later if I notice any changes.
