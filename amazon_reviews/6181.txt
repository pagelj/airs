A very good case for a mediocre product
I owned the Kindle Fire HD 7" for just over a day.  My experiences with that device are in another review, but I can say I was far less than impressed.  However, if you do have or are still considering getting a Kindle Fire HD 7", I would definitely suggest this case.  It was sturdy, tough, stylish, and fit the Kindle like a glove.  I replaced my Kindle Fire HD 7" with a Samsung Tab 2 7.0, but no case I have seen rivals this.  I truly wish Amazon had not so sorely ruined the implementation of the Kindle operating system so I could enjoy their amazing hardware and this fine case.  I would give it five stars except that it is solely for a product that I could not stand.
