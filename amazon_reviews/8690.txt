I love this cleaner. I started doing my floors because my baby recently started to crawl. I am a pretty lazy person and I have pulled my cleaner out five times in the last month that I have had it. I have already reccomended it to all my friends and family. It is so much cheaper than paying someone and after a few times of using it you will have paid the difference of renting a machine.
