very cute but fell apart in a few weeks :(
I loved the look fo this bag.  I should say it is NOT tweed, but I was ok with that. It is very cute and I loved the style. I got tons of compliments while I had the bag. It is just the right size for me, I prefer something smaller than the trend of the huge oversized bags.  The problem was that the handle fell apart within two weeks of normal use.  This purse is unfortunately very cheaply made!
