excellent
i have toasted bagels and toast. everything turned out good. at first it was confusing because of the settings, but then it becomes easier as you get used to it. advice, the toaster will arrive with a sticker on the front. i cut the sticker so that just the label part is left and placed it back on the toaster, that way you will remember which button is for what. (as you can see, the buttons are not labeled). sooo, dont throw away the sticker!
