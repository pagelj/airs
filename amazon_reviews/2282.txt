Perfect for me!
Love my Chromebook! It is perfect for what I use it for - internet and email. If you're looking for a full functional laptop with all the capabilities then spend the money on one! This little powerhouse powers up instantly when you open the cover, is password protected but my kids can browse on it as a guest. Pages load instantly. It holds a charge for a good 8 hours and charges quickly. I always been a fan of Chrome and I love the size and portability of it. Updates automatically and virus-free, Keyboard is great, mousepad works great. I did get a wireless mouse for when I'll be doing a lot of scrolling and clicking. Haven't looked into tying it into my wireless printer yet but there's a built in tutorial I"ll get to one day. I just use the PC when I want to print something. For the nay sayers out there - I say make sure you understand what you're buying and at this price it's a bargain!
