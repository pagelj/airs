Broken zipper after 2 weeks
I really like this backpack and it had very good reviews.  It was slim and what I was looking for to carry my laptop and some files.  After only about 2 weeks of use the zipper broke.  It's hard to explain properly but everyone has seen it happen - where the teeth don't connect and it doesn't close not matter which way you slide the zipper.  I believe there were other reviews about a bad zipper.  Mine is getting returned... almost makes me wonder if they just fix them and ship them back out.  Oh well.. now I'm looking for a new one again.
