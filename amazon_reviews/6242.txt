Love this Camera
I love this camera. The picture quality is amazing and you can't beat the 30x zoom! My only complaint is the battery life. It's not that long, but I'm going to order a back up battery so I'll always have one charged. Other than that, I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this camera to anyone.
