Extremely Sharp, good balance, and good handles
These knives are very good. They make short work of fruits, veggies, and meats. Heck I have even used the Japanese cleaver in a few home craft projects. I had them almost a year now and they are still sharp as the first day that I received them. I shouldn't need another set for at least a decade.
