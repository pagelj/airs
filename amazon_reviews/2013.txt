Outstanding lens!
I've only had this lens for 2 weeks but the photo's I've shot are beautiful, even when magnified. I own the D5100 and although I love the camera I found that I was using it less and less for the reason of either having to lug around extra lenses or never picking the right one to take. Now with this lens I use the camera all the time. It' like a point and shoot in the way that your ready for any kind of photo. It's very well made with a metal mount and for what it does the weight is acceptable. Without this lens my D5100 would have sat in my closet collecting dust!
