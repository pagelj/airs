FIRE HAZARD! but Black and Decker replaced it.
Have had this for about 8 months.  This item should be RECALLED.  The toaster knob does not shut the oven off, and I have to unplug it after I use it.  It can burn a house down.  I am not the only one that has this problem.  Please read the reviews and DO NOT BUY this oven! After writing this review, called B & D.  They replaced it with no questions, and I sent the defective one back.  They have fixed the timer, so I will now give it 5 stars.  It works well.
