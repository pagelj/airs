Fails in comparison to the book.
Taken by itself, this isn't too bad as science fiction movies go. But it is far inferior to the book by Balmer and Wylie. (To be fair, of course, few films measure up to the books on which they're based). However, it also does not attain the status of true classic that belongs to other sci-fi films of the era such as "Forbidden Planet" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still".
