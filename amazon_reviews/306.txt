Great tote!
I ordered the teal blue and was not disappointed. The color is great and I have wallet that matches it perfectly. The leather is sturdy yet supple, and I like the brass feet on the bottom so it doesn't wear out. Inside is roomy with lots of compartments to fit everything. I can carry it over the shoulder or attached the shoulder strap that is included inside. I have another tote bag from a similiar company, a deep red that is constructed about the same as this one, and I really like that one as well.
