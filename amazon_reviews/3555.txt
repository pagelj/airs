Awesome price to value
Side by side comparisons made this the best price to value camera available for people that want auto everything. Lots of directions and some are written in jargon that make it difficult to understand if you are new to photography. The video options and quality are great, and had no problem creating videos, however I did need a ripper app to make it iPad compatible. The sport scene was my most anticipated feature, but indoors, you cannot use the flash with it, and some of the pics came out blurry. I am still trying to figure out all of the settings and features, but all in all I am very happy with this camera. I especially like the user setting that I configured for black and white, which are super clear.  If you want fast speeds you do need to invest in the scxd card for speed writing, but that added an additional 150 to my price tag. Totally worth it. In auto mode, you can take pics quickly with virtually no thought required. Battery life is acceptable, I got about 100 pics and 10 videos of approx 4 mins each off of 1 charge, and since I am new to cameras in general, I am always reviewing the pics. I rate this high because I am very happy with it, but I do not have alot of experience with other products to say where it is better or worse than another.
