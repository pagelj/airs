Learning curve
This is a five star camera if you take the time to learn how to use it properly. If you just leave it on "auto," it will still take high quality still, distance, and daylight photos. However, to really get that same quality from moving targets and in low light, you must learn how to use the settings. It takes some time if you are not familiar with photography terms. Just the manual alone was not enough for me, as it assumed some knowledge that I didn't have. After taking the time to learn some basics I had a better understanding and the manual made more sense. Once you start to delve into the options and settings on this camera, it's great. There is a combination of settings for every situation, you just have to learn what they are.
