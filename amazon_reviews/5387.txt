Falling Into You
I put off getting this book for a long time.  I finally got it and I am so glad that I did!!  I couldnt stop reading the book once I got started.  I loved Kyle and Nells relationship and was beyond crushed when he died.  I really thought that the author did a great job of making the reader feel her pain and the unthinkable loss of losing Kyle, especially the way that it happened. The one thing that I did not like about the book was how quickly she felt a connection to Colton.  She said that she felt guilty, but it just felt wrong to me that at his funeral that she felt a connection to Colton.  That was the only part that i didnt think that I could feel her pain.  It just didnt seem real that she could suffer a loss and still feel a connection with someone else so quickly, especially his brother. I also wasnt a huge fan of is the lack of details of their parents reaction to them being together.  And while you can assume that they stay together and grow old together, the book dosent say that.  I would have much rather had them get engaged or soemthing. I however am a sucker for very vivid sex scenes and this book has them!!!!!  I was blown away by how intense and real they were. I also enjoyed all of the music references in the book.  It has been fun now that I am done with the book to go back and listen to their soundtrack.  It gave me a new appreciation for those songs and what they mean. i am very pleased with this book, so much so that I think that I am going to reread it!!!!!!!
