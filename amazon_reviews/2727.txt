The Very Definition of Cheap, Badly Made, Disposable Technology
Yes, this toaster oven is astonishingly affordable. But it will still seem like you wasted your money just weeks after you bought it. As anyone who peruses my other Amazon reviews will note, I almost never take the time to write negative reviews. Life is too short. But this device is so badly made, I would be irresponsible not to share my experience. I have a friend who's a firefighter in Tucson, who surprised me once by telling me that toaster ovens are one of the leading sources of home fires.  He must have had a model like this in mind. The timing dial is nearly impossible to turn off, making it easy to leave the oven on by accident. Altogether, this oven is built more like an inexpensive power tool than a kitchen appliance.  Bread toasts unevenly, little fires (from cheese dripping onto the heating element) happen much more frequently than with toaster ovens I've owned in the past, and though we've only had this for a few months, the toasting rack is already bent so that the oven doesn't close correctly.  It's noisy, it's hot, and toast falls off the back of the rack easily, inviting electrocution as you fish around with a tongs to retrieve it. Yes, the "keep warm" setting is nice.  That's about the only thing good about this machine.  It's disposable technology: you'll own it for a couple of months and not even think about buying another Black and Decker toaster oven when it's time to replace it.
