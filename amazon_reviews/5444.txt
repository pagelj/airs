MY FAVORITE BATTERIES
eneloop is by far the best rechargable batteries I have purchased in ten years.  I keep an arsenal of 16 AA's and 16 AAA's on hand regularly. They last a long time even in my high draining cameras. They may just be batteries but when you are out power you feel the pain. Keep the power you deserve on hand all the time. Bravo eneloop!
