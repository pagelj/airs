Phone went crazy after 25 days
I bought this phone 25 five days ago. It looked a good phone at the beginning, everything worked as expected. The only drawback at the time was the battery life. You have to be charging the phone every single day. Then suddenly the phone started to make a weird thing. It detected like if I were plugging in the charger cable showing the battery icon in the top right as if the phone were charging then 3 seconds later the phone said the cable was disconnected. Weird! At the first day of this weird behavior the phone did it like two times at the day. But then next day it went crazy, it had the same behavior but now the phone displayed it was plugged to the charger and then 1 second later it was not and it did it until I turn it off. I tried by removing the battery and give it the phone a rest like 15 minutes, then I put the battery back and turned it on again. It looked like the issue went away but one hour later guess what. It started again. So GOOD BYE, nice to meet you worst phone ever. I am returning it to Amazon. Although it was fulfilled by amazon the phone was sold by a third party, so check that first.
