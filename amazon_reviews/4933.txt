Works great with a Blackberry Bold
This 8GB card works great with a Blackberry Bold, as long as you set it up correctly - while you can format and fill it with data on your PC, if you do this first, the BB will need to re-format and erases all data. You must insert in the BB first, format, change settings to save your various data (photos, video, voice notes, files) to the card, and then you can add additional data via USB cable. So far, excellent, and no issues at all. I am sure the card has many other purposes, but I have used it just for my smart phone.
