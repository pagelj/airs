Excellent Audio Cable
This is an excellent audio cable sold by Amazon.  I used it to link the optical connection out of my TV to my stereo.  This allowed a connection with great sound quality.  The packaging was great and easy to open.  The only difficult part of using this cable is getting the small plastic protection pieces off the ends of the fiber optic cable, thus 4 stars instead of 5.
