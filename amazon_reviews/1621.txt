Better then I expected for the price!
I see reviewers complaining about no USB cord.  If you read the box it tells you "USB cable NOT included"..... hello?  Even after purchasing a USB printer cable this machine is decently priced as you get all 3 Print/copy/scan for about 65 bucks total (after USB cable is added).  It was simple to set up and print outs in color or B/W come in SUPER clear!  I think its a smart buy if you want print/copy/scan with no fax.
