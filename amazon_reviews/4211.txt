Buy It!
Looks like virtually everyone likes this HDMI 6' cable and why not?  One has to have been born stupid not to give this a try.  At $2.21 and free S&H compared to $10 to $30 for the same useage cable? Just buy it and you won't be sorry.  It's a steal. Buy several for future use too.  What it does show though is that some manufacturers and retailers think we consumers are crazy and have to be harvested like so many brainless idiots. A wire is a wire and a connector is a connector.  Yes the cable is light weight and might not survive long life if flexed all the time but if you simply need to connect one component to another, this cable is for you.
