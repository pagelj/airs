I'm not used to this but it was OK
I'm not used to this type of story. It is written by a woman who creates men characters with women's motivations. In other words... the guys fight like girls. But looking past that, it was an exciting story and I liked it. It is a little different from what I am used to but I'm glad I bought it and read it.
