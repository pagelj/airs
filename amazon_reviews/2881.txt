It's Ok for a Good Price
I wrote a product only feedback stating that the cable goes in and out (to fix I just wiggle the cable and viola!). A day later, I received an email from eforcity apologizing for the cable, they refunded my purchase which was great! If you need a cheap cable to run a laptop to a TV or monitor this cable will work for you.
