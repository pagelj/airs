First, let me start with why I love this book before I start talking about why I don't love this book. I love the characters. Imagine a race of fun-loving tricksters who are genius in all things, but suck at math. If you believe in honor above all things how would you react to a dishonorable society? Is fate an eerie eventuality, or a strong mathematical possibility? Do you really have any control over anything? This story takes off from the last and doesn't disappoint for most of the story. My major beef is with the conclusion of this story. The plot never really came to an end, it felt more like part 1 of a two part novel. My biggest fear is that the author will drag this on for an eternity.  I would have preferred that the book was twice the length, but one cohesive story. Another reader compared this to the "In Her Name" series.  I actually thought after reading the first book that they would be similar. But, after the second book I can safely say that I no longer feel that way. It takes place about 60 years after the first book, and Joe clearly is a Congie at this point. "In Her Name" is an inner struggle about a human's identity while forced to live in an alien society. So, if you read that series and are afraid that you will be bored by this, I would encourage you to read this series. I have found it quite enjoyable so far.
