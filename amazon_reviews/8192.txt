No Better than the 7.2 Mega Pixel Model
I have been using the Sony DSC-W55 7.2 Mega Pixel Cyber Shot for over a year now, and have been very pleased with it. I wanted to upgrade to something that would provide me with more pixels, and hopefully better pictures. Unfortunately, after testing it I found the quality of the pictures from the two cameras to be nearly indistinguishable. I am returning the camera and sticking with my old one. The three stars may not be fair, though, because my old 7.2 MP camera is priced much higher than this new 12.1 MP camera. I do not understand why. Be aware that the additional megapixels, even for the same model of camera, may not make much of a difference.
