If you need one-- buy this!
I have been in the entertainment business for over 17 years, and I have purchased many items such as this. It is strong, sturdy, totally adjustable to any viewing angle. It is surely tall enough for any application and the legs extend out to create and Very stable foundation. I currently use one for a 24" flatscreen, and it is perfect.. Trust me-- it is worth twice what I paid for it..
