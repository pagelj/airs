Reasonable price for the product
It's easy to install. It came in 3-pack so the first one was more of a practice but the second time, I got it right. For the price, you can't go wrong. Now, as for the quality, I just have it for a week and cannot comment on it for now. My first impression is that it will hold up pretty good unless you abuse it.
