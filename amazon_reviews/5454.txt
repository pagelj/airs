"can weather any season."........ WRONG!!
Weather proof does NOT mean waterproof.  AS soon as I got this product it was very clear that there was no way in *ell these cameras would not get fried in the first rain.  Before mounting 'em outside I first caulked EVERY openintg and seam I could find (get clear caulk so the cams don't look goofy from a distance). The one exception is the sync button, leave that alone.  The first time fog rolled in the cam with the mic allowed humidity to collect on the lens so I caulked the openings for the mic.  once that was done the cams are doing very well in direct rain.  This is a bit of a hassle but well worth the effort so you can mount the cams outside with no worries.
