disappointed
As other reviewers have observed, this equipment is solid and heavy duty.  However, the front panel that mounts to the HDTV was improperly aligned with the rear panel that attaches to the wall.  They were not parallel, misaligned by about an inch.  In other words, if the rear wall panel was mounted perfectly level, the front panel would angle down an inch further on one side than the other. This is clearly a fault in the assembly process at the factory as nothing appeared to be bent or damaged. If a large TV was then mounted on the front panel, depending on the width of the TV, the misalignment would be exaggerated, with one corner of the TV possibly several inches lower than the other.  A crooked mounting job is obviously unacceptable.  The installer would have to eyeball the installation in the hopes of getting the front level by attaching the rear panel at an angle that would take up the misalignment.  I'm a skilled remodeller and I had no interest in attempting to eyeball an installation where it's critical that the HDTV be perfectly level.  In addition the arms are very tight as others have observed and moved only with considerable effort, but I did not have a TV attached to it since I never attempted to mount it.  I returned the unit with all accessory items in the original box, neatly packed, and received a very prompt and full refund.  It may be that I just got a lemon and the others are fine, but I didn't request a replacement unit since this flaw obviously occurred in the factory.  For the money, it was a real solid piece of equipment, but the one I got could not be mounted.
