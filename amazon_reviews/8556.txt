Worked for a month or so, but is totally unreliable.
I was really excited about this product.  We have a 2 year old and infant twins in the same room upstairs (our bedroom is downstairs).  I thought it would be great to have a view on them all in case the 2 year old did something like put a blanket or inappropriate toy in the babies' cribs.  It was great for a while but now it doesn't work and I'm incredibly unsatisfied and just missed the window of opportunity for return.  We have the monitor plus three cameras. My main issues are these:-The battery seems to only last for a very short period of time.  We've had the power go out from storms, and even though the monitor was plugged in the battery died while the power was out.  Consequently, I didn't hear one of the babies crying until they were FREAKING out (had been crying for quite a while).  I cannot use the monitor unplugged for more than about 30 minutes.-The voice activation system doesn't work.  I've woken up many times recently to the sound of a baby crying upstairs and looked at the monitor and it's not on.  What's the use of a monitor, even a VIDEO monitor, if it's basically turned off? In all, this was a complete disappointment and I can't believe how much money I wasted.  I really wish I could return it or get some sort of credit to try a different product.
