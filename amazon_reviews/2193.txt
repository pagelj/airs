An splendid gift for all Halo fans
I had the game since it came out on the Xbox, there are too many things that the game doesn't tell you, and that's when this book comes. It's the prequel to the game, as it tells you all the background information about the story of Halo. This book so far, has been a great pleasure to read. I love this book as much as the game. If you don't have or played the game, it is still a great read. I recommend this to any Science Fiction fan.
