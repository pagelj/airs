Bang For Your Buck!
I picked up this camera specifically for it's high video quality, and it doesn't disappoint. It's also loaded with a ton of fun features, and captures great photos. For the money, this is probably the best camera on the market. I paid $175 or so, and now it's down to the $160's! There are other cameras at this price point, but not with the Canon name and Canon quality!
