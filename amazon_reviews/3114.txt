The Eureka Quick Up Cordless fit my needs well - is lightweight and does a great job sucking up all the dirt. I had charged up the battery continuously for a week after its first use. After a week's charge when I ran it for about 40-45 minutes continuously, it started sputtering and the motor seemed sluggish. Then realized it had depleted battery. I was surprised, but decided not to run it as long the next time. On subsequent uses I haven't had it running continuously and it has worked well for just over a half an hour. I don't like keeping the battery ALWAYS on charge. Like other users I've seen things the size of a pea or larger most of the times don't get sucked in, but it works quite well on the usually found dust, hair around the house. I think it's not the size but weight of the dirt because it sucked up some largish fall leaves tracked in into the house without a problem. I use it mostly on my laminate floor and on smaller area rugs and runners and it does a good job. Won't recommend it without reservations, but it's better than average, hence the four stars.
