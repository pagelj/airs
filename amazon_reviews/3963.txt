I purchased this small maker because I am the only coffee drinker in my home and have only one cup per day.  It was great at first... taste of the coffee was mediocre.  I didn't like the filter included because it left a lot of residue in my cup.  I removed it to use a regular paper filter (I just used a #1 and folded it down).  The cup is also of very poor quality and other coffee mugs will not fit.  When washing it you cannot soak it in water or the liner fills with water and drips out when you are drinking your coffee.  The only way to get it out is to pull the cup apart.  The machine worked for awhile, but after about 30 days it made only 1/2 cup... then less, then not at all... regardless of how much water I put in.  And the company (regardless of all the complaints on this machine) will not back it up.  I noticed they have since removed this item from stores, so I'm sure they are just selling these to get them off the shelves. I wouldn't waste my money.  After this machine I purchased the Hamilton Beach Brew station and I am VERY pleased!!!
