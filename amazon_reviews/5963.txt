This purse is pretty awesome
This purse was actually pretty cool and yes, the picture does present to you the real size. The lining on the inside is pretty thin, however, but it feels like a decently sturdy purse. I got it in black and it it fits my lifestyle really well. The body strap does take a little working to get going, but I was able to manage. It's got a million pockets and it keeps my stuff pretty organized. Especially the inside pocket with the zipper. I'm able to hide lady products in there like makeup and whatnot. I would give the purse a good Febreezin' though before taking it out as soon as you get it, however.
