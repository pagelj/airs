Done With Dragons
I have had this book for many months and simply cannot finish it.  I used to make it a point of honor to finish every book that I started and this one is more than I can do.  The first three books were great, hooked me on the story lines and characters and made me glad there was more to come.  I found the 4th (which I was able to just barely finish) and now this 5th in the series to be very disappointing. To call this author "The American Tolkien" is undeserved.  Both series are weighty, complex and deep, but Martin's has become simply shallow, repetitious, disjointed and boring.  It's a shame really because it started out with such promise. I don't believe it will stand the test of time like "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" have done. I have enjoyed the first book's HBO adaption and am looking forward to next season.  However, just like with the books, I find I skim over (fast forward) the sex scenes which have become soft porn and frankly, boring. I won't buy the subsequent books (if they are ever published) hot off the presses like I have previously until I know they are worth the read.
