Fun start to an engaging trilogy
Fun. With two already published sequels to look forward to. One previous reviewer called the romance tame; well, admittedly PG-13 side of things with no explicit sex scenes. But fast paced, good characters, funny moments and I was wanting a lighthearted read (particularly over some of the very violent and/or explicit urban fantasies flooding all the bookshelves lately). Goodreads and Amazon book descriptions accurate so I'm not going to summarize the plot or characters.
