I bought this for my 22 year old son, who sleeps until the last possible minute and flies out the door for work - telling me he doesn't have time for breakfast.  This egg & muffin toaster is awesome.  He loads his muffin in the toaster slots, cracks his egg in the little fry pan, and lays a pre-cooked piece of sausage or canadian bacon in the warmer tray.  The settings on toaster will not start cooking the toast/muffin until the egg is almost finished cooking.  Everything cooks while my son is getting ready for work.  All he has to do is assembly his breakfast sandwich and hit the road.  I HIGHLY recommend this Egg and Muffin Toaster.
