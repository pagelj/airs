Buy this, don't waste your money on another toaster oven!
This is the fourth different toaster oven I've had experience with.  The last one, which was almost $200 from Amazon, lasted 3 years. This previous brand failed because the electronics were on the bottom, below the oven, where grease and cleaning products could destroy the mechanism. Breville designed the BOV800XL so using it, and cleaning it, won't destroy it. As a toaster and convection oven, it is very even in toasting and baking quick breads.  Roasting a tri-tip in it right now. Controls are great. All in all, the best toaster and convection oven ever.  And they get used every day around here.
