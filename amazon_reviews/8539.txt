Not Good For Kids, Poor Animation, Moronic Storyline
Very disappointing waste of money. Disney should be ashamed for putting this out. This movie is BAD FOR KIDS unless you think it is a good idea for your kids to learn arguing, emotional instability, intolerance, name-calling, and dependence. The animation is beyond poor. A grade school art class could knock this production out in an afternoon. Please do your children and yourself a favor and do not buy this poor piece of mental self-gratification and garbage. If you plan on parking them in front of a TV, why not at least give them a shot at being somewhat productive memebers of society by letting them watch anything from LeapFrog - ABC's, Word Factory, etc. This movie is terrible and will harm your kids.
