I got hooked again after such a long time!
Due to my busy work schedule, I normally just read 1 to 2 chapters of a book everyday. It's been a long time since I got hooked. I guess it's because the story is compelling and Kira's character is very interesting. This is somehow a novel about terrorism but if you are a Ludlum fun, don't expect too much because this is not hardcore. I love the storytelling and the twist of events. I'm not sure if the research on human super intelligence has scientific basis but I also saw a hint of Crichton's style of thorough medical  research in this book. Why a 5 rating? I simply love Kira Miller! She will be one of the most memorable characters in my opinion.
