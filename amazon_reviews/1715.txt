Dead on Arrival...
Purchased at a local retail store.  Mainly because it was cheap and would act as a spare in a bedroom.  Unfortunately, it would not play ANYTHING, multiple DVD's attempted with the error, "Please Insert Disc"; CD's yielded, "Incorrect Disk".  Composite output did not function either.  Returned to seller.  They took back without question.  The clerk stated three had recently been returned and one of those was by his own sister!  Sorry Coby, not a good impression so far.
