Died after1 month
Lasted a month, then stopped working. Still gets power but just buzzes and flashes; computer no longer recognizes it. Tried mounting it on multiple computers, different ports, both USB 2 and 3. Also, the USB cable connector is unreliable; move the drive slightly and it loses the connection. Nice paperweight.
