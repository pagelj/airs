A good memory card.
I bought this for being used in my Nokia 5800XM 32 months ago. I'm the kind of person  that uses the equipment in a heavy basis as a phone, camera, GPS, MP3 player and my window on the net. And this memory works very fine. Never have problems, never loose any file. And I still using it! I paid $18, and I did it because I trust Kingston products. Some people reports problems, but I repeat, never have one... That's what I call a good choice!
