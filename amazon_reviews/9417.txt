Mostly happy
It's a powerful vacuum for sure.  And much much quieter then our Kenmore. Fantastic for upholstery and the car.  I mean really, really fantastic.  And great on carpet.  Its biggest weakness is bare floors -- I think the floor attachment is just too big to maintain a really high level of suction.  It picks up dirt fine, but not things like Cheerios. And with a three-year-old, that's kind of a problem.  I'm guessing another attachment -- the parquet tool or smooth floor tool -- would solve the problem.  But I shouldn't have to pay another $60 to get a $500 vacuum to pick of Cheerios.  If it came with a bare floor attachment, I'd easily give it 5 stars.  As it stands, I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars.
