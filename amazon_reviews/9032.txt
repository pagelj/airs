I love this machine, with quality locally roasted beans it performs excellently. It does brew a better cup if you make the full 8 cups(which is really probably 4 REAL cups). I often brew half that though before class and am still extremely pleased with the quality. I would not hesitate to recommend this machine to anyone who wants a good cup of drip coffee. I own a pour over, french press, and aeropress but still come back to the machine for its ease of use. You do need to use fresh roasted beans to use it to its full potential but this goes without saying for any coffee. I do not think you will be disappointed.
