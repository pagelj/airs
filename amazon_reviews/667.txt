It is a very good product! Poached eggs are just perfect and it takes maximum 10 minutes to make a nice breakfast. The only complain of mine is that the toaster is not that good. Despite that I still like the product very much. If you don't want to spend much time making breakfast before you leave a house in the morning and want something tasty, it is great.
