Everything I hoped for
This cable arrived as promised in two days and works just as expected. The television says 1080p and the quality is great. The build quality seems on par or better than other cheaper cables I have purchased, solid plastic ends that do not feel like they will break even after multiple exchanges. The cable is flexible enough to bend but doesn't feel thin. Highly recommend
