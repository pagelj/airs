Good choice
I purchased this item to give me more options in what I could carry when I go out shooting. I find that adjusting the size of the compartments easy and that when adjusted they hold the lens and camera bodies snugly in place. I have not had the chance to really travel with it jet so I cannot say how it would feel on a long hike or trip but for the short trips I have taken it on I found it to be comfortable to wear. The drawback though is that it's opening is easily accessible to anyone that might be standing behind you, so if you know you will be traveling in an area that has a high pickpocket rate or theft from tourist it might not be the best bag for you.
