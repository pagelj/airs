I bought this Hoover Tempo Upright Vacuum a few years ago to replace a much more pricey Bissel. I decided to give it a try because of so many positive reviews here on Amazon. They were not wrong! How could a vacuum, that costs 1/3 the price of the one I only owned for a total of one year before it, work so much better? I don't know, but it does. First, this is a pet hair magnet. It finds it all, and some I didn't know was there. Second, it's easy to use. On, off, and carpet height, those are the only options. Not a lot to get confused with. Third, it lasts forever. Every time I think it's getting old and I'm going to need a new one, I change the bag to an empty one and it's like brand new again. I've cleaned up some serious messes with this vacuum, stuff I probably should not have tried to use it on, and it just keeps working. I have so much pet hair in the house, I vacuum every day and I have never once even had to replace the belt. Last, the price is so reasonable. It works like vacuums that cost 2 and 3 times as much. The only flaw I can see is it is not the quietest vacuum. Other than that, it's wonderful and I plan to buy another one of these if the one I've had ever does wear out!
