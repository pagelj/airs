I have used this product on my tile and wood laminate floors. It works pretty much as advertised. Don't be expecting to replace your vaccuum cleaner with this unit.  You can pick up some small items (dust and small particles) on a hard floor, but it doesn't compare to the vacuum power of my Kirby vaccuum.  This is really a mopper.  If you use it to mop, you'll be really happy with this product. Packaging /Set up:The set up out of the box was very simple. They had protective, yet minimal packaging which was nice.  Almost all of it was recyclableCleaning:Tile: I find that I have to kind of scrub the grout areas longer than the tile areas.  It gets it very clean, but will leave more moisture in the grout lines for drying. Laminate: I vacuum first, then do a wet scrub of about 7-8 sq feet and immediately go over the same area with the "Dry" mode.  This works very well and goes fast.  My laminate floors are brand new so I am a little paranoid about water damage. I have not tried any other types of detergents in the unit, just the kind it comes with.  I think the one it comes with is required in order to keep the parts lubricated.  I have owned two previous models in the past 7-8 years and I can say this one is much easier to clean after use. I have no problems getting the clean and dirty water bins off to empty/clean. The only problem I have is when I go to put the filter case back together, it is difficult to snap back on. My floors are so clean and smell very nice, overall very happy with this purchase.
