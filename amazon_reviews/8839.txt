Excellent iPhone case!
I love this case! The colour is so bright, and the contrast with the black is so appealing.  I love that the bumper cases protect the screen a bit by creating a ledge. It claims to be rubber but it seems more like a hard plastic. It's not flat on the back and will be loud if it vibrates. No major complaints & overall I love this case!
