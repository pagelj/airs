The best and least expensive.
I have always wanted a French Chef's knife but they are usually so expensive.  Cook's Illustrated recently reviewed chef's knives and I had trouble finding their recommended version.  Then, while searching for Rada knives on Amazon, I found this one.  It is fabulous.  It is so sharp and moves through even hard vegetables like sweet potatoes with ease.  I use the Rada knife sharpener to keep the blade smooth and working at its optimum.  This knife is only around $15 -- what a deal.  It's guaranteed for life and made in the USA.  I've used Rada cutlery handles get discolored in the dishwasher.
