I bought this machine about 2 months ago and I love it it washes my cloths and leave them clean I also have the clothes spinner which rinsed out the water allowing my clothes to dry quicker I'm a waitress so I needed something that will allow to wash my. clothes atr home I rommend this if u have a small child . I can' wash my. clothes at home and the best part I'm saving money.. and trips to the laundry mat...........
