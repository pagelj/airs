Canon e3 error after 3 weeks
After having the camera for 3 weeks and taking good care of it, I got an e3 error. Software problem. Never once dropped it but there was an internal software problem. Just sent it in to be fixed after owning it for 3 weeks. It works for 60 sec before a message comes up saying e3 error and then it shuts off. I've had 4 canon powershot cameras and this is my first time experiencing this type of problem but I trust canon and always come back to it. I always recommend canon over other makers and this is the first time I've had a problem with a canon camera that wasn't self-induced. It should be fine once it's fixed and shipped back to me. Theres a one year warranty and canon's customer service is very helpful. I'll always stick with canon.
