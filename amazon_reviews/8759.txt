Samsung Galaxy S II clear screen protectors
well... not the best... but not the worst either... they fit my samsung galaxy s 2 t-mobile perfectly... only has the cutout for the earpiece, front facing camera is covered... it took me a while to get how to put it on... instructions aren't so helpful... i got it after a minute or two though... and i went through 3 of them but i still wasn't able to place it so that there are no bubbles/dust underneath... but it serves its purpose... i would have given only 3 stars but i gave an extra one for fast shipping.
