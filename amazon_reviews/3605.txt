I Installed it Myself and it Worked!
This looked just like the real thing, save for one or two minor differences such as the front camera opening being slightly bigger. It was a pain in the ass to install, it took me 4 hours almost, as I messed up a few times and had to restart after I put the screen in. I used ifixit. com's instructional video and they walked me right through it. The only thing not included that I needed for the installation was a small flathead screwdriver, but I just used one from a small eyeglass repar kit. Like I said, the screen looked great although it was a long and tedious process. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to take the time to fix their phone and save a little money.
