Great little thing for on the go
Did a bunch of research between this and one other camera out there. It was a toss up, but I'm glad I went with the Powershot. I upgraded from a Gateway digital camera I got in 2000 that literally fell apart in my hands. The Powershot is so much thinner, easier to use and (big surprise here) works with both XP and Windows 7. I've just left the camera on Auto and clicked all over the place, it's smart enough to know if I need more light or where I need the most focus. The only "drawback" was that it didn't come with an SD card... Not even a cheapo tiny generic one. I couldn't test it out to see if it worked right out of the box. But... it works, I love this little thing!
