Wow, these last a long time under heavy use
I bought these to use in C or D battery applications (with a shell) and for my Xbox controller.  I have been impressed.  Normal Eneloops are great and work well, but with these, I get a solid 20-30 hours of use out them (on the Xbox), and they have no trouble powering my higher amp devices in place of C batteries.  That is amazing.  I'll be buying a few more of these.
