I am the only coffee drinker in the house.  I don't consider myself to be some type of gourmet coffee drinker but I do demand consistency.  This is where I feel the B60 shines.  I select the temperature when setting up the machine and only then ,I pop in the coffee brand I want via the K-cup and then select the cup size (among three choices) and hit the button.  It couldn't be simpler or cleaner.  The little pre-measured cups are great.  I average a cost of 62 cents per cup.  Not cheap but way better than the drive through.  And the drive through's are not consistent, at least around here.  So for slightly less than the cost of the machine at work I get a fresh, flavorful cup of coffee brewed the way I like it.  Is that worth $160 to you?  It took me awhile to see the economics of it.  Those economics were the purchase of a $18 single cup coffee maker, then a $24 4 cup maker, and then a standard $29  8 cup maker.  Sure they will make a decent brew but now I have 8 cups and will end up throwing away at least 6 of those.  I will not review a purchase the day I recieve it for (hopefully) obvious reasons.  I have had mine for 30 days and have no regrets.  Not everyone is in the same situation but if you are, I doubt you will regret this purchase.
