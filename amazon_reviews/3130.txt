Exactly as advertised
I have the iPhone 4S as I have had every iPhone every released except the iPhone5 and I take extremely good care of my cell phone... I use Invisable shild to protect the surface.., but from an appearance perspective my "Premium Chrome Aluminum Skin not only makes my iPhone look good it also works very well protecting it from shock of in-intended drops... Great product....
