Wish it had a hand strap...
The cover fits the Kindle Paperwhite perfectly.  It provides a solid cover to protect the Kindle.  It increases the thickness of the Kindle and I also feel a gain in weight.  I would prefer the cover included a strap to ease holding it one-handed. The cover automatically puts the Kindle in sleep mode when closed and wakes it up when opened.  It also turns it on when opened, which appears to be an issue with the Kindle itself.  It makes storing it without worrying about draining the battery if it accidently opens questionable. It is a little tough to remove the Kindle from the case.  It is definitely designed to keep the Kindle safe without regularly removing it.  I still like to take it out occasionally when I feel the difference in the weight holding for long periods.  The Kindle is still easier to hold without the case.
