Good but with flaws
I enjoyed this book and as an "added attraction" it hit close to home as i work on 7th avenue between 25th and 26th street in Manhattan, basically in the same neighborhood as the story.  Having said that the story was good but I agree with some of the other criticisms.  There was a choppiness to the story.  Not a spoiler, but the transition from New York to the actual escape was anti-climatic to say the least.  Again, a good read, worth it (certainly at only $0.99) but I was disappointed by the ending. In short, I will certainly try this author again.  His ideas are original and fresh.  Perhaps a writing class?
