Cute, and seems durable so far
This is such a cute little backpack.  I bought it for my 2 year old.  As others have said, it's too small for a school backpack.  It would only fit really small books.  It seems durable so far, although I've only had it for a few weeks.  The zippers have large honeycomb tags that are easy for toddlers to grip and zip by themselves.  Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.
