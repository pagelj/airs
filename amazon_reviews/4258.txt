Works super fast
I recently bought a Canon T3i and wanted to use it at it at 60FPS for skateboarding. I heard about other cards not being fast enough to film at such a high frame rate. After filming with this card for the last month I can honestly tell you that it's worked perfectly. I'll be filming for 2-4 hours a day and the card will only STOP recording just a handful of times. I bought two of these, I probably need to buy more :) Also when we're filming the card is working over time catching everything while we're moving with the camera skating along the skater vibrating the camera all at the same time. Buy this!!! Muah.
