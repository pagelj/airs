If you can only  have one  telephoto zoom, this is the one!
Problems with Nikon's "customer service". That's why 4 stars instead of 5; it's all part of the package. BUT; the lens itself is sharp, marvelous, and worth the $$$! Don't be put off by people that sneer at "consumer" lenses. Generally, you get what you pay for, and this is not a cheap lens! Sharp, 105-450mm equivalent on a DX sensor camera. It will also work with FX-sensor and film cameras.  11X14 and bigger enlargements from  my 6.1 MP camera are no problem! It has a learning curve, but it is not bad, and I am not a technical person.  The VR system works very well, even at lower shutter speeds, and my percentage of sharp "keepers" has improved greatly. The VR makes a slight mechanical noise when it is working. Focus is fast, with only a slight tendency to "hunt". As with any lens, good technique helps greatly. One thing to be aware of... the VR is powered by the camera's battery, and it uses perhaps 25% more electricity than non-VR lenses. Before VR, I could count on about 400 exposures from a fully-charged battery... with VR, 300 is more like it. No biggie, IMO. This is a BIG lens, heavier than most "consumer" level optics, and can cause neck/back pain, if carried by the universal neck strap, no matter how wide. I switch to an over-the-shoulder "sniper strap" for days at the race track and air shows, and comfort has increased manyfold. Would I like to have Nikon's legendary 70-200mm, VR f/2.8?  O my yes! But, economics being what they are, it is not likely, and the 70-300 fills my needs beautifully.
