Excellent iPad 2
The iPad arrived within the one day shipping by Amazon.  The packing was appropriate for this item.  I find the Apple line of consumer electronics to be very user friendly. The software is intuitive--it does and goes where you would expect it to if you were doing the same process manually. This is my first exposure to the iPad.  I highly recommend it as an addition, or replacement to other computer products.  The screen keyboard takes getting use to. It is a light touch.  I anticipated this, amd so I am using an AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple iPad/iPhone. There was no contact with the seller as this was fulfilled by Amazon, but I would buy from this seller again based on a good product delivered in the described package. Buy an iPad, you will not be disappointed.
