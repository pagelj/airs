Perfect for my uses
This is exactly as the description states, 100ft. of camo paracord. I am using it to try my hand at paracord bracelets and other items. This is also going to be use for a clothes line when I move to Chile. Great product and looks great as a paracord bracelet, I've received compliments on the first one I made.
