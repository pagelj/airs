Great price for a quality monitor!
I've been shopping for a few years for a video monitor, but always found the prices to be more than I wanted to pay. Finally, I found this no-frills monitor closer to my price range. This is a great solution if you don't need a larger screen or the bells and whistles other monitors have. This was very easy to set up. Just plug it in, and you're ready to go, and all the features work automatically (night vision, white noise cancelling). There are a couple items that could be improved (the battery only lasts for a few hours, so it you are going to have it on all night it has to be plugged in, and the cord is short. Sometimes I wish the the audio could be manually turned back on when it shuts off), but for the price, it can't be beat.
