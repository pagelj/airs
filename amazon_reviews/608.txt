Holy cow! WOOL is great!
Actually, imho, "great" is inadequate to describe how good this omnibus is. A friend gave it to me for my birthday. I figured it would be a decent read, because she is an ebook editor. But I was hooked by the end of the first page. It is an incredible, yet totally believable story of life in some future where the outside world is deadly and people live in great silos for their entire lives. I was fascinated by the details of HOW they live, which are well and logically presented through the story. No boring expositions here! The book is well written and the plot had me reading late into the night. The characters are so believable I grieved when they suffered. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
