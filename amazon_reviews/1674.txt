Awesome Camera with just a few caveats
This is an amazing camera for the price, especially for someone getting their first DSLR. I got this camera, because I'm about to have a little girl and I wanted to take better pictures than I could with my Droid. Now that I have it, and have taken some pictures, I want to take more pictures of everything. I see amazing shots all around me everyday now. It does have a little bit of a learning curve to it, if you've never used a DSLR (I think all DSLRs do though). There are only two complaints that I have. The first one is a lack of AEB (automatic exposure bracketing). I've seen some really amazing shots that are HDR (high dynamic range) images. The easiest way to do these kinds of shots is with AEB, but that option is reserved for the higher end Nikons. You can still achieve HDR shots without AEB, but you need to either use the timer to reduce shake, or a remote shutter. Which brings me to my second issue with this camera. The D3100, from my understanding, replaces the D3000. The D3000 has an infrared sensor on the front for using a wireless remote shutter. For some reason Nikon removed the sensor from the D3100. You can still purchase a corded remote, or a wireless remote that comes with a wired sensor, but it would have been nice if Nikon had made it easier to take HDR shots on this camera. If you are aware of these two things, and still purchase the camera, I think you will be happy.
