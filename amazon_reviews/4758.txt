So, it worked for a week or so and then the rotating head brush stopped. Called for service and was told to take it 60 miles to the nearest facility. Called back said I didn't think so. Thus commenced the silly saga in which they have sent me two major components, neither causing the problem and now they're telling me that I really will have to drive the 60+ miles to their service facility to get this essentially out-of-box warranty failure fixed. My suspicion is that this is also a design flaw in how the nozzle (head) attaches to the body of the vacuum. I recommend another brand.
