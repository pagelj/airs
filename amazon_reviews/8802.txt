Misplaced emphasis
Possibly the worst designed product I've purchased in many years. No users manual was supplied except a digital one that requires a Windows product to read. I downloaded a copy from the LG website and found it difficult to read because they selected a grey font for the text. The mini manual they supplied as hardcopy never mention playing disks. It was more concerned with using LG apps off the internet. That worked. When I got the player to work, it recognized a 3D disk, but refused to allow me to select 3D playback. Yes, the TV to which the LG unit was attached was a 3D unit set to playback 3D disks. Since there was no mention in the users manual about the nonfunctional 3D/2D dialog box, I took the time to look in the documentation for the TV. That's where the dialog box was mentioned and it required the TV's remote to set the dialog box to permit 3D playback of the disk. What made everything confusing was the fact that the player remote control had some TV controls, but nothing that would work with the critical dialog box. In other words, the LG player worked, but their documentation was dreadful.
