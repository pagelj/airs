Simple, dependable waffe maker
This replaced an identical model we had that died after 10 years of use.  Inexpensive, lightweight, heats fast, cooks waffles evenly. The only negative is batter overflow can get into the front slider opening and can be difficult to clean out, but other than that, this waffle maker does the job at a great price.
