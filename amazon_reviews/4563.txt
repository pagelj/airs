typical lithium battery
I love the versatility of the charger but the batteries are what we expected. For someone like me who uses the camera every day, several times a day, the batteries have started to die a bit sooner than they did at the beginning. It has been 5 months so buying an extra 3rd battery was a smart move for our family.
