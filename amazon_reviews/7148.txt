Not much of a difference from previous version
I love the Apple TV and the simplicity of it.  Makes streaming and playing podcasts and iTunes music simple.  For less than $100 it is SO worth it. Four stars because clicking Airplay on my Macbook Air and iMac often does not work (or sound does not play).  I checked, double checked, triple checked all settings. My Apple computers are less than two years old each.  After searching a solution, I downloaded AirParrot  (about $10) after reading about others having the same issue, and it works perfectly. So really, total cost is $110  (as you may need to download AirParrot or something similar) - still very worth it.
