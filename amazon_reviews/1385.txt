Great product
I've been really happy with this monitor.  One thing I want everyone looking at monitors to know is that it is very durable. I tried to mount it about seven feet off the floor and my 3M adhesive hook (I'll have to give that a review somewhere) gave out and it crashed to the floor.  I thought for sure I had just kissed a couple hundred bucks goodbye, but no! it was still working!  I now have it sitting on a table next to my son's crib and I've accidentally knocked it on the floor on more than one occasion and it continues to work.  Fell about four feet on to a hardwood floor and did not break.  You can see the babe in the dark and it even plays lullaby music, which surprisingly works sometimes to get my son back to sleep.  There are cheaper and more expensive monitors, but this is a good one
