Good backpack style camera bag
This camera bag is convenient because it is a backpack style.  It may be a bit big for those who want something compact, but most users of the Digital Rebel would have multiple lenses and other equipment.  It comes with lots of straps on the side, and bottom of the bag for tripods and other things.  It makes me feel good carrying an expensive camera like my rebel xti in a backpack style so it frees up my hands and is secure on both my shoulders, not just one.  It is not big enough for my 12" display laptop.  One review said that there was room to put a laptop in there.  Not really and it isn't really padded to allow safe stowing for a laptop.  I like that there are so many compartments.  I can carry papers, books and other items.  For me, I don't use it to capacity.  I have a macro lens and a ring flash for it and there is still plenty of room in it for other things like maybe your lunch.  I like that it doesn't look like a camera bag.
