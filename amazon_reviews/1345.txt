I don't think I have ever written a review before, but I had to speak up this time.  I love this vac. Having two german shepherds that shed constantly makes cleaning never ending. I was looking for a small and light weight vac that I could keep in a small storage area off my kitchen, but would still have power and decent capacity (not a dustbuster with a handle).  The reviews on Amazon sold me on giving the Optima a try. It pulls the fur from two feet away on my tile floor and digs the fur out of my carpet. I have a Kenmore bagged vac that I thought was doing a good job. I was wrong. Even the hose attachment works great.. pulls fur right off my couch. Only minus is the cord is a little short and mid-size capaciy. Perfect size for apartment or 2nd vac. Great for use on stairs because of small head and light weight.
