I like it overall
I've been using this for about a month, & overall I like it. I do very little home computing offline, so this really appealed to me. I don't own any other devices except a basic old Tracphone that suits me fine. Though I still may get a Fire just because, even though I prefer a keyboard. The most recent "patch Tuesday" with around 15 +/- patches came & I could ignore it!! Very cool!! I'm still getting used to the track pad. One major issue I had was with the most recent Chrome update. I forgot my password to login after the reboot(yeah I know I'm a dummy). I reset my password & logged in only to find I had to know my old password to "synch" in order to get all my settings(bookmarks, etc.)!! There is a message saying you need to update your passphrase, but in fact I could not just plug in my new password & bring all my settings forward. The only option I had was to delete everything from Google's servers & start from scratch; ugg!! Now I use Lastpass(product plug!)BTW, to anyone that doesn't know these are web centric devices until they get them; really?!! Didn't you do any research first? I'm not a real smart guy, but I did lots of research(read reviews from professionals online, bought 2 books specifically about Chromebooks;about $ 20.00 investment). If nothing else, the description right here on Amazon tells you it's Web centric. If a dummy like me can figure it out, all you smart guys should be able to!! Great product for me, YMMV.
