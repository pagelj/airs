Solid Product, I would recommend it.
Excellent product.  The mounting was easy.  The whole process took me about 1.5 hours from disconnecting my home theater system, mounting the bracket and then mounting and reconnecting the television.  I was able to do this solo, however I would suggest having a second person available just to hold the bracket against the wall while you bolt it in.  You may want help lifting the television if you feel you are unable to do this alone.  Attaching the TV itself was very simple.  I have a 47" LG LED and it mounted easily with the supplied equipment.
