Wow what a difference in quality! I bought this to replace my well-loved Eureka Easy Clean 2 in 1 vacuum, which looks very much like this in the ads, but comes in 2-tone purple. They both go on sale from time to time, coming in around $30 when they do. But the two-tone purple one is well made, easy to use, high quality and this is not! (Don't mistake the two-tone Easy Clean for the solid purple version of this Quick-Up.) This has a cheap metal pole you have to screw onto the cheap plastic handle and then insert into the body (and this one doesn't retract). This one's cleaning path leaves much more behind at it's edges, making it effectively 8" wide. This one is harder to push back and forth because it's rickety and cheaply made. This one has to be mounted on the wall for it to fit correctly into its charging station (which I can't do in my rented apt) or you have to take the battery out to recharge it every time. The Easy Clean has a regular little square box for a charger that can be plugged in anywhere and you just insert the connector at the other end of the nice long cord into the side of the vacuum, so it's more flexible where you can store it. I'll keep this one and use it because I paid for it, but let me tell you- the other one is much better!! I'd even pay $10 more to get the one that's a pleasure to use every time.
