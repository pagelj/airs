Bang for the Buck
Made in China, adequate for small TV's, limited adjustability, requires tweaking to make TV level.  I guess that's why the bottom screw hole on the mounting bracket is elongated from left to right.  Even if the bracket is perfectly plumb, the TV might not be.  However, this inexpensive item is perfect for my application.
