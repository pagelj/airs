Cheap and Fast memory.  No problem so far.
Works great with Canon 60D.  Read speed 16MB/s.  Write speed 10+MB/s.  1080p video recording was no problem while no-name class 4 card choked in this mode.  To be fair,  my Kingston class 4 is able to do HD recording with no issue. I was hesitating before ordering due to the negative reviews.  I will wait to say anything about the longevity of this card. If this card seems to be slow to you,  double check the method used to calculate read/write speed.  I have one card reader that tops out at 5MB/s so every card performs like a class 2 in it. To reduce the chance of memory card corruption,  here are the DOs and DONTs1. Format the card in the device that you intend to use it in.2. Format the card every time after you copy the content off.3. Don't manually delete images one-by-one unless you absolutely have to.  You are fragmenting the future data and increasing the chance of corruption.4. Keep the battery charged and avoid running the device with little juice left.
