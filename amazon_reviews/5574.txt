I got one of these a few years ago.  Unless they have changed the motor's power I strongly recommend paying another $25-30 for the Eureka cordless model 2 in 1 Easy Clean cleaner. My experience with this model is abysmal.  It has too little suction power for even small pickups such as pieces of cat food and is a nuisance to plug in to a different outlet each time you go to another room.  Sure it converts to a hand vac but you have to lower the handle and pull off the base part which gives you a smaller but better suction input or put on the easily lost crevice tool.  Spend the additional money and you will get a 1000 percent better cleaner with the model 108-A.  Read the review I posted for my 108-A before you buy this one.
