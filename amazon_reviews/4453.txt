I can't believe the quality for the price!
I purchased this at my son's suggestion. He has one he uses for camping. I was going to buy a $150 unit for a preheater for my airplane. That would have been way cheaper than buying an aviation preheater that used the same stove. This works just as well for less than $10 and no shipping with Prime! Had it in two days!
