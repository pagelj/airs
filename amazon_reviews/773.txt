Product Misses The Mark!
It all looks good but after 6 hours of my time and two long calls to Panasonic C. S. They, Panasonic, finally admitted the product WILL NOT work in a wireless envirement and stream audio and video through a home entertainment amp. to a Viera Link and HDMI cable to my Panasonic Plasma flat screen TV.  All my equipment is less than three years old.  Big disappointment and a waste of my time on a day off. Think twice before purchasing this product!  6/18/2012
