Scary but a needed read
I cut out the forward since I believe the person to have written it to be an atheist and as a Christian I didn't want that and I didn't want to lend it to friends with that in there. The stories where scary and told stories of massive oppression. However they should be a lession to us as well of what can happen when certain people are allowed to go power mad and violate your God given basic rights that we all have. When things like The 7 Commandments Of Animalism are changed around,added on to, no matter how small can mean big trouble. We in the US for example need to remember our Consitutional rights and when they are violated we need to speak up and stand out ground of not letting this happen. Even today here in the US there are people in the government that have "pleged" to uphold the Consitution yet when that is done and over with they make up "loop-holes" or try to change around the words when they speak of it to suit they're own selfish needs and take advantage of people. These storys may have been fictional but they are based on the truth of something that can really happen and sadly still happens today in this world (ex. North Korea). We must stand up to defend our God given rights. Don't let this play out in your country if you can stop it at all costs. The earlyer the intervention the better. Hold people accountable and question atthority.
