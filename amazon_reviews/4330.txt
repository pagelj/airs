Trustworthy and Prompt
I have done online shopping on Amazon - 2 laptops, 1 tablet, 2 mobile phones, and some other electronic items. I have found all the purchases to be trustworthy and prompt. However, there was a laptop - Dell that did not work properly, and very promptly I got my full refund back within a short period. I purchased another laptop of HP from amazon. Amazon has not built its credibility and reliability as number one on-line portal just by sharp advertisements and market gimmicks, but in real and practical sense Amazon has worked hard with honesty and diligence to deliver the goods to the customers with satisfaction. And that is why amazon is the best on-line portal that I have found in USA. It was a wonderful and amazing experience for me as I am visiting USA from India as a research scholar, the whole on-line shopping was altogether a new thing for me, and Amazon made me believe that yes, a good shopping experience is possible on-line too.
