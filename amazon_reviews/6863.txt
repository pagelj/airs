This game can be costly
The game is adorable and fun for kids, the two star rating is because children are given the opportunity to purchase items to get farther in the game........ a friend's daughter bought $20 worth of coins/jewels without her mothers knowledge.... when I was informed of this I immediately opened the game and was soon asked if I wanted to purchase items, this is ridiculous, there is an option to buy $100 worth of coins/jewels....... this should not be in a game that is designed for young children and I should not have to check each child's game to see if this scam (that is the best description I could come up with since it takes advantage of kids and a parents wallet) is part of a game. There should be some type of warning when the game is purchased or an option to turn this feature off.
