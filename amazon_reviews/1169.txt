Oh my goddness-gracious-me-oh-my, do not buy this pen if you're expecting to rely on it for defence against anything other than a rabid lawyer!  Someone else warned about the weak threads between the two halves, and they were SO right!  Mine completely failed with hardly any side-pressure against the joint.  Even when I held it firmly in a strike grip, the tip end would roll open partway in my fingers.  This does not promote confidence in a physically violent confrontation!  Do not purchase this pen if you expect to use it for anything other than writing & impressing know-nothings.  I was so excited at its low-profile, and I expected anything better than this from UC... I learned my lesson.  I'll update if UC makes good on replacing it... in all seriousness, solid writing instrument, hardcore failure as a tactical impliment.  Get an Archangel; they're much more solid, the surface is textured for a much more positive grip, and they're non-metal construction means even lower profile IW(Improvised Weapon)for TARFU/FUBAR conditions. Get ANYthing besides this.
