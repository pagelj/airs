Hi,  I never write reviews but when my husband noted the same problem I had wished someone would have written a review about this. When vacuuming on hard wood floors the vents from the motor blows all the dust and bird feathers around the room before you get a chance to vacuum them up. And the cord is to short.  Nowhere in this ad does it say the cord length , I didn't know the length of my last vacuums cord ,  but I guess it was long enough,  This machine is  not.
