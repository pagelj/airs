Perfect for carrying with  a 45-150 lens
I take this almost everywhere I go. This and the 45-150 lens complement each other and the well-designed handgrip makes it easy to carry in one hand while walking.  It is very different from my Canon 60D, which has not been used since I did an initial comparison of the two cameras. When I showed other photographers the images from both, some preferred one camera's image, some the other. This was comparing photos published on the internet. I  wish the EVF was a little brighter, but it is usable and of course the screen is always available.  If you are familiar with some P+S or any DSLR camera it is easy to set up this camera, as the menus are as expected and straightforward. It will make the trip to England with me this summer and the 60D will stay home.  It is lighter, smaller, and of high quality.  It's an excellent camera for the price.  (the kit lens currently resides on an E-P2 body)
