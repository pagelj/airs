Functionally it works
I purchased this charger approximately 6 months ago and I have to say tha tI like this car charger. It charges my devices without a problem. However, I have found that it is loose in the car socket and can be bumped loose. I have a socket in the center console/arm rest so I am able to plug it in and not worry about anyone bumping it but this is definitely an item that you should check out before purchasing. The metal springs on the sides would help make the fit snugger if they were a little larger. As a side note, my Garmin cable plugs in fine and doesn't wiggle, nor do my older car chargers, so I do not believe that the sockets in the car are a problem, so it is the design of the charger that is the culprit.
