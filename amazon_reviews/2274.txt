Definitely recommend this!
I decided to add this to my registry after reading the reviews and I am so glad I did.  I attached this to my bassinet and my daughter (3 weeks old) sleeps perfectly with it.  I use the ocean and rain sounds the most.  I will also use it in the car and when I travel, we have a upcoming trip and I can't imagine leaving home without it.  It is kind of annoying that the longest timer setting is 45 minutes (maybe to save on batteries?)  but I just reset it if she makes a noise or I notice it has turned off.
