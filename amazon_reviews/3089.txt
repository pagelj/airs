Great battery time and reliable DVD player
I purchased this DVD player for a trip to Europe. It worked like a charm. I wanted a player that had very long lasting battery time, and my search ended up with the Panasonic DVD player. The battery that comes with the unit lasts at least 8-9 hours on a full charge, and there are replacement batteries avaialble on Amazon that greatly extend that capacity if you want to purchase an additional battery. All in all I think this is an excellent player. Picture quality is OK, controls are pretty easy to figure out, but battery life is excellent and that was my (personal) main concern.
