I have gone through many vacuum cleaners including a Hoover upright that was rebuilt three times before it finally gave out. After reading reviews about other vacuum brands I decided on the Dyson DC 33 for the suction and the power. I was not disappointed. The suction is amazing and the cat hair that I have to deal with is not a problem for this machine. The on board tools are handy. The noise is not too loud. The suction is powerful. I am very happy with the vacuum that cost more than I wanted to spend on a vacuum but it works and that the most important thing.
