Bought it USED for the Kindle Paperwhite
I bought it used since I would be able to save about ten bucks. It is perfect for the Kindle paperwhite and even came with a cleaning cloth. It is exactly what I needed. If you are unsure how to put this device on, however, you would need to look that up first. My product did not come with directions :)
