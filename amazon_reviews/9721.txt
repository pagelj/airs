Good
I consider myself an amateur photograph, and this is really what i have been looking for. A high end camera but for people on low budget, like me. Pictures are great, sharp, and video is recorded in HD. Really recommend this for all the people that like photographing as much as i do, but just cant afford those professional cameras.
