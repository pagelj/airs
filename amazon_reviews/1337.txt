Great Backpack
This Backpack has worked great with my 15.4 inch Dell XPS. I have used it on a few trips and has worked great. With the laptop in the bag you can fit multiple books in front because the laptop has its own compartment. Lots of compartments is also a nice feature. you cant hardly tell when you have the bag on because the straps fit so nice. Great Bag!!
