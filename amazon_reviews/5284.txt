Great story with bad editing
I thought that the story was great and very interesting but the editing was bad.  Some places you need to read a few times to understand what the writer is trying to say because the grammar is so bad.  I was looking forward to reading more books in this series even with the bad grammar and editing, unfortunately the story focus changes with the following books and isn't as interesting.  The editing gets much worse as well.  The following books get to the point were it feels like you are reading a rough draft that has not even been proof read at all.  I would recommend reading this book and maybe the first and second broadcast books (which come as a pair) but I stopping with the third broadcast because the content and editing got so bad.
