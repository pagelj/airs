Can it get any WORSE????
Absolutely TERRIBLE!! We wait how many years while reading updates about your house remodel. There is no point to the story anymore. George- come on, you have great character development. You can't seem to figure out what to do when you develop them so you kill them. I mean how many chapters have you devoted to characters you have killed? Who is the protagonist now? Some kid who we just learn about in book 5? Really? We have nothing invested in him. Your writing is a mess. I can't believe I wasted twenty bucks and countless hours reading this garbage. This series is done. Don't bother reading the book. If you must wait until the excess hardcovers come to the 99 cent store. I have lost all respect for you as an author George.
