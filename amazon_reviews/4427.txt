If I could only upload the photos to my computer
I bought this camera so I could EASILY upload photos to my computer and Facebook.  I used it over the Thanksgiving holidays and it worked great.  Then I came home and the cable that came with the camera didn't fit the camera, so I purchased another cable specifically for this camera, received it today and SURPRISE it doesn't fit the camera either.  So I tried to upload the photos through the WIFI option and haven't been able to get that to work either.  I'm paying a techie to come to see if he can figure this out.  I'm very frustrated with this camera.  I've only had it a month; but am about ready to trade it back to Amazon for something else that works.  My advice - don't bother.
