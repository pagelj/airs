This is my 2nd iTouchless garbage can and the only reason why I had to buy a 2nd one was because the first one was damaged in a house fire. I've read so many bad reviews but I have to say, my first iTouchless was 10 years old and I NEVER had a problem with it. All I had to do was replace the batteries... This is a great product and I will always have one in my kitchen!
