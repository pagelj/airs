One choice
The idea that people can be divided into such narrow groups is kind of upsetting. None of the factions sound like anything I'd want to be a part of, but that must be part of the point. A good thing about books is that they don't have to be realistic. Tris is likable and Four is close to everything I want a book boy to be. I'm interested to see the movie.
