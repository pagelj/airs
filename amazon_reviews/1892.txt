LOVE IT!
Absolutely love it, its only been a month but it already exceed my expectations for the price! Cons: no hard drives, so no software like Microsoft office or iTunes and with out internet/ WiFi it basically uselessPros: Fast no matter internet speed The chrome book itself is lighter than air and can be brought anywhere and is great for everyday needs. I love it and does just enough not to complicated!
