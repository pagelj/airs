The girlfriend and I love our morning coffee, we are not experts but always buy premium coffee and have usually used a french press for the best flavor. Work days however we would use a coffee maker for the ease and quantity. This is my first thermal carafe and we love it! We have had it about 6 mos and here is a test run done this am. From start to beep 10 minutes. Temp (lid removed, steam blown off, and an IR temp unit) at beep was 178, 30 min l68, 1hr 164. Stopped test here as I'm going to work. No change in flavor that I could detect. In short we love this product! The only drawback is the LED at the bottom to set the time for delayed brew is to small for us. We have to squint, particularly at night, to set it for the next day.
