better than I expected
I purchased it because of the good reviews and I liked the video samples that I found on youtubebut after start recording for the first time at 1080p 60fps, I completely shocked of the high quality of  the recording and the very smooth clear frame rate, much much better quality that I found on youtube, I would give this camera 5 stars just for that! pros:amazing video qualityoptical steady shot feature is better than I expected especially when I or the object move very fastwind cancellation is brilliantcons:if you looking for a vid-cam that capture photos in a high quality look somewhere elsebut this didn't effect me because I wasn't planning to use it for photos even before purchasing it, because I already have a DSLR
