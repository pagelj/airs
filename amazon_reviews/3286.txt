Wonderful read!
LOVED LOVED LOVED it! This book tugs on the heart strings (some will definitely need tissues handy).  This story is one of the most wonderfully written books that I've read in a while.  Jasinda Wilder has a way with words that can not be undone.  Colton and Nell have honestly become some of my favorite characters.  In some way most women can relate to Nell, maybe not in the same life alternating way, but because she is human and has found her first love. Definitely recommend this book!<3 you Jasinda!
