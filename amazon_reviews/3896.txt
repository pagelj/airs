I bought this as an alternative to my Cuisinart Grind & Brew which is a chore to clean daily. From the reviews I read I thought I would like it-but alas no. the 1st cup of coffee was ok-but just. From then on the coffee was lukewarm-and  I am talking a time lapse of 5 or 10 minutes. Used it twice and then sent it to the charity shop. I went back to the drip style and bought a burr grinder and a Kitchen Aid 14 cup drip that is great.
