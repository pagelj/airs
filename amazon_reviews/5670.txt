YN-560 & YN-602 Good and Bad
I have had 2 of the Yongnuo YN-560 flash units.  They are used as slave units in an outdoor salty moist beach environment.  The first unit lasted a bit less than a year.  I had been pleased with performance and immediately replaced it with a new flash.  If you need a slave flash it is a great buy for the money.  The down side is that even though there is a published 1 yr warranty, in my opinion it is USELESS.  After a number of emails I determined that they will not honor the warranty. I did get one response that suggested they would look at the unit ONLY IF i paid shippng to and from China. If purchasing one, do so with the expectation that it is "throw away" in a year.  Depending on the usage and expectations, this may not be such a bad deal for the performance it offers. I have also had similar results with the Yongnuo RF-602 remote flash trigger unit. A good unit for the price.  The down side is that the product changed feature functionality with no notice making the unit unusable for many PC sync applications.  Had to buy a new one to find out that it was changed and no longer worked in an advertised mode with PC Sync.
