Just fantastic
John Scalzi triumphs in a spectacular portrayal of humanity in the context of space warfare and colonial defense.  The universe that Scalzi creates is woven expertly with elements of science fiction that brilliantly are made plausible in the context of this story.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
