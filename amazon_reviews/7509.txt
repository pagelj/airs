Was not happy with the DVD player
Was not happy thought I could get a DVD cheaper. When it arrived I hooked it up to the car and the main screen was fine except you had to work at it to get the screen to close where the DVD goes. Would have dealt with that but then the other screen would only play sound and the movie the only thing were lines.
