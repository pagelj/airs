Beautiful and Convenient !!!
Received the unit in an extremely timely fashion considering Amazon was out of stock when I ordered, I was willing to wait, as their price and free shipping was better than anyone on this item. I read all the reviews before purchasing, learned very little, it was a "mixed bag". We have had it for about 3 weeks, first, appearance, very sharp, looks great in our new all stainless kitchen, it is truly ALL stainless steel. We replaced a 12 year old Oster toaster oven, that did NOT toast evenly. This one toasts beautifully and evenly. Works great for small casseroles, rather than heating the big oven. The negative is the rack, when pulled out it starts to literally fall out of the oven, potentially, if not careful, you may burn yourself. There is no STOPPER on the rack. Therefore, 4 stars on a lovely, useable oven.
