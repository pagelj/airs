sleek, simple, lightweight
I like this laptop case because it's very lightweight and also because of its simple design.  I might have liked it even better if it had some sort of side pocket where you could put a few pens and stationery, or a notebook or something. Otherwise, thought it was very reasonably priced and a good, basic laptop protector case.
