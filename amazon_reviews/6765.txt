Best point and shoot EVER!
I own a Nikon D800 and I must say that the Sony DSC-RX100 is by far the best compact camera out there. If you know how to use it, the resulting images are simply amazing. It Does phenomenally well in low light. I shoot RAW exclusively and do post processing in Adobe Lightroom 4. Even at 6400 ASA the images can be tweaked and look great.  All the negative reviews here about this camera must have been written by people who have no clue how to use a high end camera such as this. The quality is outstanding. Using it and understanding the interface takes a little time. But once who do understand and have it set up to your liking it is sweet. Battery life is great. The flash takes about 4 seconds between shots to charge. This is NOT a big deal. It is a point and shoot and not a DSLR. In closing I like to say to the nay-Sayers, do your homework, practice and get used to the camera. In the end this is the best compact camera. Period
