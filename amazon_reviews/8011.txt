Remember - you get what you pay for.
The mount is well made, easy to assemble and it does hold the TV.  However, a couple of things I did not read in other reviews are: 1) It mounts close to the wall, I mean close, so I used 3/4 in. plywood shims to overcome this problem. 2) Even after using the shims there is almost no tilt angle available, so if it is alright that it mounts flat against the wall you'll be ok. 3) If the TV power cord is a "straight" plug this mount is difficult to work with unless you shim it out, if not the cord is placed in a difficult bend.  If you need a mount with some functionality or for something other than just holding the TV flat to the wall there are other mounts capable of doing more - but they come at a higher price .  Otherwise, for the price this mount is functional and will do the job.
