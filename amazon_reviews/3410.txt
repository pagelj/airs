Great book! Tasty cookbook
This book is beautiful. The stories are thoughtful and provide a window in Louisiana culture and tradition. The photos are so vivid just like the flavors in the cuisine. And the recipes are easy to follow. Though, from time to time they require some interesting ingredients. Besh even provides information on where and how to track down those ingredients. Can't wait to make the king cake this weekend. Happy Mardi Gras Mambo!
