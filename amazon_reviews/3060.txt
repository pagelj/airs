A Pilgrim's Progess for the 21st Century and Beyond
Dan Simmons has created a marvelous feat in the first of the fours novels centred around the planet Hyperion.  The novel plays a science fiction variation on the Canterbury Tales as the pilgrims in the story each relate their six individual stories, beginning with the priest's tale.  This structure allows the reader to glimpse parts of the mystery of their quest with each story and watch the layers of narratives build up into a delightful structure.  Along the way echoes of such divergent authors as Robert Heinlein, Raymond Chandler, Stephen King and William Gibson sound throughout the stories while the voice always remains in the able hands of the author.  The theme of time is played with marvelously throughout the novel as it becomes, in a sense, another character.  As the Canterbury Tales slides into the Wizard of Oz the book ends, but this reader eagerly looks forward to beginning the next part of the tale.
