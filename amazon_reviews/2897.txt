Cancel your plans, you won't be putting this book down!
This is the first review I have ever been compelled to write. Wool captivated me from the beginning and is unlike anything I have ever read. Truly well deserving of the 5 star rating! I am among the thousands of hardcore fans anxiously awaiting more! I have recently purchased copies for friends because I am so insistent they read it!
