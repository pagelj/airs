Seemed like a good idea...
Shipping was very fast.  I used this product right away to make a music CD and a Data DVD.... Both came out great.  I last time I tried to use this, it took about three attempts to burn a DVD.  On the third attempt, the voice was out of sync from the video. Don't know if it was a software issue or just the unit itself.  Either way, it was a better option than replacing my defective optical drive in my 2009 MBP or to spend $80 on the Apple external optical drive.
