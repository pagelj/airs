great pack for the price
bought one for myself and one for my daughter.  we just used them once so far on a one night hike and camp.  so i can't say anything about durability yet.  very comfortable fit... easy to adjust for height.... my daugher is 5'7" and i'm 6'.  we were able to adjust so they fit each of us just right. i like the way the pack is set up/organized.  and yes we were able to fit our sleeping bags though they were a tight fit.  thanks to the fellow that posted the video of packing his sleeping bag we knew we could do it!
