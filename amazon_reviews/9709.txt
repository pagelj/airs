Huge range in a compact package
This lens was one of my main reasons for going dSLR. I do a lot of [amateur] bird photography, and needed the zoom. But, due to back and shoulder problems, I couldn't handle the weight and bulk of a "normal" telephoto lens. The 70-300 mm of the Olympus Four Thirds system is, in fact,a range of 140-600 mm, which is great for the kind of photography I do. Meaning I get the range without the extra weight. The 70-300 mm is easy to handle, it's reliable and solid. It doesn't do great in low light, but that isn't really a concern for me since my photos are mostly daytime, with lots of natural light. There is a learning curve to it, though, but it is mostly a hands-on thing: take lots of pictures, study them, analyse the EXIF data, figure out what could have been done differently or better. Photography is fun!
