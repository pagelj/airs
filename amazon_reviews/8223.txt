I currently own a Panasonic vacuum: it's an older model - big red thing - heavy as sin.  I didn't expect much from this replacement, but it really attacks carpets and does a decent job! PROS:- Lightweight.  YAY.  Has a smaller footprint than my older vacuum too.- Bagless.  Do ANY vacuums still use a bag anymore!?- Looks cool.  A metalic purple vacuum is going to be the only item I'll ever allow to be metallic purple.- All attachements fit ON BOARD.  FINALLY: No more random vacuum parts at the back of my closet!- Retractable cord!  YAY!  Any appliance that you need to move around (clothes iron, etc) should have a retractable cord! It's awesome.- Foot switches.  To turn it on or off, retract the cord, or switch to bare floor mode - all can be done with your foot.- Powerful!  It really tears up them carpets - leaves good lines too.  Really does a good job scrubbing!----------CONS:- Canister is a little on the small side. Not really a concern for me - I live alone and have no pets so it's OK for me.- Dust gets caught in the base.  After vacumming a lot, take a look at the base of the unit where the agitator is: you'll find a clump of dust jammed in the corner.  Kind of a bummer.  You have to scrape it out.- Canister rubber seal moves:  When I open the canister, the rubber seal between the upper and lower part of the canister comes off.  I have to push it back into place each time.  Poorly made.  Kind of sad.------------BUT.  Overall, it works really well. Easy to maneuver, powerful, makes the carpets look great, and takes up less space than my old one.  I approve.
