those darn knives!!!
I bought this set, a set of 16 for my parents.  They are (mostly) great, love the spoons and forks.  They are great sizes and work for everyone, kids and adults alike.  But THE KNIVES!!!!  If you are trying to clear the table, wear closed toed shoes.  At least half of the knives WILL fall on the floor.  It is neat, and looks great as a setting, but they will just not rest on the plate.  I would definitely not buy these again.  When it comes time to fill in the set or start over, starting over will be choice number one.
