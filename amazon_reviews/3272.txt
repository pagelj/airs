Suprisingly Great Album
Im actually an 18 year old reviewer.  Just didnt feel like registering.  I would like to say that I hated my chemical romance for a LONG time.  I loved Bullets... and it all went down hill from there when i saw them live and three chears released and became one of the most cliche albums in the rock scene.  When i saw them play live a few years ago i was saddened by how bad they did.  I saw them on tv recently and they sounded excellent live.  When i listened to this album I left myself with an open mind, considering that MCR sold out the minute they entered the music scene.  These guys entered the music scene being a sell out band and always will.  But that doesnt mean they dont have talent.  Though this album is far from original and steals from rock over many years it isnt far from MCRs old style except that its much better and is a really good rocking album.  Time will only tell how true they really are to their music.
