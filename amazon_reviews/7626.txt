Just what I wanted.
Does everything my old unit did and more.  The USB feature works great. I can load CDs into my laptop library,then transfer to the USB, then play on CD player.. multiple, multiple albums.  The only drawback I have seen is with the headphone jack.  It is the old 1/4" jack that most phones today do not use.  For under two dollars, I got an adaptor and now all lis well
