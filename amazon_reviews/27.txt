Super Durable and Protects Pefectly
I usually hate screen protectors because most scratch easily, collects dust, or become sticky or tacky when using them.  The Tech Armor Premium HD screen protectors have a great "almost" glass type feel that glides well with fingers or stylus and has protected my screen from many drops.  My most recent drop was from the height of my truck bed onto asphalt nd the screen protector got busted up and I thought my screen was damaged too... but after peeling it off, to my surprise, screen was perfectly fine except for some scratches on the metal frame around the screen.  Extremely please with the result.  It come with 3 so its a bargain if you need to replace them from time to time.  Install is super easy and I recommend spraying some Windex or screen cleaner liquid to do a wet install for perfect position and zero bubbles.
