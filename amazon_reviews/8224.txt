Great BluRay if You Don't Need Netflix-But Then, What's The Point?
I really wanted to like this. CR recommended it too. I won't rehash what other reviewers have said about how nice it plays BluRay. It does. Network & Netflix are another story. Sadly, I love Panasonic players and that's all I've purchased in the last 15 years. This is the first going back. My Wii placed in the same location loads and plays Netflix faster than this model. That is, IF you can get Netflix and/or a network connection at all. Please don't doubt my expertise. I have a wireless N network setup in my home, networked with Xbox, PS3, Roku, and Wii. All of them play flawlessly whether on the stream, or with online gaming. This one on the other hand has failed. Yes, the firmware has been updated (after multiple failed attempts), so it's not that. Looking elsewhere now.
