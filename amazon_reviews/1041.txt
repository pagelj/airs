Do not put any stock in the "water resistance" ability of this product
Purchased this watch because it is digital and water resistant. After reading the instructions it says not to push any buttons while in the water..... I was disappointed that this was not stated in the description. Then again I didn't expect too much from an inexpensive watch but at least they could tell you a bit more information about the button pushing while in the water. If I knew now what I knew then I would have purchased a better watch instead.
