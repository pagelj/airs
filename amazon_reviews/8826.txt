Could've had four stars if it lasted 2 years or more
I bought the dual screen player about a year and 3 months ago and LOVED IT!  It kept my kids entertained on long trips, and was loud enough and the screens were big enough for everyone in the back of the minivan.  I also like how simple the screens just click onto the head rest. What I don't like is the power cable that comes with it.  The cord is short and super thin.  It only took a month or two for the wire to get a short in it.  The other thing I don't like is that after all the research I did on dual screen portable DVD players, these were at the top as far as reviews, usability, features and quality... for the price of course... but it didn't last more than 1 year and 3 months! right after the warranty ran out!!! the main player had a bad motor in it... I'm lucky my credit card company has an extended warranty benefit.  Since I still believe that for the price, these are probably some of the best portable dvd players to buy, I went with the next model up.. the PD9016 model with TWO DVD players, rather one DVD player and one screen.  That way when one dies, the other can be the DVD player.... I'm hoping.
