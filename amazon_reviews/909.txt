Favorite little appliance
I didn't purchase on Amazon, but I have had this product for about 8 years and its still kicking! I originally bought this because it was cheap and I liked the idea of making my own protein shakes without a lot of cleanup. This little gem turned my protein shakes into quick "milkshakes." I am able to throw a few pieces of frozen fruit in, along with some almond milk and a scoop of protein and I've got a quick, delicious shake! If you're looking for something for multiple ingredients, its probably not going to work because it only holds about 16 oz, and that's to the rim. But for a quick shake on the go, this is the answer!
