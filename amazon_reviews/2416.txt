Excellent for picking up small items. It is the best vacuum as far as suction that I have ever used. It seems to be self-propelled (even though the literature doesn't state this). It is lightweight. The suction is much better than Tyson or Oreck. I love the height adjuster being at the top of the handle. The foot lever needs to be on the opposite side.
