Good but the remote is terrible.  Get the XS or newer Roku 3.
I already reviewed the Roku 2 XS and praised its simplicity.  This is pretty much the same with some additional hardware feature you may find useful in the XS missing.  However the remote is just poor.  Really need to pretty much dead on with the roku to get it to work. The XS remote is MUCH better
