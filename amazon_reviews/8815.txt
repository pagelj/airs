This is my first knife set I have ever bought (I just finished college!). I was looking around Amazon for an inexpensive, full set of knifes for general cooking/eating. These are REALLY nice knives and cut WAYYY better than Walmart knives at the same cost (probably will be the same quality at 2-3x the cost of Walmart knives). One little con: it came with an extra pair of scissors as opposed to some other big knife...
