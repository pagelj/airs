does everything but toast uniformly
Wow! A toaster that handles thick slices, wide slices,toasts bagels and sandwiches.  Unfortunately it does not toast properly - especially breads that are not dense.  The middle (horizontally) burns while top and bottom are OK.  I lower setting so that middle does not burn, then top and bottom are untoasted.  Problem is not as bad with dense packaged bread but toaster is simply unusable for rustic and other similar breads.  I realize that no toaster will do everything - BUT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TOAST.
