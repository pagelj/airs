Sweet little machine!
This is one sweet little machine, a full Windows laptop at an incredible price.  With amazing sound through the speakers! The Windows 8 "Metro" interface starts to make some sense on a touch screen.  Personally, I think MS has a ways to go here, but I can see what they were thinking. If, like me, you install one of the free utilities available to skip Metro altogether, you've essentially got a Windows 7 system with all the under the hood improvements that Win 8 brings, plus touch screen capabilities.  I really like getting my hands off the keyboard and mouse, and for some tasks in particular (like scrolling long pages) the touch interface on the traditional desktop works great. All this in a beautiful package so light that you don't hesitate to bring it along.  Battery life at ~5 hours is a bit shorter than I'd prefer, and the arrow keys are small, so they take a little getting used to, but I am NOT complaining. The true test, of course, is with the household computer snob, whose usual comment about any laptop is "a Macbook Air is so much better," but who has voiced not a word of complaint about this machine.
