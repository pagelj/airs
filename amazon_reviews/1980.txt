Still the best of class
I bought this SDHC card to replace the one that I originally had for my camera (it's an older model, a Canon Rebel t1i, because my previous card kept buffering out when I was taking too many photos  or taking videos (I take photos and video of fencing matches, so capturing photos quickly is essential.)This card has assuredly not let me down... but of course. Class 10 is still the best that there is, and SanDisk is still (in my opinion) the premier brand for SDHC cards.
