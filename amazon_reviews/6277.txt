It makes a perfectly hot cup of coffee in 90 seconds (Kuerig is 60 seconds and 1 degree hotter ).  The scoop is stone simple and you can use it with any coffee.  Just rinse the scoop out.  No filters and no K cups that cost .50-$1.00 each or K-cup pain-in-the-tuckus-load-your-owns .  I just fill a mug with water and dump it in to the reservoir.  No need to measure.  Almost all the volume you put in comes out. Will fill any size up to a travel mug. There's a flip plate that the cup sits on.  Put it the high position for standard cups. Add a little more or a little less grounds to get the volume or strength.  It shuts off automatically when it's done.  I bought a refurb and apart from the factory sticker on the box, you'd never guess it wasn't retail.  It came with two scoops. It's a bargain, and will keep saving you money.
