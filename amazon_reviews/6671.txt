One of the best reads in a long time
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is haunting- but not in the superstitious, creepy way. More in the way that you think of the book long after reading it. This review is about 7 months after reading, and I still felt the need to review it for others. It's got mystery, action, adventure, and heartbreak. It's unique as well with the pictures and writing style. I highly recommend it and am excited for the upcoming movie as well!
