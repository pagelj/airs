Revel in Resurrection
It is a rare story that keeps one awake reading all night. Dayton lures us into a world that is so skillfully based on truth that it could easily be real, that moves so quickly and intelligently that it becomes vital to stay alert and, alas, hungrily turning the pages.  With characters that you care about immediately and vivid action sequences, this is one of those books that draws you in and holds you there.  One walks about wondering how Pruit is doing and what is happening with the Eschless Funnel... right here, in the real world... hey, it could happen!  This book is all at once a grand escape as well as a peak into something much bigger than ourselves.  Don't bother making any appointments.  It's impossible to put down.
