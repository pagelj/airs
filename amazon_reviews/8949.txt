Disappointed
This item has been a disappointment.  The VCR no longer works.  If I can get a tape to play, the tracking is messed up and when I try to adjust it, nothing happens.  The DVD player still works, however.  I bought this due to the large volume of VHS tapes I had.  I thought it would work out favorably for us, but it did not.
