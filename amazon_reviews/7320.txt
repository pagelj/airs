If you have little space and PAL videos, buy this
With very little shelf space available and about 200 PAL-format videos I need a player that lets me watch my valued British DVDs. Several off-brand models over the years have lasted a couple years and then die. I fully expect this to follow that pattern, but with a real difference. It is about 1/3rd the cost of the last unit I purchased. At about the size of a good hardbound novel, it fits just about anywhere. There are only a few things (understandable at the price) that keep this from a higher rating:1. Limited outputs. This only has standard Video and Audio RCA outputs, and a digital audio output. It would be nice if it had an HDMI out.2. It takes a couple seconds to recognize the Power On press on the remote before a tiny green light comes on. My wife got frustrated and pressed the button again, shutting it off, before we figured that out. This is a minor point.3. The drawer is, as others have pointed out, flimsy. This makes this player only good for adults with steady hands. I wouldn't let a child use it nor would I allow my mother. But, for the price it is a nice unit. Setup took a minute and a half but would have been shorter if I had bothered to read the minimal documentation.
