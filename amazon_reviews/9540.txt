Horribly buggy
I've been using Toast for over a decade, but I never remember any previous version being THIS creaky. Upon installing you should IMMEDIATELY run the built-in updater, since even the versions downloaded direct from Roxio don't have the updates built-in. I'm still having issues with painfully slow BD-R50 burns, random unexplained lock-ups, poor import video file support, and laughably bad AVCHD camcorder support. (Did you know those camcorders split the video files at the 4GB mark? Toast doesn't!) You also can't hide the mostly-useless new file browser, which takes up a lot of the screen. (Guys, Macs have Drag and Drop, and have for the past 15 YEARS!!)I'd love to use some of the new features, and having an easy way to go from camcorder to Blu-ray sounds pretty darn good. Unfortunately, until they do some MAJOR bug fixing, Toast Titanium 11 (Pro) is a giant hunk of crap. I've kept my copy and gone back to Toast 10, hoping future updates will alleviate some of the pain.
