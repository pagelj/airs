Great for the money
Works great, and I have no complaints, except that it's a bit of a pain to put on.  You can't even tell it's there.  So far it's done it's job well, though I've only had it for about 2 months.  Seems to be doing it's job pretty well, especially considering we didn't have to pay the apple price tag :-)
