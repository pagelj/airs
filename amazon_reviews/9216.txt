Good for what it is
Bought this as a second computer to have around and just browse the interweb, nothing more.  And it works great, it is simple to setup and simple to use. The only drawback is I was looking to use it mostly to stream ESPN3 to my TV using the HDMI connection but the live feed is blurry and the replay video is not that good either.  The device does not have the capacity to handle I guess. But it works good otherwise.
