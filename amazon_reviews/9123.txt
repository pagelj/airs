The bestest for the leastest.  Knives are obviously not high grade steel for this price, however, for a non commercial kitchen this the without reservation the best I could find.  The knives must be hand washed as do most higher lines.  The 8 Steak knives do not flex as in some much higher priced sets.  (because they are overpriced)  You get a shapening hone which by itself is a 35 to 40 dollar item.  You will not be disappointed!!!!!
