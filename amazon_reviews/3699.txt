I love this thing.
I love this thing.  It was well thought out.  My Samsung 17.3" laptop fits perfectly. The tablet pocket is awesome for my Nexus 7.  I LOVE that they have a pocket for the power brick on the outside of the backpack.  The main compartment is huge for several books and folders.  I don't even have enough stuff to fill the smaller compartment.  I haven't used it yet but I love the idea of the compression flap.  I won't use it until the Spring or Summer but I thought it was a good idea. I had reservations about the lumbar pocket but it is heavily padded.  Another great idea to keep your important stuff safer.  The small pocket at the top is brilliant.  Great pocket for my sunglasses.  The designers of this thing should get a raise. I found it very comfortable to wear.  I love the simple, sleek black. It isn't "busy" like the other backpacks I've seen.  So far, every pocket I found on this thing is damn useful. Some minor cons:I love that you can roll up the excess strap BUT did wish they added one for the smaller straps too.  I just bought those Velcro ties and used those for the smaller strap.  Like everyone else said, there is minimal padding (but there is padding) at the bottom of the laptop.  I'd be gentle when setting it down. Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase.
