Great camera
I used to have Canon cameras before the digital age, then went from Olympus digital to Nikon or Fuji for digital. It feels great to be back to Canons and have a quality digital camera.  It has all the features I wanted for close-ups/macro, indoor and outdoor photo, SLR.  And the price on Amazon was really attractive!  I am very happy with my new acquisition.
