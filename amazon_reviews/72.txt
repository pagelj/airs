Snapshooter happy with SL1
Pre-ordered SL1 to replace old Rebel xSi in April 2013 before a trip to Europe. Huge technological step forward. Got 18-135mm STM for greater range than kit lens; still very compact. Brought 50mm 1.8 but never took 18-135 off camera - fast enough. Took 2000+ shots plus some video; few bad shots. Low light performance astonishing; even ISO 6400 in near-darkness very usable with little noise (I shot entirely in JPEG). Smartphone users will find touch screen intuitive and easier than menu surfing; long-time Canon users will find customary buttons familiar. Well-balanced even with longer lens; body comfortable in large hands. Light weight ideal to wear around neck all day. Instant availability of video; can shoot stills within. Unlike T5i, SL1 screen fixed, not swivel, fine with me. Other features lacking versus T5i: stereo microphone (SL1 is monaural) and some multi functionality of cross keys - IMO, small price to pay for lighter weight. For ready shooting on the fly, I used mostly in no-flash full-auto mode; for greater precision, used AV for focus-point and DoF control.  (Can't opt for center-point focusing in full auto.) BTW, 64G Class 10 SD card was overkill for my trip, used only 15G. Very happy with this camera and 18-135mm lens.
