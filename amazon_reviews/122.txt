So disappointing. It's May, I got it in January, and it's dead. Smoke started coming out of it! I kept it clean and free of deposits with a vinegar/water cleansing. Didn't matter. In just a couple of months, the pressure dropped, the espresso came out weaker. Now, it just blinks, and runs even when it's supposed to be 'off' building pressure only. Sigh. Never again, Mr. Coffee.
