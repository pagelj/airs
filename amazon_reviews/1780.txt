Totally excellent and not selling out
When I heard that MCR were coming out with another CD I was very afraid of what I would hear.  After the success of songs like Im Not Okay, Helena, and Ghost of You I thought I was going to lose one of my favorite bands.  I heard Welcome to the Black Parade and wasn't really impressed. Then I picked up the CD.  I gave it a listen through and heard lots of things I liked.  Mostly with this CD you have to accept that MCR is trying something different and all the songs arent going to sound like Three Cheers.  Theres bits that feel like their debut, then Three Cheers, then Queen inspired riffing.  I would say best tracks are "Cancer", "Dead!", "Teenagers", "Disenchanted", and "House of Wolves".  With the songs they are all a good mix of slow and fast songs so it never becomes boring. I think this CD is a lot more creative and a lot more inspired.  It also shows that Gerard doesn't let fame go to his head.  He has always said that he wouldn't let the posers and fly by night fans dictate what music he creates.  Although I know a lot of people will throw the "sellout" flag too soon I would suggest taking another listen and get the lyrics.  It's really a well made CD.
