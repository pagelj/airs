Light sci-fi story
I just finished up this book on my Kindle(I grabbed it as a special of the day), and it was a nice light Sc-Fi read. It had a nice backstory and moves at a good pace. I think this book would make a good Cable Channel mini-series, as it would have to have some length to capture the feel of the book. The only real critque I have is that the Author's writing is not quite fully developed. There are passages where she could have really taken it to a higher level, but did not. Being that this is only her second book, I think she has a good potential to develop and become a good quality Sc-fi, so I won't hold it against her much. I think it would be interesting to write a prequel or a series of stories set in the world she has created. Or even prehaps a sequel, as I think it would be interesting to see where the story goes. Overall, a good read and a solid 4 stars out of 5. I am interested to see what this author has to offer next.
