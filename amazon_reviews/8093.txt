Don't believe the USB 3.0 gimmick
First off, let me say I'm not knocking this product, I'm knocking the difference between theory and reality. I have another Western Digital 1 TB desktop external drive (USB 2.0), which I love and has served me well with no issues for three years. I do a lot of photo and video editing, so I wanted a drive that could transfer and back-up files faster. I tested both drives with a sample folder of mixed photo and video files. Also timed a back-up using the Windows 7 tool and achieved similar results to the below test. USB 2.0 drive: Averaged between 33 mb/s and 60 mb/s. USB 3.0 drive: Averaged between 60 mb/s and 90 mb/s. The USB 3.0 drive took about half as long to transfer the folder. USB 3.0 theoretical limit is 5 Gbps, which is 640 mb/s. It's maximum theoretical transfer speed is about 10x faster than USB 3.0 Keyword is theoretical in this case. Even at it's fastest, the drive was only writing at around .7 Gbps. That is definitely more than the USB 2.0 limit, but nowhere near the maximum theoretical limit. My laptop has two drives in it and I transferred the same folder from my 7,200 rpm drive to my SSD drive. Both have SATA 6GB/s. Got roughly the same transfer speeds as the 3.0 drive. On the plus side, the drive is very small and relatively quiet. Slightly louder than my desktop external, but considering it's probably 1/5 the size I don't mind.
