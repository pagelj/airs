Terrific Digital Camera
It arrived before I expected it.  Everything  included except SD card and camera case, which I had also ordered and received.  It comes with a USB to transfer pictures to computer.  Also very good instructions, including a CD.  I have not taken pictures yet but know the quality because of a friend who sent pictures to me from the same camera.  I always read Amazon's reviews before purchasing anything.  I am thrilled with the products Amazon sells, except for bird seed and plant soil.  Those sellers charge too much postage for my pocketbook.
