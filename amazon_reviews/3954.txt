Great app for movie lovers
This app does it all, and not just for mainstream movies, but Indy flicks as well. You can see reviews from critics and friends as well as purchase tickets for participating theatres. Even link your ultraviolet digital copies to your flixster account.  Couldn't be more satisfied with a movie app.
