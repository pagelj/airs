I bought this vacuum based upon prior experience with a Eureka cannister vac.  Very inexpensive but lasted a long time and worked great!  This one promises to have the same advantages as the one I had.  Powerful suction, relatively light weight.  I'd ask for a better way of storing the attachments and a retractable power cord.  However if those are my only complaints during the time I own this machine, I'll feel lucky!
