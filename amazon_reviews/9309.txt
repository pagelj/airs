Love it!
I'm still learning to use this camera, but so far i love it as a starter camera.  i haven't had any problems using the camera indoors... and with enough natural light, pictures come out very clear and beautiful.  I am adding a picture i took of my daughter to show how great this camera is.  Only complaint i have so far is the digital instruction manual.  I wish they included a hard copy of it.
