Great for Price BUT...
So far this is a fantastic convection oven. The ease of all the functions is amazing. The look is great as well. I cooked 12 muffins in 20 minutes instead of the 35 minutes I normally bake them. The con is that the top, the door and glass gets extremely HOT and you can get a serious burn if you accidentally bump it.  I already burnt my knuckles opening it since the handle is close to the door frame that was about 400 degrees. The other con is that I have been trying to contact them (Breville) to find out what the safe distance is between the top of the unit and the cabinets above it but have not received a reply via email nor Facebook so it is still sitting in the middle of the counter top.
