So I really went back & forth between this toaster and the pastel kidkraft one that matches her pastel kidkraft kitchen.  The much lower price of this one was the determining factor, and I am extremely happy I chose this one it looks great with her kitchen and was such a reasonable price!  The honey bottle is adorable! And it is really built to last! If you are on the fence, do it!
