I don't even books but wow
This is only the second book that I've read willingly on my own without a teacher making me read it or needing to do research or whatever else. Purely for my own enjoyment and I got hook on the whole series. I'm on Broadcast 5 now. I love this book. Very sci-fi, Stargate, Starwars, Star Trek style.
