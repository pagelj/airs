Riveting
I don't usually write reviews on here, but this book begs for it and since he's an independent author I thought I'd toss a good review his way.  THIS BOOK IS AMAZING.  Fine literature which will probably be taught in every university?  No.  Riveting?  Captivating?  Absolutely.  I haven't had my heart pound during a book in years nor had this much fun.  I practically cried out at points the tension was so high.  This book screams to be made into a fantastic movie provided they don't screw it up, IE "Red Planet" or get too artsy.
