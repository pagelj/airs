Looking to replace my 2 year old Hoover Windtunnel T series.  I thought I would go up a price level to get a lighter & better quality vacuum.  to begin, I thought this would feel much lighter it did not, this was especially the case when the beater brush was turned off, then it appeared to have no self propulsion at all.  There are no manual settings for carpet height so the beater brush is either on or off - I did not like that aspect for some of my finer hand made rugs.  Also, although the wand had a long tube & attachments it was much too complicated to use, not easy to switch back & forth from wand to floor.  For the money these were too many negatives so I decided to return it.
