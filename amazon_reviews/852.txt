Great little notebook
I gave this notebook as a gift this Xmas.  The initial feel of the OS is quite different to a user who is used to PC/windows.  However, after a few uses this is easily overcome.  The notebook is very light weight and has excellent speed.  Web pages cannot be opened to view in full screen so that makes viewing a little more difficult but You Tube will display as Full screen.  We are android phone users and a re used to using the google store app but the app for the Chromebook is different and doesn't seem to have the full host of apps available.  Overall we are very satisfied with this item and the functionality based upon the pricing.
