Don't rent China, Go with this to Save $$$
I purchased this for my wedding, rather than renting expensive China. I am glad I purchased this. It looks elegant, and it is durable. The forks looked like silver too. Guests were surprised it was plastic, when they picked up the forks. This is a good bargain if you are having a special occasion.
