Unbelievably awesome, geek-friendly warranty
We are rough on electronics in our household, so when I bought my wife a new laptop I also bought a SquareTrade warranty. Drops and spills are kind of our MO. Sure enough, a month later, we dropped the new laptop 4" onto a table and the hard drive rolled over and died. I happen to be a giant techie nerd, so I replaced the drive with one from an older laptop immediately so my wife could keep using her new computer. SquareTrade not only honored the warranty - even though I'd already fixed the problem on my own - they told me to pick out my own replacement hard drive and then send them the invoice. They told me it was ok if the hard drive I purchased was better than the original one, since "hard drives are always getting bigger" and "the self-repair saves them money on labor". Such common sense! Instead of penalizing me for rolling up my sleeves and fixing our problem as other warranties have done in the past (coughAPPLECAREcough), they just seemed pleasantly surprised that I could help them help me. Geek-friendly warranties. They said it couldn't be done, and then SquareTrade knocked it out of the park. They've just won themselves one gadget-obsessed household as customers for life.
