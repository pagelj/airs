I love this thing!
Purchased as a referbed model. Like most referbed stuff purchased in the past it was delivered in like new condition. If they weren't so expensive back in the day, I would definatly say, "I wish I had purchased on a long time ago." It's very easy to set up and get recording without much manual studying. It seems to do everything I want it to do but I'm not asking for to much. I just wanted to record my saved DVR movies and some shows. I just select the highest quality recording mode that will cover the length of my program, start the program, and push record. Just don't forget to seect "finalize" when done recording or the disc will not play back. I mostly record and save to disc Turner classic movies. I have loved the oldies since I was a teen. I have tried to record a modern show saved on my DVR (the walking dead) but it was blocked. I was able to trick it into recording once but only once. All other attempts failed. No biggie, I expected some stuff to be blocked anyway. Most all other good stuff (for my tast) recoreds reliably. I picked this recorder because it was the highest end unit in the price range. Mostly due to it being a referbed unit. It does much more than I need it to. I'm very happy with it! Shipping was fast!
