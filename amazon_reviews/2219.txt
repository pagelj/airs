Roomy and modern
This bag is a bit roomier than I thought it would be, which was a pleasant suprise.  It's large enough to hold various items for my children but allows me to still look like I am carrying a modern bag--rather than a diaper bag.  My children 4 and 2, so I only have to take diapers for the younger one and a few distractors!  These fit well, along with my things.  The bag is also made very well and looks as if it will hold up well for a busy mom on the go!  Love it!
