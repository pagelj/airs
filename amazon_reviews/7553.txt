My family has a 14 year old dog who has problems with incontinence and refuses to go to the bathroom outside, so we've spent the better part of 4 months cleaning up after her on our hands and knees with various cleaning solutions. The cost of Swiffer refills and pads was really starting to add up so we finally took a chance on this vacuum and couldn't be happier. The vacuum is easy to assemble (although it took me quite a bit of force and kajiggering to get the handle in all the way) and VERY easy to use. I love that all the buttons and knobs are toward the top of the vacuum so I don't have to bend over to adjust anything! It doesn't leave our hardwood floors looking brand spanking new, but it does make them look like no drop of dog pee has ever touched them, and that's all I need. The cleaning solution that comes with the vacuum smells great too and is not overpowering or headache-inducing. I think my only issue with the vacuum is that it doesn't do so well as just a vacuum--I usually have to go over the floors with another vacuum to get up all the dog hair and debris before using this one to wash it. If your floors get particularly grody like ours, cleaning the dirty water tank can be pretty nauseating too but that's all a part of cleaning I suppose.
