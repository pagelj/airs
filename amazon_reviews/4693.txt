First of all, I never write reviews but I felt that this product was noteworthy. I got tired of spending money on vacuums only to be disappointed. Not this time. A few things ... I joined consumer reports, wanted a vac that wasn't bag less(better for allergies), wanted strong suction, lightweight, didn't want to spend more than I needed to. This vac exceeded many high end vacs including the Dyson in customer satisfaction ratings. I highly recommend this product. My only concern was the lifespan which remains to be seen. I was shopping reputable brands comparable to Dyson. Make sure you check out the details of the warranty. Sometimes a 6 year warranty sounds great til you read the details. I'm thrilled with my choice. I am just as pleased with the mini vac that comes with the upright for use with attachments. If you are not completely satisfied they'll take it back. Buy the Hoover instead and you'll have a extra couple hundred bucks to spend on yourself 0= (for being the smart shopper!)
