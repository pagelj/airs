TOAST THE WAY TOAST SHOULD BE!
Since I wrote the review below I have been able to put the toaster through a test of bagel toasting.  All I can say is "absolutely perfect". With this toaster the news is "You get what you pay for". It took some time selecting a toaster this year. Quality and Cost were our main concerns. At first we looked at several $39.00 - $59.00 toasters and felt that the quality of construction left something to desire. They were light and flimsy. If we wanted a toaster to last a short time then any of these might have worked.  We then researched the toasters in the $100 price range and found this KitchenAid.  The quality of construction, coil structure and terrific ratings made up my wife and my minds. The test was now to see how the toaster actually worked. Wow, did it do a fine job on a cold piece of bread. The toast was toasted through and through.  Crisp on the outside and warm/semi-soft and consistant on the inside.  The kind of toast we wanted toast to be. We also like the fact that the toaster comes with a 1 year no hasstle warranty! I can not wait for my next toasted sandwich!
