For SOME reason it took FOREVER to find a perfect little black garbage can for our bathroom,that our little dog wouldn't be able to get into (loooves those tasty used tissue treats! :/ ) THIS works perfectly, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg like some of the others I've seen on here. Also, I like the fact it has a removable hard plastic "liner" inside,because that means you don't need bags OR have to take the whole can to empty it-QUITE convenient! For under 20 bucks w/ shipping,THIS is the one to get!
