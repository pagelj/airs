Torn straps within a month
I bought this bag so that I could carry my laptop around with me a bit easier. Within a month of having it, the shoulder straps began to tear. The repair process is less than hassle free, no pre-paid postage. However, I did fly with it and the smart scan did make things a lot easier.
