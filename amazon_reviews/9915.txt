Perfect for the guy who wants it all in one package
I started photography at twelve years old. I went through many fazes as developing and enlarging in my own darkrooms and multiple accessories including a bunch of lenses. Now I am seventy eight and want it simple, but I also want to do everything I did with the complicated outfits. The SX 40 does it! I just took it to a local popular lake. It was hazy. I used equivalent focal lengths from 24 to 1680 mm. I had no trouble getting sharp pictures under these conditions. I used it hand held. Hint, use the view finder and hold it steady not the LCD screen held out where it is not steady. That is okay for most shots but not long telephotos. I had an SX10 that I liked but with a double set of extra batteries it was heavy. The one lithium rechargeable needed for this is much lighter. I do carry a spare. This is not for the person who wants all the technical stuff as I once did but it is the one for me now.
