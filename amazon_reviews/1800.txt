I bought this microwave right after the Emerson I had in college quit, hoping that this one would last at least ten years. It fit perfectly into the space in my kitchen. It is a great size, big enough for a rotating cassarole dish, and cooks like a commercial brand oven. One month after delivery it quit! I am so angry! When I turn it on I get a digital error [HR???] that can only be repaired by the Panasonic Service Center 30 miles from my home. That's right, I have to load this heavy thing into my car, drive 30 miles to drop it off to have it repaired, and drive 30 miles back to pick it up. I just realized the 1-year warranty will expire in 2-weeks so I have to find someone strong enough to lift it into my car. I am soooo disappointed!
