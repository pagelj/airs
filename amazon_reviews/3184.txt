Tom's was right... best rechargeable NiMH
After burning through a pack of 16 disposable AA batteries in my digital camera, I finally resigned myself to the price of rechargeables. Now I wish I had went with rechargeables sooner. These batteries are inexpensive and their performance is OUTSTANDING!!! Just 2 of these batteries have powered my camera for about 3 weeks before needing to be recharged, outlasting all 16 of the disposables!
