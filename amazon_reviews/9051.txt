About 2 years ago, we adopted another dog.  She was older and already had some training.  It took a while, but we learned that she liked to get into the trashcan while we were gone.  However, she didn't do this every time we left and we never caught her doing it.  How did we know it was her?  She was the only one tall enough to get into the trash.  After one particular incident, I did some research about pet proof trash cans, and this model and the butterfly lid version kept coming up.  I really wasn't keen on spending $120 for a trash can (especially if it didn't work!), so I went with this model.  We have had it for 2 days so far and neither of the dogs have even looked at it.  We spent about 5 hours out of the house one day, and the can hadn't even been moved.  Maybe there's nothing in it that smells good, but so far, I'm really glad that the dogs aren't interested in the trashcan any more.  If it changes, I'll update the review.
