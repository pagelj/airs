I bought this for my small efficiency like apartment and thought this was better due to my limited space. I should've just went with a bigger vacuum because this one sucks (and not in a good way). It barely will pick up hair on the floor and I sprinkled carpet fresh/baking soda on my floor to freshen the carpet and it couldn't even pick that up. There is no suction which makes it very hard to pick up hair,crumbs, etc. from the carpet. The only way I can see this working is maybe using on a tile floor. I'm now forced with a vacuum that is useless and not even worth donating.
