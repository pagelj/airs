I got this coffee maker for my husband and he enjoys it so much.  He likes strong, dark coffee, and if you have it set to bold and use dark coffee, it turns out just as it should.  There were just a couple problems of coffee ground going everywhere when he opened the top after the coffee was brewed, but we narrowed it down to the fact that the coffee grounds should be evenly laying in the pod when you put it in to avoid a mess when you take it out.  Also, ensure that if you are unable to use a tall enough mug, or if the mug is too tall when you turn the shelf upside down, you need a towel or paper towel around for the coffee that slightly splashes out of the mug.
