Previous PowerShot owner who upgraded and is SUPER HAPPY
I owned my other PowerShot since 2007 and decided to buy a new one this year since my low-light pics were less than desirable with my old camera.  OMG!!  This camera is fantastic on the auto setting and I love the camera.  I also read some low reviews about getting the wi-fi established but I had no issues getting mine working since I called Canon customer service and had them walk me through the process.  Bottom line, I love this camera and it is worth every penny!
