Great iPad option
Lots of Apple product in the house + office over the last 14 years [Pro Macs, iMacs, iPods, iPads, etc]. Bought the Kindle as a holiday gift and e-reader option for the kids, but all of us really impressed by the Kindle Fire HD 8.9". Great performance and considering price, a really outstanding option to the iPad. May even add another at the house in 2013.
