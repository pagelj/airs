Awesome Camera
This dropcam is fantastic as an inexpensive security camera. It also can double as a notification of internet troubles as the LED turns amber when it can't connect out, and their system sends a noticication when it hasn't connected in a half hour. Fantastic video quality, though I wouldn't say HD. I've never gotten video quality that I could deem HD, and I have 5mb upload on my internet connection. All in all a fantastic camera, and if the video was actually HD it would have 5 stars.
