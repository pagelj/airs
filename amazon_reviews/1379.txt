Excellent illustrations
I loved the photos and the clever way the author intertwined the story into the pictures. I found this to be a very clever book. Unfortunately, about midway I lost total interest because it became sort of "Harry Potter-ish" and that isn't my genre. The story became too much like fantasy, and I am not a fantasy lover. But get it for the pics and the clever way the author writes.
