I bought this coffee maker a few weeks ago to brew decaf just for myself. If I have to drink decaf (which is far inferior, to my taste buds), then at least it should be easy. This coffeemaker fills the bill. Here are the points I have observed:Pros-the brew tastes decent (for decaf)-the brew time is fairly quick (less than 5 minutes for a full pot)-the coffee is hot enough-the clock does not have to be set in order for the machine to brew (which is great, because I unplug it between uses)-the heating element automatically shuts off after one hourCons-the clock display is not lighted, so the numbers are very difficult to read--this would make setting the programmed brew time annoying (I do not use this feature)-to get a full 4-cup brewed pot, the water reservoir must be filled to the very top of the window (past the mark labeled "max")*This is contrary to the manual.*-because of the shape of the pour spout, it is difficult to pour water into the reservoir without spilling (maybe that's just me)Other important points:-the filter basket (which holds the paper filter) only fits one way--the tab must be seated properly in the back-the top/lid that covers the reservoir and filter basket should be snapped shut before beginning a brew cycle-if you fill the reservoir above the "max" line (in order to brew a full 4 cups), cover the overflow hole (in the back) with your finger if you must move the coffeemaker into place on your counter top
