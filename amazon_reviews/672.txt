weak
I bought this camera for security at my wife's store. It was complicated to setup. Looked huge and cumbersome when mounted. Mounting equipment was flimsy and weak. Picture had lag and was not the best resolution. requires a static ip to allow for iphone viewing or you will constantly have to update the ip in your mobile device.2 weeks later i gave up and bought 2 dropcams. What a world of difference. took no time to setup and i get 7 day dvd backup on a could server audio, video, and picture are 100x better.
