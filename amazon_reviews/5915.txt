Better than anticipated for my new Mac
I bought this drive for my Mac and after reading several reviews I anticipated a few minutes of setup before I could use it.  This was definitely not the case! As soon as I plugged it in, the drive was up and running.  I did not have to reformat it as the description says.  To my surprise I was even prompted to by the computer to set up my time machine using the drive.  From what I read on the WD website this drive was not compatible with time machine on Apple computers, but it works great on mine! I have a brand new Macbook Pro that is currently running Lion and I did NOT have to reformat the drive and it works seamlessly with Apple time machine for automatic backups.  You can even still use it to store files that you don't want on your computer taking up space.
