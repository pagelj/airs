Absolutely easy
I have two internet streaming players in my living room, this one and the Apple TV MC572LL/A (2010). I found both to be incredibly easy to set up and use. I bought the Roku so that I could have access to internet TV stations such as EWTN and others. I am also an amazon prime customer, so this enables to stream lots of video from this websites These are things AppleTV does not offer. However, the AppleTV offers access to my iTunes library, and my TV is hooked up to my stereo system, so this means I use both players with regularity. The Roku is cheaper, and offers the same content as the AppleTV (minus the ability to use it as a media manager for your iTunes library). I find having both to be ideal, but if I were to choose just one player it would likely be the AppleTv due to the fact that I can use it for media on on machine as well as media in the "cloud."This player was incredibly easy to set up via my home wifi network. It is also very easy to use. One thing that does bother me about the Roku is that the operating system is clunky compared with Apple (no surprise there) but also there are advertisements at the bottom of the screen. Amazon right now is advertising "bad teacher" and the image is troublesome. I use these players in front of my kids, and would like to know that when I go to stream "Thomas the Tank Engine" for them, they are not be exposed to garbage. I hope Roku fixes this soon. Apple has done good work in this regard that the rest of the industry should emulate.
