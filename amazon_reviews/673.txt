I bought this toaster spur of the moment at Costco.  It looked great in the box at least.  We've had it just under a year and I have to set it to the highest toast setting in order to toast a piece of bread.  On top of that, it takes forever (at least compared to other toasters) to toast anything.  Word to the wise... don't buy!
