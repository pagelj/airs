Excellent product in a such a little box!
Roku XD does everything that I wanted it to do. I wanted a replacement to my cable service, which would give me access to movies and shows, but not the hefty bill. Roku works like a charm. Connected to my Prime and Netflix accounts, and some other online channels it is optimal replacement. Wireless is a blast to setup, took maybe less than 5 minutes to get it up and running. Only con that I would say is about the remote, it could have been nice to have a volume setting, so that you wouldn't need two remotes to get things work. I use a Logitech harmony 890 with it, so not much of a problem for me.
