BEST TOASTER OVEN YET !!
It's faster than a regular toaster oven, toasts perfectly without turning the bread hard or stale tasting. Reheats frozen foods fast and evenly, no waiting to preheat! It does take some getting used to in setting times, and some of the presets have to be pressed twiice to get the desired results......... but it's still fast and easy. I would recommend this to anyone who's tired of waiting for their toaster oven to heat up only to get burnt toast in the end........... GREAT  PRODUCT!
