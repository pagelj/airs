Worked for almost a whole hour
With all the good reviews and the low price this purchase was a no brainer but now I'm stuck with 3 of these things. I tried to use these to connect a DVD player to my Vizio and we did watch almost an hour of a movie before the loud shrieking began. The movie sound completely stopped and then there was all this awful noise. I tried the second cable and the same thing. I thought it might be the player so I grabbed some old school red, white and yellow cables and those worked just fine. Not the player, not the tv but the "too good to be true" cheap HDMI cable. I have not tried the 3rd one yet but I don't have much hope of it being better.
