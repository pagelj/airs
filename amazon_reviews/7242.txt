Great book - a tribute to geeks
I just loved this books.  It reminded me of the fun I had growing up programming computers and playing computer games.  I am a geek and proud.  If you love technology and it's development over the last 40 years, you will love this books.  If computers make you feel uneasy, you probably won't enjoy this so much.
