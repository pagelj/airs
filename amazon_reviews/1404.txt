I got my toaster last night and it's splendide! My family needed a new toaster and I thought that this one would be a fun replacement for our old one, and it is! How do I love it? Let me count the ways...1. Easy to useConsidering the fact that it toasts bread, cooks eggs AND warms meat, operating the machine is very simple. I didn't even have to read the instructions prior to use because I'm a rocket scientist with three doctorates and a Nobel Prize. But once you unfortunate bourgeoisie read the instructions you, too, will become masters of this machine.2. HealthyI used egg whites, Canadian bacon and a tiny dab of margarine on my sandwich and it tasted great. The McGrease and McMystery in those fast-food sandwiches propel me closer to an early death, which is not good, considering my intellectual value to society. Thank goodness for Canadian bacon, which allows health-conscious people to fool themselves into thinking they ate an exotic variation of bacon when, in fact, they just ate a thick and preternaturally round slice of ham.3. Quick & Low-MaintenanceYou really don't need to clean up after this thing... you just need to rinse those little food trays in the steamer. It sure beats cleaning up the skillets and pans you'd normally use to cook the meat and eggs. Of course, my servants manage such menial tasks... but I'm just offering my wisdom to you unfortunate laborers out there who will be making your own sandwiches. (Pity!)4. VersatilityIf you tire of having the same English muffin, egg white, and preternaturally round ham sandwich every morning, you can definitely explore other options. I commanded my servants to toast two frozen waffles, scramble an egg and heat up a turkey sausage patty for me and that was utterly refreshing. Perhaps in the future I will command them to toast a croissant, soft-poach an egg and steam a link of boudin blanc. Then I will dine like the classy Parisian princesse that I am, mon amie!
