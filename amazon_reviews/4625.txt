Great product, easy to set up & use
We bought one of these for ourselves, then got one for my parents for Christmas. Most of my experience is with the one we bought my Mom & Dad. I helped them set up Netflix on it, and it's easy to do and works great! They have an older TV and I was pleased that this BluRay player has the standard RCA output to connect to those older models without having to daisy-chain different adapters. We did have to call Samsung customer service for a Netflix issue (that turned out to not actually be a Netflix issue) and I was not overly enthralled with them. I had to make two separate calls because the first person I talked to didn't follow-thru on the completion of a task and wouldn't stay on the phone with me long enough to make sure the issue was resolved. Other than that, this is a great item and we are pleased to have one at our house and at my Mom & Dad's.
