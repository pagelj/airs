Best of the best in the market.
My friend bought 1, then I bought 2 for myself, then I bought 2 more for my family. It's robust, compact, suction is 500% better than all the others and it doesn't look like a tarantula spider just landed on your windshield... although don't be afraid if a spider lands on your windshield, it might just save your life. Great job iOttie. With great reviews, come great honesty.
