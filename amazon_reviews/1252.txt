Just received my second one. The first one died a death from ingesting too much hair in the motor from my long-haired cat, but this was 4 or 5 years later. It performed greatly for all those years. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great, corded hand vac. The cord is plenty long to reach anything in your house or, I would imagine, in a vehicle. It's a bit on the heavy side, but that has not been a bother to me.
