In a very confusing world of espresso/cappuccino makers, this is a solid buy. I read tons of reviews, and based on those, I chose this machine for these reasons:1. Powerful steam feature. Most reviews pointed toward this as an important feature, and this machine has a pump to create powerful steam.2. Short "warm-up" period. Many machines that are powerful take a long time to warm up. I turn this on, and by the time I've gathered my ingredients, it's ready to go.3. A standard-size coffee cup fits under the drip spout. Those were the reasons I purchased it.  I discovered several other nice features after buying it.1. It's very easy to use. The manual itself is helpful, and the instructions are easy to do. My 9-year-old son regularly makes me lattes with this machine.2. Even though it's tall enough to fit a standard mug, it's not bulky or oversized.3. Everything except the frothing wand is easy to clean.4. It's very economical. I'm really trying to think of any "cons," and the only ones I can come up with are:1. You don't get any accessories with it (except the tamper), but then, most of the machines don't come with those anyway.2. Although a standard coffee mug will fit under the spout, novelty mugs that are just a little taller won't. Other reviews say that they've had problems with leaks. I haven't. A hint if you purchase this machine: the manual says that, to clean the frothing wand, hold a cup of water under it and steam the water. I've found this isn't really sufficient. But we keep a clean toothbrush near the machine, and if you scrub the frother a little WHILE steaming the water, it comes clean quite well. Allthe other parts remove easily to be washed. I definitely recommend this machine.
