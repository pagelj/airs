pleasntly surprised
Bought this as a gift my my soon to be 17 yr old sister. She wanted a brown crossbody with the chain strap detail. I saw that is was "inspired" by chanel designs but WHOA was I surprised that QUALITY was apparently also taken in account when creating this bag. The leather is super soft and thick and it looks like a very expensive bag! So at this price it is ABSOLUTELY worth it! I chose the brown bag because she was wanting a brown purse, but would seriously consider getting it again in another color for myself. Get it is is awesome!!!!
