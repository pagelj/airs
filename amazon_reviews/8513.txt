What do you expect for $25
Look..... it works just fine and once you deduct the cost of an HDMI cable,it doesn't cost more than it's weight in scrap metal! It's a little crude but my biggest problem with it is that it is very difficult to screw in the safety lock screws from underneath and also there are no knobs on the tilt adjustment so you have to use a socket with a long extension. This mount needs a lot of space either side and underneath. VideoSecu.... Make it a few bucks more but make it more user friendly!!
