Start your day right with protein
My fiance and I bought ours maybe 6 months ago and we love it.  He does the whole egg-sausage-muffin-cheese thing a few times a week.  He's an early morning commuter, so he sets it to cook while he takes a quick shower and then wraps it in some wax paper to take with him on the drive.  Mind you, if you multi-task while its cooking, you better like your egg well-done because it does keep cooking in the steam after the toaster turns off. Myself, I do everything but the sausage.  I think it makes a fairly healthy breakfast if you eat some fruit on the side.  I like my yolk soft and gooey, so I'm there as soon as it's done.  It's always hot enough to melt the cheese I put on top, too. Somebody commented that you can't do two eggs in a row, but I've done it many times right after my fiance. It's not the best toaster, but if you keep the setting between Low and Med-low it comes out alright.
