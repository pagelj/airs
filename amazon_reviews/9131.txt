A Dance with Shaggy Dogs
Spoilers Ahead:  We end the last book almost at war with Meereen, a war we need to see fought to get Daenerys closer to Westeros and closer to a possible end to the series.  A thousand pages later, we're almost at war with Meereen.  This pretty much sums up how far all the plot lines go in this book.  Perhaps the most frustrating and obvious of the shaggy dog plot lines  is Tyrion.  He begins the book on his way to meet Daenerys, which will actually be interesting - and after a thousand pages - he's become a slave, broken away, become a mercenary and aided young Griff.  All of which might be interesting if this were book one, but all I want to see at this point is him meet Daenerys.  Really, would that have been too much?  On page 500?  Too Soon?  Nope, we'll save that for Book 6.  And young Griff?  He's a plot line introduced 4500 pages into the story and now becomes yet another obstacle to an ending.  We didn't even see Sansa in this book so we'll probably get 500 pages of Sansa and Littlefinger see-sawing in the Vale in Book 6.  Who cares?  And for those folks who demand to know why I kept reading if I was so annoyed, I kept reading because I'd already delved into 4000 pages and was hoping it was moving toward a conclusion since Martin pondered over this book for so long.  Not to mention the fact that Martin is a great writer.  His prose sucks you in, he wields suspense like Valyrian steel and his characters are deep.  Yet, all I felt at the end of this book was disappointment.  Great writer or not, his name should not be mentioned in the same breath as Tolkein.  Tolkein managed to tell a better story, in a deeper world using a third of the pages.  Heck, I actually liked "Feast," but at this point, I honestly don't know if I'll pick up book 6. The only thing of significance in Dance happened at the very end when Jon Snow takes a knife in the back, ironically similar to the one Martin keeps twisting in mine.
