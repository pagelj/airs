I was hesitant to buy this coffee maker due to the poor reviews on here, but Im glad I did. It hasnt leaked once for me, but maybe its because I place the water arm over the basket before I close the lid. Its perfect for me, as Im the only coffee drinker in our family. I program it to turn on and be ready 5 mins before I walk out the door. I find its too hot to drink right after brewing, but when I do get around to drinking it 15-20 mins later its the perfect drinking temp, if not still a little warm. I use a 20-oz insulated travel mug, not a ceramic cup, I dont know if that makes a difference in final temp of the coffee. Its easy to clean, compact and simple to use! I would highly recommend this coffee maker, after the side note of making sure the water arm is in place before closing the lid.
