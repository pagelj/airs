Massively Entertaining
I was seriously impressed with the novel I read by Mark Whiteway. This book (the sea of Storms) and the exceptional story really won me over. At the beginning of the story, I really find it hard to recognize and familiarize myself with the characters. However, at the latter part, I can understand the story and the plot as well.  "The sea of storms" is an incredibly inviting read that manages to ask some big questions in an off-the-wall manner and with such effortless charisma that reading the book is a real joy. I realized that in almost every way, mission seems to hold untold dangers and lethal encounters. It is one of those you just can't let go until you have finished it, demanding your undivided attention. If you have ever been a fan of any sci-fi movie/book, then you will love this on any of the many levels - even if you aren't but have seen a few episodes you can relate too much of the story. The characters are entertaining and the pace is set just right. From reading this book, I can say that the story is ultimately rewarding and massively entertaining.
