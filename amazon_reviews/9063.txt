Very happy with the videos
I'm very happy with the videos this pocket point-n-shot camera produces. This is the first pocket camera I've owned that lets you zoom when recording video. That's nice. I'm happy with the time the battery holds a charge. Still images are a nice quality. The optical zoom is great. The only thing I don't like is the toggle on/off switch. I abuse pocket cameras and I'm guessing the switch will be the first thing to break. We'll see.
