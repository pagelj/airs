Nearly perfect, but for one flaw..
This is a great bag and will be replacing the Canon holster bag I bought just last week. Some of the reviews are all over the place regarding size, but for me it's perfect.  I can fit my T3i WITH the kit lens attached, a 300mm zoom lens, a prime lens, the charger, the user's manual, and a host of smaller items in the bag (including a little point and shoot).  I had to reconfigure the hook and loop dividers, but everything now has a home, with the lenses and the point and shoot each residing within their own padded cubicles and I don't have to jam anything in there to get things to fit. There's one issue I think is kind of serious though and it's been brought up in many other reviews.  The top flap of the bag is secured with the two clips, and that's it.  You had better be mindful of the state of those clips when you grab the top handle because if they're undone, the body of the bag will swivel out from underneath you, and there goes $1000+ worth of equipment spilling onto the floor.  It happened to me while I was initially packing it, but luckily just the charger and a couple cleaning pens were in there at the time.  Yikes.  I'll be sewing some velcro up in there and I will be double checking that the clips are secure from now on. Aside from that, the bag is just perfect for me and my (limited) equipment.  I'll use the holster bag I just bought every now and then but this will be the go-to bag for most occasions.
