Easy to Use, a Lot of Stored Power
How often have you found yourself with a low battery, on the run and no way to power up. I've done it and the feeling of panic is not good. This power bank is a great way to get the juice you need for your electronic devices. The RAVPower Dynamo-On-the-Go power bank is packed with a ton of back-up power. It takes quite awhile to charge but using the AC adapter instead of USB to computer plug is faster (all are provided). The unit has two cables and two USB ports for charging two items at a time. The end of each cable is a micro USB plug. The instructions state that if you have a device with a different charging port, you can use your own USB cable with the correct end plug to your device. This is actually nice for me because most of my devices are micro USB so I only have what I need. I don't have a bunch of extra plugs hanging around. The power bank charged up my Droid Incredible 4G easily and also a completely drained Kindle Fire. It still had one (out of four) power bars left so I still had juice left over. I'm not an expert on power levels so I can't translate that to how much power was exchanged. The power bank comes with a velvety bag that easily holds your unit, cables, and AC plug. Some power banks have a built in light but this does not. Not a huge detractor but just to note the difference. With all the power outages on the east coast this past month, having an emergency back-up could be the difference in calling for help when you need it. Definitely something to keep on hand and charged up. I was provided a unit by Sunvalleytek for evaluation and unbiased review.
