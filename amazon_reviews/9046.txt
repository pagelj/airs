I was very nervous about buying such an inexpensive espresso machine, but was convinced by all the great reviews here.  I was not disappointed!  This machine paid for itself in about a week and makes delicious lattes!  Don't bother buying a tamper or a milk jug, a mug and the coffee scoop/tamper that are included with the machine work just perfectly. Tip: After steaming the milk clean the milk steaming part of the machine IMMEDIATELY with a wet rag.  Makes cleaning the machine a cinch as well. Can't say enough good things about this machine.
