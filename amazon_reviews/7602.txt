It's alright
Game wise this is a, relatively, fun game and something you should at least try if you're a fan of the showP - This game keeps a nice atmosphere similar to the shows with all the ponies running around and playing with each other, the design of the ponies and buildings is nicely done, it's cool that they've thrown in a few of the 'fan-made' ponies, like Derpy or Doctor Whooves, and it's very nice that there's official voice acting for it as well, even if it's only for a few of them. C - There are a few things that aren't particularly great about this game, what game doesn't have a few cons?, but they're nothing that will really bother you and you can overlook them pretty easily, the design of Luna or some of the dialogue for instance, however there are a number of things that can't be overlooked as easily such as ; the cost of certain things being ridiculously high, Celestia, Shining Armor, Cadance and the hospital for instance,  along with the fact that you cannot complete the game without having to spend the gems that take forever to get a substantial amount of or that shutting down the game, even for a few minutes, causes you to be punished the next time you pop in with Parasprites and boulders suddenly appearing that cost precious money and Harmony Shards to remove. While those are very annoying they can be overlooked because of the nature of the game however the one big thing that I cannot overlook is the fact that it is a very heavy freemium game, does pretty much everything it can to make it hard for you thus making you buy a gem or coin pack from them, and the prices for them are ridiculous, and the only real way to progress later in the game is to use your gems which means spending tons of money or just finding cheats, which there are plentu of. One last kind of big con is that you need Hearts for certain quests and the only way to get them is through friends leaving chests or sending gifts to you and this is pretty difficult since their friends list is always having some sort of issue. Overall - This could've been way better than what it is but it's still worth playing a bit before the later parts where it becomes impossible to play without cheats or wasting tons of real money on gems due to the 'freemium' business model that everyone seems to be doing.
