Good device at a good price
I bought this for my wife after her old Windows Vista laptop died. This thing is really lightweight, thin and attractive. The screen is bright and clear and the keyboard is nice and responsive. The battery life isn't amazing, but in my experience it does last the advertised 6.5 hours or more depending on what you are doing. It's extremely fast to boot up and resume from sleep. My only real complaint is the low quality speakers. They sound very tinny especially on the high notes. My wife is a light user and she loves it. She uses it mostly for basic web surfing and watching Netflix. There are of course a few limitations that many others have pointed out, but if you know what you getting it is a great device at a really nice price.
