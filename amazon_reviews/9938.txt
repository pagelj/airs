dont buy
i previously had the same otterbox i bought from the store but i broke it taking it off so i bought this one. Its different the screen is from a different material and gives you a bunch of bubbles. i bought another one from the store because i was so annoyed at the bubbles and the one from the store works perfectly no bubbles at all. dont waste your money. eventhough it is in the original packaging i dont think its real!!
