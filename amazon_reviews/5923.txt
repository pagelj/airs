Pretty slick little (or not quite so little) toaster!
We were intrigued by the extended functionality of this toaster, and with the many positive reviews we decided to give it a try. So far (after a few uses) it seems to be living up to the expectations, and we are pleased. As noted by some other reviewers there is a smell of plastic on the first use or two. Other than this we are quite happy with the product and its many features. If you're looking for a 'do it all' toaster this one is tough to beat.
