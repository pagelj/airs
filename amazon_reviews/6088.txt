Overall, this products delivers on the promise of portable power
I own many smart devices and have always been troubled by the battery performance across most of my devices. I purchased the IMP120D after reading about the many positive experiences others were having. All in all, I love this device and think that it delivers on the promise of portable power. If there was any "cons" to this device, I would say that they should include additional or different cables with these devices such as the iPad charging cable, a micro and mini USB cable, etc. That said, I love this device and think they are fantastic for anyone with smart devices or other portable electronics given that batteries are not very long-lasting and reliable always. Also, I like the inclusion of the wall charger for the IMP120D vs. having to charge it via the USB port of a laptop/computer.
