Great Teen Dystopian Novel
Wow, this was such a great read. It was the perfect dystopian teen novel. The novel is fast paced and I found myself flipping pages as fast as I could because I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The characters are intriguing. Tris, the main character, is a combination of Katniss from The Hunger Games and Tally from Uglies. I enjoyed how Tris came to terms with herself over the course of the novel. Four is also a great character. I found him sexy, interesting and odd. Divergent is a coming of age story set in a dystopian society. I didn't expect to enjoy Divergent. I thought it would be a Hunger Games rip off but it's deinitely not. Divergent comes from the same vein as The Hunger Games but is able to make a space for itself in the dystopian genre without stepping on anyone's toes.
