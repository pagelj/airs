Very low quality - avoid this product
I was cautiously optimistic because it had the Belkin name, but I now know that Belkin should stick to making electronic components. Within the first week, the external zipper started sticking. Within the first month, the right strap starting coming apart, and now the foam insert is showing through a 2-inch gap, with little threads sticking out all over. Recently, the external zipper broke off altogether. I do not overload it.  In fact, I've never had more inside than the laptop and a few file folders. I will be buying a new backpack, and avoiding Belkin.
