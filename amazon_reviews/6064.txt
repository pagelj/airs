Works as advertised
It works, but it is pretty difficult to get the battery in to the charger. On the Galaxy Nexus, the battery needs to be off to the side and you need to look carefully at the positive and negative traces to line them up.  I understand that a universal charger isn't going to fit like a glove, but this is a little rough. That being said, it works as advertised.
