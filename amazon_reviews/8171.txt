I received this toaster as a wedding shower present, I loved it at first.  We could make the egg sandwiches you buy at fast food places, healthier and cheaper.  It was wonderful. Problem is, the toaster one day died.  Nothing on it worked, the computer was done.  I tried contacting the company only to find out that the email they list on their site is no longer valid and the phone number gets you no where.  We ended up throwing this thing out just under a year of owning it. I almost bought another one thinking it was a fluke but then read the reviews of some other people and found out it was a common problem.  Some people had bought two and had both of them die.  I will never buy this again because it didn't last long enough and the company doesn't seem to care.
