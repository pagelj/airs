Great affordable filter!
This is a great cheap filter to use on any 67mm lens. It is very clear, you will notice absolutely no change in your image quality, except for the fact that it protects your lens of UV rays, which is a great investment if your lenses are expensive. Also, if you use your camera a little on the crazy side, or are somewhat clumsy, this could help protect your lens glass if you accidentally hit it against a hard surface. This way only the filter breaks, and you still have a pristine lens!
