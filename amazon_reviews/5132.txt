Can't beat the price!
Having a hard time with this unit & all of the quirks.  For the money, you can't beat the price for a double-din with GPS.  I bought used from Amazon Warehouse & the 1st unit did not include the GPS sdcard.  Also, the ipod connector did not work.  After returning, the 2nd unit also did not include the sdcard.  However, I was able to download the map software & updates without much problem. Had to trim my dash piece for it to fit, but am a bit sorry I did because now I'm stuck with the unit. Some issues I am still having:Ipod classic will only connect with the ipod cable when the ipod classic is 1st restarted.  Also, it does not charge the ipod.  My iphone 4 charges no problem. When I make a call from the head unit, it does not dial the number.  it dials whatever label i have for my contact - for a mobile number it will dial 662458... no clue. Can not for the life of me get the steering wheel controls to work.  Has anyone? Also can not change to a custom background.  Tried images from an sdcard & a USB stick. Was able to turn off the volume starting at 10 all the time by pressing on the clock for a couple of seconds & deselecting the volume memory option.
