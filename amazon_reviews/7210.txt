Excellent features
I bought my first Blu-ray (not on Amazon) for Skype, Netflix,  and the price. I have not played a Blu-ray disc yet so no comment there. Just one small note on accessing Netflix for the first time. I actually thought my first player was defective and returned it because I couldn't enter my e-mail address in Netflix. All the other items in Viera Cast were very easy to access. After receiving the second one Netflix was very helpful (this blu-ray player wasn't in the system the first time I called.) For those of you that had trouble gaining access to Netflix you need to click the OK button on the remote to pull up the Netflix entry screen. I hope that saves someone the trouble I had setting up Netflix. Wireless setup is a breeze. If you have Norton AV and want to setup your Home Network and access DLNA I had trouble setting that up.  Two other minor things so far. There's no back button on the remote that I know about to delete character entry (I would love to be wrong on that point). There is also no subtitle button on the remote. I will add further thoughts after using more of the features. I'm very excited to use Skype on the big screen.
