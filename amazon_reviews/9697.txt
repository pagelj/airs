Great streaming box
I ordered a Roku 3 (from Roku directly since its not in stock at amazon) and received it yesterday. I have had it close to 24 hours now and I can tell you it's definitely worth it if you are a Netflix and Amazon Prime member. The Roku 3 is much faster than its predecessor and the interface has been improved greatly. It is much easier to use and everything is fast and responsive (finally). The Roku 3 packs a faster processor that really helped speed things up. A new feature to the Roku 3 is a headphone jack in the remote which comes in handy when you have people sleeping in the house and you don't want to wake them up. This also comes in handy for the Music channels on Roku. You can walk around the house and listen to your music. The Roku 3 comes with a set of headphones to use with this function that actually aren't bad, but you can use your own as well. The remote on the Roku 3 uses wifi to connect to the box so you don't need to have line of sight with the box for the remote to work. This means you can hide the Roku box somewhere out of sight and the remote will still function perfectly. The back of the Roku 3 has an Ethernet port, HDMI output, microSD slot, and power plug. There's also a USB port on the side, which can be used for playing back digital media files. If your TV doesn't have an HDMI port, you will have to go with the Roku LT, Roku HD or Roku 2 XD instead.

Roku has much more content than Apple TV does.
