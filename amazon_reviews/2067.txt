long lasting backup
Review for IMP120D, iCarrier, a dual port external batteryThis unit is extremely versatile given it has 2 ports and a massive battery. Charging all my devices was not issue. I was able to full charge my iPad (twice)and Samsung SG3 fully and the unit is still on medium power remaining. ProsLarge capacity battery2 usb portsCharges devices quicklyConsSize - to be expected given its battery size. You are not buying a unit with size battery for its small foot printAnother charging adapter - didn't like carrying another adapter to charge the unit. I like the battery packs that use a usb cab;e to recharge. According to power adapter, it is 5v, 2A. This can be done with an adapter using a usb cable, then that adapter can be used as your overnight device charger as well. Another thing to carry while traveling is a negativePower on/off button - should power the device as soon as you plug it in. Overall I am extremely happy with this charger and plan to use it as my primary backup charging device4 out of 5 stars - 1 star less because of the additional power charger needed.
