Great 300mm lens - hand held
This is a great lens for outdoor sports or wildlife photography.  You can make sharp handheld photos at 300mm.  I took several photos at Disney on the safari ride (from a bouncy truck) at 150-300mm ... and they came out sharp enough to print at 8x10 and frame.  (My wife hung them in the living room, so they have to look pretty good).  Probably not the best for low light ... need $$ fast glass for that.
