Holds a lot of pictures
I bought this sandisk SDHC card for my panasonic lumix camera. This card works well in my camera, holds up to 1000 pictures and 500 hours of video time. I have had no promblem with this memory card if any of my devices that put it in. I works great in my kindle, camcorder and computer. I will recommend this product to anybody who is looking for a great memory card, with a great price.
