nice but.....
Love the knives, but be careful.  I thought that the block had a knife for each of it's slots. Not so.  I did receive all of the knives it claimed to include but there are still some empty slots that need to be filled.  SO! That means I have to go and buy a few more in order to complete the set. Bummer.  Oh well. no big deal, I guess.
