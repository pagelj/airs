Great Pleasure
I would recommend this movie to all, There is so much happening that its hard to stay focus on one item. Story is magnificent with a lot of talent to go with it. Something very different to the every day show and any age would show delight in watching, with unusual figures of the past, Figures of the very near future, Special effects are fantastic with the colors meeting and mixing  with one another. Movie is a must see, one you can watch several times and still enjoy. So what are you waiting for, grab your goodies sit and relax, so put your feet up while watching the marvelous entertainment before your eyes, you wont be sorry.
