Saved me $80 the first time used!
Most of my sewist friends have an attachment set like this, and I finally bought this one. The day before it arrived, my computerized sewing machine "ate" a piece of knit fabric. It was lodged behind the bobbin case, beyond the reach of my tiniest crochet hook or tweezers. Unless I got it out, I was facing a trip to the repairman. When the attachment kit arrived, I assembled the tiny crevice tool, hoping it would do the trick. Almost instantly, a thread attached to the lost fabric piece was sucked up so I could grasp it with tweezers. A gentle tug pulled the fabric free, and I was back in business! I would give this product five stars if the adapter would completely seal against the hose. As it is, the user can control the seal (greater/lesser suction)... up to a point. It will not close completely. There may be a reason for this, but I would like to have access to the full power of my vacuum cleaner, if I think I need it.
