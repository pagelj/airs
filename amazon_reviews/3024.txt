Shuts down the internet for all other PCs
I'm an Apple share holder but I have to admit I didn't expect what happened when I hooked it up. Homeshare worked wirelessly between my Windows 7 PC with iTunes and the Apple TV. But guess what? The internet shuts down for all the PCs, including the one I have iTunes on. And it's not easy to get it going again. After Googling it, it appears that a lot of other people have the same problem. It has something to do with my router which is a Linksys WRT54G and the IP address. You know what, it should be plug-n-play and it isn't in my case, and I'm not an Apple geek who prefers to spend his life trying to fix what shouldn't need fixing. I suspect if you have a Mac or iPad you won't have this problem, but if you have what I have, you probably will be unhappy. On the plus side, playing your iTunes content through the system or ordering content through Netflix, etc., is very cool. It is the future so I'll keep it and wait until I have a day to fix what shouldn't have to be fixed.
