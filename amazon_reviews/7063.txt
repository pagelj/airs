Excellent device...
I purchased this tablet with second thoughts thinking I didn't "need" a tablet, as my smart phone and laptop are excellent.  After much pondering, I purchased it.  I absolutely love it!  The browser is much faster than I expected and the visual quality of the pics and videos are much better than I expected.  This device is axiomatic for most people probably, with not much use for the user manual.  I looked at the manual after I had used it all day and already had it set up like I wanted it with apps, icons on the screens, etc.  The battery life is better than I expected.  I often checked the battery level after watching a Netflix movie and found only about 10-12% drain on the battery level. I would recommend getting a stand and a nice case for it.  The stand so you are less likely to drop it and the case so if you do drop it, it hopefully will protect it.  It is very easy to slip out of your hands, so be careful.  I'm still looking for a rubberized perimeter protector for it and haven't located on yet.  Buy a micro SD card too for extra space.  I bought a 16 GB to go with mine. I have noticed that I use my laptop less now, so that will extend the life of my laptop hopefully.  Facebook, e-mail, weather, and reading news is a very nice experience on this device.  I got the 7 inch one instead the 10 inch.  I held the 10 inch and it just seemed too big to be convenient.  I have no regrets with the 7 inch. It is large enough for ease of use, but not too big for a bulky experience.  I hope this is helpful.
