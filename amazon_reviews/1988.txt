Excellent Backpack
I've owned this backpack for about 8 weeks now and have zero regrets. I've had that thing so cram-packed full of junk I was worried it would just explode.  In fact, the 1st time I filled it up and slung it around to my back, I honestly think I heard a few stitches pop.  I thought, oh jeez, here we go.  Nope, it just must have been stretching out or something, because it has performed flawlessly. It has a tremendous amount of space, lots of places to organize your stuff, and is super comfortable to wear. I expect this backpack to last me several years, and will definitely purchase another High Sierra in the future.
