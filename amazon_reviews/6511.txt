Camera works fine but hard to attach
Camera works fine and picture quality is very good but it will not attach firmly to the PC screen.  I have to tape it to the back of the screen which seems rather strange.  However, I suspect it must work with a number if different PC screens so I guess it must be flexable enough to do that.
