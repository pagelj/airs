Good Heinlein Space War Story
I really did feel I was reading another Robert Heinlein novel but that's not a bad thing at all. This was a great mix of story and ideas and technology and it's a book that I think will stick with me. I plan to read the rest of the series now. I would recommend Old Man's War to anyone that has enjoyed reading Heinlein novels and really anyone that enjoys science fiction in general.
