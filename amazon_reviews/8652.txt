Very Nice, but grip extender issue...
Bulldog Nylon Pouch is well made with a strong belt clip and loop... Inside soft lining to protect the finish on your weapon. Finger holes under pouch to push up a small pistol. Note, this pouch is exact fit for the Taurus TCP with a flat base magazine... If you have a grip extender, the pouch flap will not close. You can fit the gun upright... The finger rest of the mag grip extender will be slightly exposed out of the bottom hole. This will allow the flap to close properly providing a snug fit. You will need to practice for a safe reliable draw in this position.
