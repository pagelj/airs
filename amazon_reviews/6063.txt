The Dyson Animal vacuum cleaner is a decent vacuum cleaner, but not worth it for the money.  Yes, the suction is very powerful. We have two Labrador retrievers, so sucking up their fur is important, and this vacuum sucks up just about all of their fur even in carpet. Before I bought the Dyson, I bought a Eureka AirSpeed Upright Vacuum Cleaner for 25% of the price of the Dyson Animal.  The Eureka has comparable suction, works just as well or better in normal use, and has the following items that work better than the Dyson Animal:The Eureka has a brush roller attachment used to clean stairs, which is handheld, about 3 inches wide, and has brushes that spin when attached. This spinning brush roll works great to get fur out of our car, in tight spaces. The Eureka also has (which I would think would be standard), a way to store the power cord just by touching a button and feeding the cord into a hidden spool inside the machine. The Dyson has about the same suction, but it does not have a way to store the power cord on a spool. Setting up the Dyson so I can clean my car involves taking a bunch of parts together. It's always a hassle because of the weird design, where I have to figure out the design all over again every time. After vacuuming, putting the Dyson back together for storage is also a hassle, as I have to laboriously put the parts back together. Having to manually put the cord back on the vacuum is especially irritating. Finally, the brush roll on the Dyson Animal is useless! I'd buy the Eureka over the Dyson again in a heartbeat. The Eureka seems to be as well made, and it performs better than the Dyson. Finally, the Eureka is only 25% of the price of the Dyson! Why buy a Dyson?
