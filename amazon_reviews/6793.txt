My parents had the older model of this coffee maker for quite a while and I loved it. When I got married we had a DeLonghi coffee maker that made a wonderful cup of coffee but it did not grind the beans. Then it broke and we replaced it (very briefly) with a Hamilton Beach coffee maker. I had forgotten what a good brand DeLonghi was and the Hamilton Beach one was on sale and it was red... so like a child I bought it because it was my favorite color. But it was just so cheaply made and had a lot of bizarre warming plate issues (I wrote a review that is on here somewhere. But we quickly realized that our cheap replacement was not going to work out, whether it matched the curtains or not. So I started looking for a grind and brew model that wasn't over 100 dollars and found the very Cuisinart I remembered loving at my parent's house. The price we paid was incredible. It cost less than the DeLonghi had and that one didn't even grind the beans! I see that many people feel the grinder is too loud but it is nowhere near as loud as the ones at most coffee shops and it only takes a few moments to grind the beans, nor is it any louder than my separate coffee grinder. It came with a reusable filter and a replacement water filter (if you what your coffee water filtered, I have no real opinion on that as my city's water tastes great)Anyway, You can also easily switch to the mode for using pre-ground coffee and it has all the other features you'd expect... pause and serve, a 1-4 cup mode so you don't get bitter coffee when making less etc. All in all a great product. And if you price compare you will see what a fantastic deal you are getting as well.
