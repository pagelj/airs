I love this coffee maker! The first cup was a bit weak. I followed another customer's suggestion and pressed down the coffee grounds before turning on the machine. That resulted in a delicious cup of coffee. One problem, I've not been able to adjust the machine's height for short cups. The coffee spatters on the machine. I need to check the product manual.
