Terrific Sci Fi Flick
This movie came out about the same time as Independence Day - and it is MUCH better.  Fantastic plot, fantastic acting, fantastic conspiracy flick ... and pretty good special effects!  You will LOVE this is you are an  X-files fan, Star Trek fan, War of the Worlds fan, or if you're into really  go sci fi movies.  It got 2 thumbs up when it came out, but didn't have the  advertising budget so it didn't get a lot of attention.  But what a  fantastic price!!
