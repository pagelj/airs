So far, great little player
I've only used this player on one trip, but so far so good.  Keep in mind that it is small.  It is not the size of one of the players that you rent from In Motion.  But, little kids don't really care, and its small size makes it easy to toss in your backpack or bag.  And it's very lightweight.  I bought this one because it had a longer battery life than some of the others in this price range.  It charges quickly also.
