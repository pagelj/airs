What? That's it??
I think what threw me off was the number of pages.  It says 200+ but it's actually about 100.  The rest are all snippets of other books.  That being said, the book starts off really good, and you really feel for the heroine.  I even started to tear up, and when it gets deep and interesting, all of a sudden, it ends?!  And I was like, "What just happened??  Huh? Wait, did I miss something here?"I think if she had another 100 pages to fully develop the plot and the conflict, this would have been a 5 star book for sure.  It was disappointing to see it end so abruptly.
