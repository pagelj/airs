Works great, but only because of the easy instructions from previous reviewer!
I am so glad that I printed out the review from the person who wrote detailed instructions on how to use it.  Worked perfect!  Had no problems whatsoever!  Converted all my home VHS tapes over to DVD.  Am very happy with it!
