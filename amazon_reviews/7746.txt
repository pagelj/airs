The Idea of this Coffee maker is great:  Brew a large cup of coffee for one quickly into a travel mug.  The problem is Black and Decker had a very bad design for the filter system.  The coffee grinds in this system almost always overflowed.  This constantly left a mess, not to mention the coffee was worthless because it was full of grounds.  This might be caused partly by the fact that I like using fresh ground beans.  The system might work better if you bought Folgers/Maxwell House/ETC.  Or this product could probably work ok with tea-bag style coffee bags.  I bought this unit for about and it came with two travel mugs.  After trying this unit about 7 times, I think I had about 2 sucessful cups of Coffee.  The unit worked so poorly, I threw it away.
