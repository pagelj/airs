This item was purchased as part of a birthday present for a family member. I knew of it because someone had generously given one to me earlier when they were a lot more expensive.  I have found it to be one of the best small appliances on my counter and my family member says likewise.  The toaster oven is used almost daily for baking, broiling and heating up items which would die in the microwave. (breads, sandwiches, etc.)  I recommend it highly.
