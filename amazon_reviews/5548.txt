Nikon COOLPIX AW100 Leaked the First Time In Water
Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video (Black)Ordered a Nikon COOLPIX AW100 waterproof camera from Amazon for an upcoming snorkeling trip.  Received the camera and spent a few days getting familiar with it.  I thought it would be a good idea to check the camera for "waterproofness", so I submerged it into a bucket of tap water for about 20 minutes.  As soon as I put it in the water, a large bubble of air came from the case, and I thought that was odd.  After 20 minutes, I tried taking a couple of close-up pictures with the camera still in the bucket, and noticed that there were water droplets in the picture!  Took the camera out of the water and there was water inside the front lens, with visible droplets on the inside surface of the lens! After a few minutes, the whole lens fogged up on the inside, making further pictures impossible.  Additional condensation appeared around the edges of the view screen.  I opened up the battery/memory card cover and there was water inside the camera. Before submerging the camera, I visually inspected the seal area on the access cover and everything looked OK.  I made sure the cover was closed and correctly latched.  After the test, knowing that the camera had leaked, I re-inspected the seal area as soon as I opened it, using an illuminated magnifier.  The seal still looked good, and I could not see anything in the seal area to cause a leak. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in this camera, as I was really looking forward to taking some good snorkeling pictures.  Oh well, guess it's back to the old reliable 35mm waterproof cameras.
