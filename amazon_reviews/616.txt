Buy 1 for $15 and lose it, or buy 10 for $3 and have spares?
No brainer for me.  Keep one in my bag, one on my desk, one on my nightstand, one in my car.  Then still have extras to give to those friends who bought that 1 for $15 and lost it.  They are lightweight (one advantage to being 'cheap') and they work perfectly.
