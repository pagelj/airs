POC
No apologies here, this is a POC (Piece 'O Crap) toaster. It has never worked well and over the years, one side of the heating element on each side has taken a sabbatical. If you like your toast, or bagel with one side burnt and one side evenly toasted, this is the machine for you. If not, look elsewhere.
