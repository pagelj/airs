Love the phone!
Great CDMA Network Phone. Love the phone but when tried to put microSDHC the card would not insert. After I got some from my brother and nephew. They got it to go in but it would not read the card they had to pull it out and a green tab came out stuck to it. They pulled it off and put the card back in. It still would not read the card. This time a tab stuck inside the slot they removed the tab. This time the microSDHC slid in effortlessly and read 16 GB microSDHC card and got 14.8 free space.
