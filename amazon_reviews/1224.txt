Great product at an even better price!
To begin with, I am not a handyman by any stretch of the imagination, but I figured I would give mounting this a try.  With a decent stud finder, level, and ratchet I had all the tools I needed.  It went up on the wall very easily, and the TV attached nearly as easily.  I was very impressed with the sturdiness and the ability to adjust the angles.  I attached a 46 inch Sony Bravia TV and have no concerns with it coming down.  As with many of the other comments, I could not believe the price in comparison with other brands (many more than $300)!  I would certainly recommend this product to anybody who might be interested.  The item is not perfect. The instructions are not clear, and it would be nice if some of the hardware was covered better behind the TV, but for the price, and functionality of the object, this is possibly the best deal I have ever found on Amazon!
