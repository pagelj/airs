I know that it sounds silly to get so excited about a garbage can but I looked and looked and looked for a garbage can that would compliment my newly renovated kitchen with all my stainless steel appliances. All the garbage can I found were just tooooo small to hold the amount of garbage my family produces in a week. But, this can!!!! Great looking and great size!
