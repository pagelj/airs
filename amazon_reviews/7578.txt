Dystopian classic
"Fahrenheit 451" is part of the troika of great dystopian novels of the 20th century, along with "1984" and "Brave New World." What makes this book even more disturbing is the seemingly voluntary oppression of ignorance of a fun-seeking society turning fascist from within. Ray Bradbury considered this his only work of science-fiction, where he defines the genre as something that would at some point become possible. Contrary to expectations of self-preventing prophecies, these books are at least as relevant today as they were 50 years ago. We are faced with questions of personal freedom where it interferes with national security. Social media changed and continue to change our private life in a way that lets a handful of companies monitor our every move already. We can find almost any information on the internet which may just cover up the relevant and confirmed facts in favor of those that are spread the fastest - we're happy as long as we are entertained (whatever that means). This book is a great piece of literature that will keep you thinking for a long time after putting it down. There is an afterword and a coda to the story which reveals a little more of Ray Bradbury's own thoughts. For me, this was probably the most controversial part where I was missing a clear distinction between censorship and an editing process. I don't think that minorities threaten the liberty of arts - nor should they - when it comes to civil rights and equality.
