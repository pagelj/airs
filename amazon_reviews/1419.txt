It does what it should do great
This phone is great for the calls and can be used with different carriers in US and overseas. Just switch the SIM card or put another one and go. It is little bit pricey for that basic model. The battery life is great! I haven't charged it for a week and it has full power bar. Luck of camera is minus. It is good to have ability to snap a picture in emergency situation. The phone is luck of some symbols on the keyboard and I still didn't figure out if there is a mode where I can type in symbols that are not available on the keyboard, like percent sign % as example. The phone is very small and very light. Fits in any small pocket which is definitely great plus compare to all these smart phones.
