Best for those who like a light toast
For context, my previous toaster was a Cuisinart which was so absurdly powerful it charred just about everything above setting 2 out of 5. I am not exaggerating. When it came time to buy a replacement I was happy to see my favorite manufacturer Bodum offering a toaster. But I was surprised to encounter the opposite problem. This toaster is actually a little weak. Maybe it was just due to my experience with the Cuisinart; the first few times I used the Bodum toaster I put the setting too low and the bread came out hardly toasted at all. I had to send it through twice, which took a long time and the toast got burnt. Now that I learned the routine, I have just gotten used to setting it stronger than I think I have to, and the toast comes out pretty well. The toaster is consistent, so I can remember in my head what setting is best for a particular loaf. At setting 4 out of 5 it gives what I would call a medium toast on a hefty sourdough bread, so if you prefer a dark toast you may be disappointed. Loses a star for two complaints:- the crust is usually a bit overdone compared to the center of a slice- toaster seems a bit slow, especially for higher settingsI am also tempted to knock off a star for the giant "bodum" inscribed on the side--I hate obvious branding like that--but I'll let it slide because the toaster works great overall and is a pleasure to use. I'll repeat what others have said about the product photo color; the red photo shown is way too pink, mine looks more orangey-brick-red.
