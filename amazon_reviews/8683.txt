Really a great product.  We didn't really have room for 2 bins and wanted something that looked nice, but most of the dual ones we've seen were much smaller and more expensive.  Regular 13 gallon bags work great, and no problems with the sensor or lid.  It can be a bit of a pain to replace the bags, but well worth the effort.
