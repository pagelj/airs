We've been very happy with this vacuum so far.  It isn't perfect but solidly built, and functions well.  It's nice to not have to mess with bags but you have to expect to get dirty to empty the chamber of dirt.  Suction is adequate but isn't exceptional.  There are bristles on the sides of the suction opening which grab filth but often don't let go and ends up dragging it around instead of sucking it up.  The wheels roll well and smoothly on hardwood.  The vacuum runs fairly quietly but if something hard is sucked into the cyclone chamber, it makes a louder noise.  These are the nit-picky things, but again, we are happy with it and it works well.  We where afraid to step up to the over-$100 vacuums but discovered we'd have to to get better quality and we don't regret it.
