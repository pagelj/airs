I needed a small vacuum cleaner for pet fur and bought (Nov 2011) this little guy as an alternative to a more costly Dyson hand-held. I have had a Dyson upright for 9 years and just love it. The Good:  It works beautifully in cleaning up animal hair, tiny areas around dresser legs, corners, along baseboards, carpeted stairs.  Fabulous job. I was very pleased. The Bad:  It clogged itself up within a couple of minutes.  At first I wasn't alarmed, I KNEW there was a lot of fur accumulated in these areas, but I had done only one corner and one leg, and had to already empty the thing.  But when I removed the dust cap, there was not much dirt, only fur interlaced with dust matted to the filter!  I had to peel the fur off while trying to keep the dust from coating everything in a 3-foot radius, and I could not get it all off the filter. The Ugly:  I also noticed that after one use the filter was now solid gray with dirt that could not be removed without washing.  The instructions say you can wash the dust bin but not the filter.  This is kind of crazy since there was no dust in the dust bin, it was all matted up with the fur on the filter. It is pretty obvious this filter is not going to last long doing it's "filtering" thing Is it possible Eureka intends the consumer to buy replacement filters beyond the cost of a Dyson hand-held? I noticed that there is a plastic-washable filter on the market.  That particular filter should come with the cleaner as standard equipment and not be a secondary purchase.
