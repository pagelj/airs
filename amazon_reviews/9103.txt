After reading reviews and seeing that Consumer Reports rated this so high, I went for it. Now I wish I had not. Nothing at all has broken and the vacuum works, there are just some major design flaws that I cannot believe made it to the consumer market. Pros1) Oh man is this thing powerful. It sucks up everything. Cons1) You cannot switch from floor to carpet if until you stand it upright and then bend over and make the adjustment. There should be a way to adjust this on the handle and not on the front base of the machine. If you have hardwoods with area rugs, do not buy this vacuum.2) When the bag is full, you get no light. Okay, not so big of a deal. However, it absolutely sounds like it is working, but picks up nothing and just spreads it around on the ground. Just be aware of this and check the bag more often.3) The loudness of this is crazy. I guess it is a trad off with the suction power, but it dirves me crazy and I am typically not bothered at all about loud appliances, TVs, cars, etc. Overall, I just wish someone would have written how cumbersome it is to switch from floor to carpet would be. I knew in advance that if you have the carpet setting on when doing hardwoods you would not be able to vacuum up much, but it just is not worth the pain anymore. Time for this item to be taken to Goodwill.
