how do you adjust the brightness and contrast on this????  Cant find it in the manuel.
pretty good dvd player for the money.  like the remote---but cant figure out how to change brightness.  Mostly is a bit too dark.  also would like to be able to change contrast. PURCHASED AT AMAZON--LIKE MOST THINGS I BUY.
