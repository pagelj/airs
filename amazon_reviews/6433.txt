A great mini.
This is great mini. I love the Chrome handling. I have it on my dell and they work back and forth. I can put some items on this and pick it up on my dell. I was able to move all my favorites or bookmarks from the dell to the Chromebook. I am still learning to use it after having it about two months. The max  battery is about 7 1/2 hours. I did pay a little more than what it is listed for today. I am having much fun using it. There is a small book to get started. I ordered a kindle book that has all the bells and whisles that someone has written. This is my first review. It was purchased from Amazon. My wife has a Kindle and most of my purchases from Amazon are for her ebooks.
