Blu Ray OK but streaming . . .
This is a pretty decent Blu Ray player. Setup is a bit cumbersome and time consuming. If you are hooking up to a wireless system, as I did, it takes a few minutes to locate the system and you better know where the WPS button is on your router or you will be frustrated as the device might not find the network.  Then the first thing it wants to do is a software update and that can take about ten minutes.  And of course you then have to sign into your individual accounts, Netflix etc., and create a Sony account. Then you discover that Netflix and Hulu do not run in HD. Netflix and Hulu stream but when I stream them through my Roku, the shows are in HD.  If I stream through this player, the shows do not stream in HD.  So this will not replace the Roku box.
