Works great
I had this same toaster in red for almost six years and it worked great.  It would still be working great if it hadn't been lost in a fire that destroyed our home/business on Christmas Eve of 2012.  (not caused by the toaster.  :)It would have earned five stars except for the fact that it has a bagel setting, but bagels are too big to fit in the slots and get stuck to the sides.  I unplug and pull it out with a knife, but wish I didn't have to do that.  ZAP!  if I forget and I am likely to forget.
