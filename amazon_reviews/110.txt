The hose will stretch a long way without tipping - UNTIL you turn it on.  It has incredible suction and will suck the attachment so tight that you can't reach out and clean anything.  I had to physically lift the machine to clean cobwebs from my blinds.  And then I still couldn't reach it without getting the extension from my old dead vacuum.  This only comes with one short little wand, a teeny little crevice tool and a rubber pet hair tool.  The rotating little beater comes to a dead standstill once you actually touch anything.  It can really clean the dirt out of the carpet - if that's all you want to do.  If it sits in one place more than a few seconds, it will unravel your carpet and fray it.  I tried the pedal that "disengages the beater" to try to avoid this and began to notice a burning smell.  Each time you try to stretch the hose out, the beater would begin to spin again and burn against the locked belt.  It's too cheaply made to handle its own suction.  (Oh, and the container does not empty easily.  I had to reach in and remove the fur balls that hang up on the inside rim.)  I'm taking it back!!
