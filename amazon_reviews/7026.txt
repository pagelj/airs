beautiful, creative, disturbing, intelligent...
The Hyperion Cantos is huge and challenging to read, but not easy to put down either. From the first chapter of Hyperion when the structure of the story reveals itself mirroring the Canterbury Tales, I was drawn in. Simmons' universe isn't a dreamy world I'd wish to visit, but it is compellingly drawn. The literary, religious and philosopical references are so huge, I know I probably only "got" a tenth of them, but I loved it. And the rest of the Cantos.
