Toshiba laptop equals happiness
I love the laptop. I bought a this laptop because I had ordered one for myself fo rschool. I was very upset with my mom's DELL laptop. She had to send it in twice to get repaired, and still not fix the problem. It was cheaper and easier to buy a new/nicer computer than fix the crappy DELL. Dell has gone down hill since they have been around. I bought this computer for my mom's birthday gift. She was very happy with her gift. Thank You So Much,  Lisa Camarena
