Good but...
I love that you can only put just so much stuff in the blender, so it keeps the amount made down a lot from a conventional blender.  But, I have a few issues with this.  First,  you have to stand there and hold the button the entire time.  If you let go, the blender stops.  Also, although it has done a decent job of making the smoothies with frozen fruit (I cut the pieces up small.  And I also use mini ice cubes made with the FABULOUS ice cube trays (Arrow Plastic 00055 Ice Cube Trays), it feels like at any moment the motor is going to give out.  And I keep having to shake the blender and stick spoons in it so that the fruit continues to be blended.  I think the problem is it just is not strong like a normal blender. I love that it is small and takes up WAY less space than a regular blender.  The container is plastic. The blade is metal.  Oh, the other thing that I don't love is that the bottom piece with the blade doesn't seem to unscrew off.  So, it is hard to clean.  If you happen to leave it in your sink and rush out the door without filling it with water, I don't know  how you would ever get the area by the blades clean. I thought it would someone I could have in my little apartment instead of a full size blender but unfortunately, I think I am still going to have to buy a full size blender too.
