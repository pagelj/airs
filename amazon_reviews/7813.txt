Excellent Batteries
My search for a good rechargeable battery ended quickly after finding these.  I have purchased many packs over the past couple years to satisfy and endless need for juice.  Both brand new packs and older, used sets still charge and work beautifully.  I have actually seen these charge up to 2400 mah or so, well above the rated 1900.  These last long in Leapster Explorer and various other applications.  I cannot recommend these enough.
