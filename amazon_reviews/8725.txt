Meets Our Needs
Very satisfied with this Panasonic cordless phone. After charging, preference setup was simple and quick. We are enjoying the cellular phone and Bluetooth headset link features and regularly use our cellular phone's long distance for out-of-area calls. We are very satisfied with the clarity of voice for both sender and receiver as it is clear and loud. This was a good purchase for our needs.
