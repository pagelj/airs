I returned the camera
I liked the camera at first, but the lens cap stopped functioning... and the camera didn't recognize the new chip even after it was reformatted, so it wouldn't take photos. What use is a camaera that won't take photos? Canon offered to repair it. I returned it to Amazon. I didn't want to pay full price for a repaired item.
