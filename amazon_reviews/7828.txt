Perfect for using as a Baby Monitor
I tried the D-link before this due to the D-link being Wireless-N compatible and the Foscam being only Wireless-G. Using this as a Baby monitor I was worried about video lag. Turned out the D-link had a severe lag when using the d-link app and seemed very buggy so I got the foscam. Lag is very little ( same as any baby monitor 1-2 sec) and it has pan and tilt which comes in handy. Very happy with this product. Wish I would of gotten this one when my son was born instead of a Baby Monitor that was overpriced just because it was labeled a baby monitor. Much better picture quality and features for the price.
