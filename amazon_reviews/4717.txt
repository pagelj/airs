Bravo!
Whoever wrote the script and cast the actors for the voices knew what they were doing when this movie was concieved. It has some classic lines that will stay with you long after your viewing. In the old cliche' reviews: It made me laugh, it made me cry" It's definitely one of those classics the whole family can enjoy! What can I say, it will be one of my all time favorite animated movies.
