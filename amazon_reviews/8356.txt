Love this vacuum!!!!  We have the Dyson DC41 animal, also purchased from Amazon and we were so impressed with the animal that when the cordless came up we thought it would be great for quick pick ups and cleaning carpets in the basement and it has been exactly that. I have no negative comments on this vacuum and even reconditioned it works like a brand new vacuum. Being cordless is really what sold us, small but effective.
