Waste of MONEY
I purchased this product due to the large collection of VHS tapes we have, figuring I could convert them all to CD. And a huge collection of LP's, well I tried a short movie first and it burned about ten minutes on DVD, quality was crappy. Second try was the advanced mode, again ten minutes of recording on DVD and the sound didn't match the vid. And quality was crappy again. I tried the LP to CD next, worked ok exept when you play it back in a cd player. You cant skip songs/tracks, another failure! Pure waste of money!
