Good computer-would recommend to a friend
The computer is good, really sharp,clear picture.  I was a little disappointed with the keyboard, it seemed to me that it was not quite as responsive as it should be.  I type well and I keep having to go back and correct spelling because sometimes it wasn't fast enough or sensitive enough to get the spelling correct with a very light touch.  I found that when I retyped I had to hit the keys harder than I thought necessary.
