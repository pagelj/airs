Workt great
Bought this to replace a locally purchased power supply that did not work with my wife's iPhone even though the package stated it was compatible. Plugged it in the car plug, plugged in the phone. It worked as expected, connected my iPad with no problem, connected her Bluetooth headset in the other usb port worked like a champ. The dual connections reduce the clutter of multiple device connection in her car. Build quality seems good, not flimsy like some adapters I have seen.
