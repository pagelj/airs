Nice tablet
This tablet was a gift for my wife, I am now a cyber widower.  She loves it and uses it daily for surfing, facebook and solitaire. The unit accepts a SAN disc so there is little chance that space becomes an issue. It stays charged for a day or two depending on use.  If you are in the market for a tablet you would do well to consider this.
