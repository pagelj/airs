we loved these but to0 small for kindergarten
Our 5  year old picked this out and really wanted it for Kindergarten, after it arrived we found out we had to be able to fit a legal sized envelope in it for school, there was no way it was even close to fitting. Unfortunately you cannot even fit a regular sized folder in it.  We love Amazons return policy and we were able to order this one instead Volcom Boys 8-20 Three Quarter Youth Backpack. The volcom one was still smaller than most so it did not look huge on him but big enough for his Kindergarten needs. ProsReally CuteSon loved itConsToo small for Kindergarten needs
