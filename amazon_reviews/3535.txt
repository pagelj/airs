Don't Get This Phone!
Not an ideal phone for anyone. Random restarts. Randomly refuses to make calls. Slow performance doing anything. While I understand this is an old phone, it doesn't have ICS support. Physical buttons are another negative, and my Home button no longer works. Doing any sort of unofficial upgrade via a recovery like ClockWorkMod is a complete pain, and official upgrades are broken on my device. The back plate for the battery WILL wear down and start easily falling off. Mine also had the black rubber material wear off and only the gray/white metal underneath remain. The positive? A large screen (at the time it was made) that isn't taken advantage of in Gingerbread. The camera is pretty good (although there's no front-facing camera). Two stars, because it at least functions in some basic capacity.
