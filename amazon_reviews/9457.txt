VERY DISAPPOINTED in Coby and AmazonLLC
I researched portable dvd players for hours before deciding to purchase this item through AmazonLLC[[ASIN:B0036QLHKC Coby TFDVD7052 7-Inch Portable Tablet DVD/CD/MP3 Player (Black)]. I did not want a dual dvd player, so I decided for the way it attached and the slender design this would a good purchase. When I received it, I was a little concerned about the way it looked, but wanted to let my granddaughter see it and make her choice(I purchased for Christmas).  She thought it was fine and liked the look and the way it attached to the headrest.  She tried using it and first it responded "no disc" then skipped through entire movies each time she used it.  I contacted both places to return, Coby gave me the run around by telling me that they would have to return my call but never did and since I was persistant and called again they finally told me to try cleaning first, because it could be dirty, (she had new movies to view).  We have to return it by paying shipping charges and send a money order for $10.00 for return shipping then they will send another one that frankly I am concerned will be the same.  She is a very disappointed 9 year old and will have to go back to using the old style that she has used for five years and still works fine but she just wanted a new updated style.
