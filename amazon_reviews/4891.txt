Perfect! No need for more expensive mounts!
I bought this to mount my 52" Mitsubishi flat panel to the wall. It took about a half hour to get the job done, and it looks AWESOME! Comes with all the screws and bolts you need, along with a bubble level that is very handy. I am so glad I didn't spend more, as this works just as well as the more expensive alternatives and LOOKS GREAT!
