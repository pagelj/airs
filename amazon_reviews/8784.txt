First use
I'm writing this review after only one use. Must come back and update it after using it for awhile. I fell in love with the features of this product. I wish there were more explicit instructions in the manual. The manual is fairly good but I am left with some questions after the first use this morning. I made breakfast sandwiches for my husband and I. They turned out fine just a little runny for my taste. Wast sure how much water to add for two eggs being poached at once. The manual didn't make any distinction. Anyhow, I'm sure that is user error and I'm pretty satisfied so far.
