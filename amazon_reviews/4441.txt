Item delivered in open box and broken seal.
I ordered this Samsung Galaxy S III GT-19300 Unlocked Brand new as the ad stated on the website urgently so I can use it when traveling Overseas. unfortunately, instead I received the item in an open box broken seal which assumed to be used. The item has some minor problems such intermittent flickering and I have to tap hard on the screen to execute programs which I can live with since I have to leave out of country and don't have time to send it back and get another one. The problem was reported immediately after I received unit, but the seller never replied back. The shipping was good and delivered on time.
