Easy to apply but NOT anti-glare!
I purchased these screen protectors based on the good reviews here on Amazon. They were easy to apply as stated, but they are definitely NOT anti-glare as some reviewers stated. There is a "sparkly" finish in the plastic that makes it almost impossible to see the screen when there is any kind of bright light, but especially in the sun.  If you are after anti-glare screen protectors that allow you to use your phone outdoors, this is not the product you want.
