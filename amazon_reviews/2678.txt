Misleading info
There is so much info on the 3 disc collectors edition on the barebone theatric 3d page that it makes the consumer think they are getting the fullest edition when this is not the case. I know there are many reviews on here stating to avoid this copy because it is a barebone verion in 3d but I didn't believe them because there is also so many reviews on here stating this is in fact the collectors 3 disk set in 3d not to mention the sellers many notes on the collectors edition contained therein the page to buy the normal theatrical 3d version. Oh well, I own avatar 3d the theatrical version and dont feel ripped off just misled. I'm sure the 3 disk set will be marked down anyhow once another cameron film is released.
