I recently purchased the Hoover Steam Carpet Cleaner and am very pleased with my purchase. It is light and easy to maneuver, the attachments are also easy to use and work very well. My carpeting looks as good as if I had it professionally done, I was delighted at its performance on every level. I wash the chord was a bit longer but other than that it was well worth the money and I highly recommend it!!  Peggy
