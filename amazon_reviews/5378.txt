I LOVE these
These are so perfect! I love them in my car for my two kids. They were so easy to setup. Once out of the box it took 5 minutes to install both items. I know that the AV cable is short but I never move them so it causes no issues. There is also no clarity issues using the AV jack to connect the two units. I only have two suggestions - I wish that they had a battery so I could bring them inside restaurants or places where I would like to be able to keep my children entertained. I also wish that they came with remote controls (would make it much easier to control my two year old sons player when I am driving) but I have managed to figure out with out them. I now find it quite easy to reach back to the passenger side of my vehicle (where my sons car seat is) and hit the play button when a movie is over. I also am happy that the movies tend to hold their place when you turn off the car. So when you get back into the car the movie resumes where it left off. Which is a huge bonus because I know when we are running errands all day my children would get sick of seeing the same 10 minutes of the movie over and over. This also saves us from having to change the movie every day lol because they can actually watch an entire movie all the way through with out having to continually repeat the same parts. With that said this is one purchase I would make over and over again.  I purchased this item when it was on sale at my local Walmart (I was planning on purchasing from Amazon but it was on sale at nearly the same cost so I went ahead and purchased it while I was there. I am so glad I did. One of the best purchases I have made. I am now looking at replacing the drop down DVD player in my other vehicle because I like these so much better.
