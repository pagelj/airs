Excellent workmanship -- a professional knife sharpener
This knife sharpener works really well with my 8-inch kitchen knife that I use for cutting meat, but it's difficult to sharpen my shorter paring knife. The slots don't provide enough room to fully sharpen a short blade. My paring knife's blade is about 4 inches long, but only 3 inches get sharpened.
