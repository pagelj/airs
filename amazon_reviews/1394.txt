I live in small apartment with my family having small active son, who often throws lots of stuff demanding thorough carpet cleaning. After a lot of research on the internet and with small budget I decided to buy Hoover UH700120. I assembled very quickly, and then it put it on work, and as most reviewer has already described, I could not believe how good the suction power this vacuum has. My carpet looked pretty new after vacuum. So it served the purpose, overall:PROS:**** Very good suction and easy to operate,**** Good cord length, which automatically rewindsCONS:- This uses material known to cause cancer, birth defects, as indicated by proposition 65; had I known this, I would not have bought this.- on/off switch and hose connectivity flimsy; I would update in future if it breaks and need to contact hoover to replace.- Crevice tool is not of good length to cover everything under sofas, beds.- While using crevice tool base floor brush keeps rotating which may damage your carpet, I tilt a bit to avoid floor contact. This is my first buy  and I am writing this review after first use. I will update how it performs in future.
