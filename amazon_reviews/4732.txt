One solution to the bubble problem with Kindle screen protectors
Despite my dislike of fitting the bubbly screen protectors on Kindles, I got good at it. Still, this Moshi screen is easier. Forget about the sticky kind. Some people think screen protectors take away from the vibrancy of the screen. I agree. It mostly depends on lighting. I think non-stick will be the new standard for screen protectors, only because they're easier to install.
