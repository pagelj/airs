Did not work
Recieved unit.  Set it up and could not get VHS recorder to work without video interference.  Called magnavox.  Told to send copy of receipt.  After one week had to call Magnavox again.  Sent unit back to magnavox.  It's been three weeks since I initially received the unit and still do not have a replacement.  The Magnavox people were very polite but three weeks!!
