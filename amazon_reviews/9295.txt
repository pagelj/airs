After my Dyson DC17 broke it's clutch for the 3rd time over 3 years ($50 replacement part + an hour of time if you have the right size torx screwdriver), I looked for an alternative and settled on this one.  Have it for about a month and so far so good. Pros:- price- even though plastic like Dyson, feels equally substantial- has accessories for pet, etc. (I have no pets, so haven't really used it)- easy to see, and adjust, beater brush bar (on the Dyson sometimes I was unsure if it was working)- suctionCons:- lots of nooks and crannies for the dust bin - I typically disassemble it to clean it out; the need to wash your hands afterwards is but a minor inconvenience. For the price and the performance I would recommend it.
