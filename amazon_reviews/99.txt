Great product!
I can't say enough about this product especially for the price. I Had my 42inch plasma up on the wall I. About 30 minutes. Straight forward instructions and the built in level made it a breeze to install. This is by no means a cheap inferior product to what you find in the big box retailers. It is just simply cheaper!  I was skeptical at first but after receiving and installing and now after about 2 months no issues what so ever.
