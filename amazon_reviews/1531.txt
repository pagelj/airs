Still a help after all these years!
I have a MacBook Pro running OSX 10.6.8. Snow Leopard is able to burn CD and DVD data disks and create music and video disks as well. Still, I find it is often easier to use Toast. Why? Well, the Mac OS often gives you a "full auto" way to make disks. If you are copying files from your hard drive for use by another Mac it's fine. If you are wanting to ship off your disk to a legacy mac or a PC of any flavor, you can still do this in the Mac Finder, but it can be a mistake prone effort since it assumes a lot and doesn't ask a bunch of questions regarding destination. Enter Toast 11. I've used the predecessors for years. It allows you to make sure you choose all the settings needed for off platform compatibility. This latest version runs fast and works well with no crashes or other issues on my system. Now for the reason I didn't give it five stars. The literature and the box imply that Toast 11 has native support for Blu Ray and other HD formats. It does not unless you buy the added plug in software and/or key. Bummer! I wouldn't dock it a star, but the way this is stated, that you must buy a "full" version to get this, is not all that clear. It's just clear enough to avoid a lawsuit, but not enough for me. It is "BluRay ready" or something like that. In any case, be careful what version you buy because they aren't all the same.
