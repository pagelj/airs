YAY Very nice Fun time
Setup including WiFi Internet, firmware update, configuration of Hulu-Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Pandora took about 20 minutes.  After that it was pure fun!  The interface is similar to the PS3.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well Youtube works.  I'm using it in my bedroom, and it has far exceeded my expectations.  Yes there are less expensive units that are similar in function, but this is so polished and fun to use it is worth paying a little more.  To me this is a better option than a Roku or similar.  I would certainly buy it again.
