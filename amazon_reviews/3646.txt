Glad there is more to come
This book leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Yes, Jesse has control issues but as the book says he has never been in love with anyone so this is his way of dealing with "being in so deep." If either Jesse or Ava could have opened up and discussed their blossoming feelings there would not have been so much insecurity on both of their parts. Hence the need for 2 more books. Despite some negative reviews, I enjoyed the book and look forward to the puzzles pieces fitting together in the next two books.
