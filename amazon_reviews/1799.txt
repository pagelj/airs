I LOVE THIS BLU-RAY PLAYER
This Blu-ray player is AWESOME!!!!  I don't have a 3D TV, so I can't take advantage of the 3D feature, but I'm sure that would make it even better.  I am able to stream movies or television shows (any video I want) from my computer as long as my computer and the player are connected to my home network (wired or WiFi).  All I have to do is just share them and the player will automatically find them and them are available. The player will also 'up convert' dvd's to 1080p so that it looks like you are watching a blu-ray disk, you just don't have the features that most blu-ray disks have. By the way, if I haven't mentioned before, I love this blu-ray player!!!
