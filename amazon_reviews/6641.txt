This knife is good for what it is... a cheap knife. It's light so it's easy to carry. I was taught how to use a magnesium firestarter with this and was told if I could do it using this, I could do it using any of them. The sheath can be improved by cutting a piece of milk carton and folding in the bottom... you won't poke through the end that way. But... it is seven dollars... don't expect a perfect, do-everything masterpiece. It's a good deal.
