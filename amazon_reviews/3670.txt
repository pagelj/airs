What an excellent buy
The device is made very well. It reads and writes surprisingly quick especially when connected to usb 3. The price I got it for when it was on sale made it a great buy even though its regular price isn't bad. Extremely handy to carry 2tb of space around with you. The fact its usb powered just seals the deal. A terrific purchase.
