Works as touted
Because of my carelessness, the first screen film I applied didn't fit correctly.  The second attempt yielded a fine result due to more care on my part.  I like the protector.  One reason is that it is a "dry" installation film -no wet stuff, long drying time, etc.  I bought the clear model.  I am pleased with result and I now have protection on the front of my iPhone 5. Buy this protector.  The company stands behind their products -and the packaging and directions are first class.
