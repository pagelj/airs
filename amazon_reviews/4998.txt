super sleek
was surprised to hold the unit after opening the box due to its size. i know its a point & shoot but i never reckoned that it was gonna be this small for a waterproof shockproof unit. i have owned different brands with the same characteristics but this is by far the best in terms of looks. elegant and distinctly suave. have yet to test it underwater and will update my review soon
