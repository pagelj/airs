I am sort of a middle-of-the-road "coffee snob" - I like fresh roasted beans, but I don't grind every day (fresh coffee ground 3 days ago is still better than the stuff on the grocery shelf).  I appreciate good coffee but don't go so far as to measure water temperature, etc. I am the only coffee drinker in the house, so my primary coffeepot was a 6-cup HB Brewstation.  However, some mornings I can only manage one cup of coffee before I'm out the door, and a 6-cup pot doesn't do 1-cup very well.  I often found myself wasting coffee -- I buy beans fresh-roasted from Boca Java, so wasting it wasn't making me very happy. Plus... I had FOUR coffeemakers in my house.  I have a Tassimo (which I only use for mochas/lattes/tea, because every other coffee I've tried is brown water), a Senseo (that I got for free, but hate), the 6-cup Brewstation and a 12-cup Mr Coffee for when we have company.  Insanity!! My husband gave me this for Christmas.  I was a little skeptical but it's been a GREAT purchase.  Most mornings I use the single side, so I make exactly the amount I want.  On weekends when things are calmer, I'll often use the carafe side so I can make more.  The coffee is great and the whole thing is pretty easy to clean.  The bold setting takes forever and I noticed a bitter taste to my coffee, so I've set it to normal and kept it there. The only con -- I really despise the gold filter on the single-serve side.  Even when I grind my beans on the coarse setting I get gunk in the bottom of my cup.  I tried cutting a paper filter down to size and that did the trick, but I'm not going to do that every morning!  So, I'm on a hunt for a paper filter small enough to fit.  I figure since it will take Senseo pods, there should be paper filters for Senseo out there somewhere that don't require a $50 machine... My other pots (except the Tassimo) are headed for the trash heap.  I am really happy with this product.
