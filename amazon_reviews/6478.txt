Dinc will go down in history as one of the best 3g androids
PROS: At the time of release, it was the best of the best. Fast CPU, clear AMOLED screen, and HTCs superior hardware configuration. The 8MP camera is STILL a great spec for a smartphone camera, and it has a great picture and video capture ability. CONS: Like all technology, it needed some upgrades notably a dual core CPU and a bigger screen. Also, replaced the Froyo OS!!! The droid incredible 'S', 2, and 4g are basic incremental updates to this phone and they are still viable smartphones in late 2012. I purchased a HTC droid incredible thru Verizon wireless's CPO program in October 2010, after it had been release spring 2010. I had a few clear intentions: I wanted a certified phone due to the cost and the fact I knew these phones were as good as new. I believe the price w/ 2 year contract was $99 for two phones. My original phone was great, and I had it "rooted and ROM'd" runningSkyraider 3.5 which at the time was one of the best replacement Android 2.2 roms. I subsequently drowned that phone, andit was replaced with another CPO phone. I again gained root privileges and customized the phone to my needs. Except by this time, Verizon had released the Android 2.3 OTA update. I found a suitable de-bloated version of this OTA and installed it. This phone along with an inexpensive 1900Mah battery that I purchased from a USA seller on 'that auction site' had a long life. However, with the dawn of 4G LTE speed, the larger 4. xx size screens, and the desire for a faster CPU led me to upgrade. But HTC hit a homerun with this phone, probably never to be repeated. It's highly recommended as a 3G smartphone esp if you ROM it! Some of my favorite DINC roms: MIUI, Skyraider 4. x, Cyanogenmod version+, and the ones based on stock gingerbread.
