Great Screen Protector - Excellent Value
My first screen protector and so far it's been very solid. Very easy to apply and it fits well with my case without any bunching or bubbling on the edges, which is a complaint I've read about with other protectors. It still does pick up fingerprints occasionally and it does distort the clarity of the screen ever so slightly, but for the price, it seems to be a great deal so far. Highly recommended.
