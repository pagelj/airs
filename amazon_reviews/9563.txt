Cord does not Sync with the computer
This cord is just OK. But does not do what I need it to do. It does charge my iPod 4th generation 8G only if I use the wall outlet adapter.  It does not sync to my computer to charge or down from my iTunes account. I bought 2 cords one for me, one for my grandson. Nether of the cords work. I love the length of the cord. just wist it would sync to my computer. The description said it was for charging and syncing it does not do that. All thumbs down on this one.
