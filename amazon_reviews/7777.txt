adapter keyboard cable a hassle.
The case was a recommended purchase with Vision Land 7in Tablet.. The Keyboard's USB cable needs an adapter cable to fit tablet. The tablet has no space for this extra cable. Closing the case with extra cable can scratch screen. Stylus does not work. The price was cheap enough and keyboard works.
