Works well
Hi, I purchased 2 of these for my daughters. They have iPods with a separate speaker in each of their rooms. This plug made it easier plug them in and not use both outlet spots. It works as described, I have been using the plug for about 1 month now and there have been no issues. I recommend this product to others.
