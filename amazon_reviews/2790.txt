20,000 leagues under the boring
The good author believes the gentle reader is fascinated by detailed descriptions of underwater flora, fauna, and geology when, in reality, gentle reader is wondering when something is going to happen.  Many is the retired gent who has come to me with his list of a kabillion classics he is supposed to read before he dies and I suggest he also check out maybe a cowboy and a mystery, but he does not and he never checks out anything again.  Well, a "classic" is merely a book that is still in print, possibly because the publisher does not have to pay royalties on public domain titles.  Now, this book is still in  print; so, by golly, it indeed qualifies as a classic.  And, it is just the thing to give to a reluctant reader to prevent him from ever checking out anything again.  It is definitely not a fast read by modern standards.  Not that TLUTS is not a great read, but it is hard work for an average reader and should not be required of the inexperienced reader.  Thus the book deserves, perhaps, a 5 star for the experienced classic reader but only a 1 star for the novice.
