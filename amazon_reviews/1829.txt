Great movie... Lousy DVD Set
First off, why oh why did we have to have the Theatrical Version in this set? I bought that DVD six months ago. We don't need a repeat here! The Special Edition isn't really even necessary, either, since all of those scenes and more are actually in the Extended Cut. I guess that one's for people who only want to see a few of the added scenes, but not all. Maybe they're running short on time that day or something. Frankly, if I'm gonna watch extra scenes, just show all of them to me. So, they put the first half of three different versions of the movie on disc 1 and the second half of these versions on disc 2. I hate that!! I thought I was done with changing discs mid-movie when Dances with Wolves and The Green Mile did that years ago. I know they can put a 3-hour movie on one disc. I see miniseries and TV show discs all the time with at least three hours on them! The packaging is 50/50. The outer layers are great. I love the book style with the slipcovers over them. I thought it would unfold like the Fox TV series of Buffy or Angel. No. It opens like a book and each disc has a carboard sleeve that slides out of the end of each page. Rough cardboard sleeves that the disc slides around in during shipping and handling. YOUR DISCS WILL BE SCUFFED OR SCRATCHED WHEN YOU OPEN IT. So, my idea would have been: put all of the Special Edition on Disc 1 (for those who wanted to see that version), put all of the Extended Cut on Disc 2 (my favorite) and leave Disc 3 with the featurettes and deleted scenes as it is. Think a little, people! Don't just cram all the crap you can find on a "Collector's Edition" set and throw it in there all willy-nilly. And switch to a more orthodox way of disc storage so as not to damage them before we ever get them, please? This set could have been as wonderful as I think the movie is. 5 for the movie. 3 for the DVDs.
