Amazing value for your money
I ordered this to make my 1-2 daily smoothies with and I've used it for a week now and it's been great! I've used it with frozen fruit and with ice and it's had no problem blending it all smooth! It's not nearly as loud as I thought it would be either, my big blender is way louder. It's an amazing value for your money!
