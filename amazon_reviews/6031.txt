Worst phone I've owned
Bought this phone three months ago, been nothing but a headache... Randomly vibrates until rebooted. Doesn't always let you type when texting, have to go in and out of messaging several times to get it to work, and then have to go into another app to get it typing again. Does almost the same thing with calling.  Has to be my worst experience with a phone in 17 years.  Soooo glad to getting rid of it!!!
