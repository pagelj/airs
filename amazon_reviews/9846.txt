Defective card
I received this item the day before I left for Disney to use with my new video camera. When I inserted the card at Disney, I was able to record for approximately 5 minutes before an error message was displayed. According to the camera, the card was "full". I was never able to get anything else to record on this card. I wan't sure at the time if the card was defective or the camera. On return to home, I purchased a new SDHC card at Sam's, and low and behold, the camera works fine. I have since been unable to download the meager video I was able to record from this card. To say I was disappointed in this item is an understatement. There I was in Disney and I couldn't video tape, and since I wasn't sure if the card was the problem, I didn't bother trying to track down a new SDHC card outside of the park. Don't order this!
