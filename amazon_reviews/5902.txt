I have never owned a stick vac before so this is my first experience and have nothing to compare it to. With that said, it has met my expectations. I purchased it specifically to vacuum the never ending "stuff" on my wood floors. With 4 boys in the house I vacuum every day  - no fail! I was tired of dragging out my fav vacuum of 5 years to do a quick job and I wanted something better then the ordinary broom. [as a side not - I purchased an Aerus Electrolux canister (not the same as Electrolux) for about $1200 5 years ago. I figured if it could last 5 years then I'd be ahead even for all of the crappy vacuums I'd ultimately buy through the years and toss out. This bar none has been an amazing vacuum]. Anyway, I like the ease of the Linx and the power is just fine. At first I was trying to vacuum too quickly because I was afraid of the short life of the battery so I couldn't be the obsessive vacuumer as I know we all are that are posting our comments here. Luckily the battery hasn't been an issue because my expectations are simply to keep my wood floor clean and maybe touch up some on the adjoining carpets. I would like one for my upstairs but for the price I just can't justify it. It looks like the price is going down based on Amazon's price listed today. I give it 4 stars because it does what it should. I had one hiccup with it and that was the button to release dirt - another writer complained of this too. Mine just doesn't function exactly right. If it keeps up I will ask for a replacement. I think the price is high but if it lasts 5 years like my fav vacuum then it will be well worth the money!
