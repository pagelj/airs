Not what i expected
I bought this phone  as a gift for my teenage son. however upon receiving the phone it appears to be faulty.  Instead of touch screen it seems to be "press screen"  because the screen has to be pressed really hard in order to use it.  The phone is constantly freezing.  Also, even though i selected NEW ITEM this item does not appear to be a new phone because my son had to delete some items from the  phone.  I am disappointed and returning this product.
