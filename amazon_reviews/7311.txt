Unique Post Apocalyptic Novel
To be honest, I noticed this series after the price was discounted. The reviews looked good and I had nothing to loose. The first book was a little hard to get into but after a few chapters I was hooked and went through all 5 books in relative short order.  I was a little disappointed in the ending which resulted in a lost star. However, I see there are other follow on books. So my journey isn't over yet. I recommend these books to anyone into post apocalyptic books. The characters and circumstances were interesting and compelling.
