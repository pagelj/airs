Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven 1800 Watt Convection Toaster Oven
I chose this oven for a gift for my 90 year old mother. She wanted a small oven that would toast and bake. The oven she was currently using wasn't big enough for a casserole dish and it made terrible toast. Consumers rated this product A+ so we purchased it. My mother loves it and uses it daily. It delivered on all of the promised features.
