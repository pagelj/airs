Car Mount
This is a nice car mount. Easily fits all types of phones and sticks like a glove to that windshield. Only downfall is when you are driving, the unit shakes but you can still view the phone and GPS routing with no problem. I think this is worth the price. I would suggest anyone that wants a cheap car mount that will work, to order this unit.
