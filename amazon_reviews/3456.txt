Works good, priced right
HDMI cables are one of the biggest scams out there, with stores charging FAR more than they're worth and claiming they provide better picture quality. The truth is that because of the way they're designed, they either provide a PERFECT picture or they fail miserably. There is no "better picture".  Inexpensive cables like this are every bit as good as high-dollar cables, and it's good to see that SOME manufacturers and distributors are honest enough to provide good-quality cables at a reasonable price. Thank you!
