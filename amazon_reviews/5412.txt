Great Value
Great product! This is a great deal for anyone who already or who is looking to subscribe to online streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime. It also, has built in apps that Apple TV does not have such as HBO GO and is about $30 cheaper. I highly recommend Roku to anyone looking to find a cheaper alternative to either a cable box or Apple TV.
