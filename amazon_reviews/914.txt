HD-DVD Died a few days ago when Warner Brothers Dropped Support
Buying this device right now would be foolish.  The news that Warner Brothers is dropping support for HD-DVD and going BluRay exclusive is the death of HD-DVD.  You will only be getting about 1/3rd of all movies released on the HD-DVD format.  Being that 2/3rds of the studios have now firmly backed BluRay, there is VERY little hope that HD-DVD survives the rest of the year, much less forever. If you really want an HD DVD player, do yourself a big favor and wait about five months.  You should be able to pick up this useless addon then for about $25. Heck, the one studio the HD DVD has exclusive, Paramount, has their biggest producer, Stephen Spielberg, saying his movies must come out on BluRay.  You have Michael Bay, the Transformers producer, actively railing against HD DVD and promoting BluRay.  He was very vocal and ticked off that Transformers wasn't coming to BluRay.  Well, given this Warner announcement, it should be coming to BluRay pretty soon now.
