Disappointing but not terrible
I consider little stories like this literary junk food, except this one didn't even fulfill that guilty pleasure. I wasn't sure why at least one scene was even included, as it really did  nothing to further the story. If it was supposed to make me see the male lead as vulnerable, it failed. It just made him seem... I don't even know what. SPOILER####To see a grown man reduced to whimpering and being an emotional basket case by the sight of a kitten just stretched my imagination way too far! I didn't see him as vulnerable. I just thought the whole scene was unnecessary and ridiculous. Also, what kind of man entrusts a child to a woman because he "trusts her on sight"? Not any parent I know.####I won't be purchasing any more of this series, simply because even at 99 cents I didn't feel I got my money's worth. I've read fan fiction (FREE!) that was FAR better than this.
