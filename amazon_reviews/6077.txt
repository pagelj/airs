I like it!
I have only had my Kindle Fire for about two months, so I can't say I speak from experience just yet.  But, I am enjoying it very much so far.  I actually am using it as I would a laptop, in my kitchen.  I can transfer files to it -- photos, music, recipes, documents, etc., and can access the internet there instead of traipsing upstairs to use my PC.  I have been using my phone for some of these things, but the 8.9" screen makes a big difference when I'm trying to get the full view of something.  It is a little bit of a bummer to have to purchase a data plan to use the internet (I don't have wifi access at my house), and I also have a separate data plan for my PC upstairs, so I'll see how that plays out over time.
