Inexpensive, color coded and functional High speed HDMI cables!!
I highly recommend these high-speed HDMI cables from amazon for following reasons:-Cheap (price wise but not quality wise). Don't spend more than 5-10 $ per cable for HDMI cables. If you google a little you will know that these are perfectly fine as opposed to any $20 or higher priced HDMI cables-These have color coded bands around them. This is very handy when you are trying to match correct equipment with correct HDMI slot.-These are high-speed, support ARC, 3D and ethernet. I can confirm that ARC & 3D both work fine. Ethernet I was not able to test because there is not a single device on market that uses HDMI over ethernet (HEC) functionality yet as of the time of writing this review-They are indeed good build quality: Not too flimsy that they feel fragile and not too hard that they cannot be flexed when you need to flex them trying to pull through harder corners, holes. If you are looking for inexpensive high speed HDMI cables that support ARC, 3D, ethernet. These are the ones. Just buy them!!~Cybersimba
