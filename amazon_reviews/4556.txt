Excellent for the price
Great value for the price. This was a hassle free purchase and connected with no problems. I was very suprised that it immediately worked as soon as I put the batteries in and turned on the rear VES in my Dodge Grand Caravan 2012. I ordered two in error but I am extremely happy I did.
