Fun Toy
My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday.  It quickly became one of her favorite toys.  She tends to put any toy up to her ear like she is talking on the telephone, and I love that this actually gives her something to listen to when she does that.  The fact that it is quiet encourages her to hold it close to her ear so she can hear it better - I think this is intentional, although it is a complaint of many reviewers.  Each button offers different recordings, such as a weather forecast, voicemail, counting, ABC's, and the songs are very pleasant.  It is bulky, but my little girl has no problem holding it to her ear with one hand.
