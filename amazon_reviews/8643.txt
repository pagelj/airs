I received a very good Motorola Cell phone as promised
I was tired of my Nokia E62 and its multifunctions and relatively high weight. I decided to buy a simple, not do-all cellular phone. I went back in time and I ordered a new Motorola V3 and was pleased to receive a brand new phone with a new battery. Delivery on time as promised.
