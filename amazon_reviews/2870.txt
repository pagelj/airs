Thanks to Amazon for their great customer service. However, they shipped me three, yes, three units since the first one arrived with dents in the front of the large can. Amazon quickly sent me out a replacement which I received the next day. Again it had dents on the side. A third unit was shipped out and this time it had a smaller dent, which would have been acceptable but it was missing the smaller trash can. Without the dents, I would give this product 5 stars. But since there were no signs of mishandling from the carrier on the box, I assume the dents from all three units came from the manufacturer, I'm giving it 3 stars. I couldn't resist but to install the batteries and see how it operated. The product seems to work well, the lid opens and shuts with a soft "whirr" of the motor but otherwise quietly and performed as described. Also note: The large trash can takes "C" batteries, while the smaller one takes "D".
