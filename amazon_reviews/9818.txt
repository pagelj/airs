Nice Player
I've only had this player for about two weeks now. It's played everything great. Purchased it for under eighty dollars and also with a two year replacment warranty for seven dollars. If someone wants to do more than play discs with a player then maybe they need to spend more than eighty dollars for it. I'm very satisfied with this player.
