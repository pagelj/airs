I really really hate this trash can. The LED sensor stopped working in less than a week. I had to wave my hand in front of it for at least 10 seconds before it would register and open. The only good thing about this trash can is that it holds odors in better than any trash can I have ever owned. Unfortunately, I had to return this to Amazon and will stick to a non-motorized one from now on.
