useless part
First of all the replacement screen did not fit the phone - mounting tabs in the wrong place.  After carefully modifying to fit, screen didn't work anyway - faint blue color, nothing else.  At least the tool kit was slightly useful - although the philips head was too large for the screws.  Overall useless and and a waste of money.
