Well, we haven't poked our eyes out.
These are VERY light throwing knives that offer very little blade weight for proper throwing.  Although my 17 year old has had hours of fun throwing them at a board in which he has taped photographs of his  errrr  least favorite political figureheads.  Not to mention the occasional boy band symbols.. All in all, they are fun to play with..  Not good for much else..  no distance.  close range only.
