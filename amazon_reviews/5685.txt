I was looking to buy this vacuum when, talking to a carpet store owner and installer, I was told that there are some of the more expensive carpets that the guarantee is actually void if you have used a Dyson on them.  Yes, great suction, but too much can actually pull up the carpet fibers.  Be careful if you have new carpeting.
