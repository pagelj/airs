great phones
Ordered two LG800G phones that arrived quickly. They are great phones. Both phones had to be replaced due to a problem not connecting to the web. Not sure what the problem was? The triple minutes and 1200 bonus minutes was an asset. One big problem is there is no decent manual on the phone. Have to go on line to user forums, one by Tracfone, to get answers on "how to". A comprehensive manual would certainly alleviate aggravation. All in all it is a great phone
