Invasion Earth -The world has begun
This was shown in Australia a few years ago on late night T. V. Times and days were always changed and never saw the ending. What i saw was fantastic and gets you hooked on this show. I love SciFi and this was very different to watch. Its a shame there is no sequal and longer series. I was waiting for this to come on on dvd(Not released in Australia at all)and got a copy of Amazon. Now i have a copy I can watch again and again. It could have had more special features but i am happy now its on dvd(Finally)I recomend this show -  100%Paul Haigh (Melbourne, Australia)
