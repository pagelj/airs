I have had a bagless Shark for a few years now and every time I use it want to throw it out the window. It lasts about 10 minutes before it goes out and I have to wait another 15 to let it restart itself. It was my first non-bagged cleaner. It didn't matter how many times I cleaned the filters it always stopped. Anyway, that being said I was very hesitant to buy a new canister type cleaner. I have mostly hard wood & tile in my new house, and have one big area rug in the living room. The Shark would just throw things around the hardwood and stop working on the rug. This Hoover Upright Stick is the perfect solution! It works GREAT! The first time I used it I was amazed. I had forgotten how dark my color was on my rug. Hoover has always been an reliable brand and I will never stray again. Hopefully, this will be my last cleaner for a while. It is well worth the money I spent and more! My advice, don't hesitate to get it.
