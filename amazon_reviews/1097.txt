Finally plug free when I travel !
I travel frequently enough that I am always looking for a free plug at an airport, conference, or meeting. I have used smaller batteries before and while they were nice for emergencies they never lasted more than one charge for whatever device I was using. The iCruiser is by far the best battery pack I have used! It is definitely bigger than others I have used but it very easily fits in any travel bag I use. (it takes up  about the same space as an iPad charge with cable) The capacity  was so good I initially thought I was using it wrong, the indicator never seemed to move off of fully charged. In reality it just holds a lot of juice for you to be able to dole out to whatever USB charged device you have. I now charge it about every other week to keep it topped of but I can skip right past finding a wall plug and just charge devices in my bag or on the flight. My latest test is plugging my wifi hotspot into it and being a mobile hotspot with all day power and no wall plug! very cool!
