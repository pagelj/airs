square trade warranty company
Purchased a laptop for my daughter from Best Buy and purchased a full 3 year warranty from square trade for $75. Best Buy wanted more than double this price for a warranty. After 1 1/2 years the computer wouldn't close down one day. Took it to a local shop for a free diagnostic and they said the mother board failed. I called square trade, gave them the info, faxed them the paperwork from the repair shop. Within 2 days I had an accepted claim and prepaid mailing label to send the laptop in. It arrived to them in 3 days and 2 days later my check for the full purchase price was approved. A check arrives within 7-10 days or a paypal deposit will be made within 48 hours. Best customer service I have ever had and it was all done by phone! Will be buying a new warranty from square trade as soon as we pick out a new laptop.
