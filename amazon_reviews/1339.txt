AWSOME!!!
As a HUGE fan of the game Halo, I could not put this book down until I had read it cover to cover... twice! It answered almost every question I had about Master Chief, the war, the covenent, etc. It is a well written and interesting book in it's own right but if you are even remotely a fan of the game then this book is a must have!!!
