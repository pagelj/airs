Fantastic DVD Player
I ordered this Sony DVPSR210P DVD Player for my sister. Her DVD player broke about 6 months ago and she has never got around to purchasing another one. This is a great and simple-to-use DVD player. It is very small and will easily fit in small places, it has a nice little remote that it comes with that allows you to perform all the functions the DVD player has without having to touch the console and it is very easy to setup. The DVD player is a very sleek black color, so it will match with most TV cabinets. Overall, I am very pleased with this Sony DVD player and I love the fact that it only cost $35. I have been having trouble finding any DVD players at local stores that cost less than $40. I would recommend this DVD player to anyone who is looking for a basic DVD player to watch their movies on.
