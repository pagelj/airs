Reliable!
No matter what you camera camcorder recommends, always use a class 10 SDHC card to avoid freezing, errors and possible file storage issue. I have always used transcend in all of my cameras and camcorders. When you are getting paid for the video and photo work, you learn real fast that you only want the best. They have never let me down.
