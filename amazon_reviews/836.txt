Great knives
I couldn't be happier with these knives.  I purchased them for my new job in a new restaurant and have been testing them out at home before I start.  They're holding their edges beautifully with a light steeling after each use.  They may not be the most expensive knives out there, but they're certainly the best I've ever used.
