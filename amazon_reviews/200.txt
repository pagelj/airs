All you need in one package!
This phone is amazing!  The 3G internet is so fast using the hotspot, that I cancelled my home DSL service, so now I will be able to take my laptop or iTouch with me anywhere and have internet, in addition to the unlimited internet on the phone ($29.99 service plan required). The keys are a little small, so if you have big fingers, this may not be the phone for you, but other than that the operation of the phone is very easy, and set up is a breeze! HP now owns Palm, so the webOS is awesome!
