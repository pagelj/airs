Well made & great size
The bag is perfect for all the things I need to carry back and forth to work.  Laptop, papers, pens, cell phone, etc.  It is a little less 'stiff' than I expected from the picture, but then it is canvas, so I should have expected it not to stand up on its own like the picture implies.  However, it doesn't take away from its function or great appearance!  I highly recommend this as a carry-all man bag.
