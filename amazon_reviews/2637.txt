Simply Brilliant!
I ordered this after finding many boxes of old VHS tapes in my attic.  My neighbor suggested a place for me to get them converted to DVD. The price was 12 tapes for $225! Way to much to spend.  I did a search on Amazon, after reading many reviews, I decided to try this Honestech product.  Boy am I glad I did.  Very simple product to set up and to use.  The finished product is awesome.  Thanks so much for offering such a great product at such a reasonable price.  Highly recommend!
