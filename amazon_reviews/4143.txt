Good backpack for the price
In this price range, I don't believe you can find a better back pack.  Nice padded back and shoulder straps, plenty of storage and/or expansion and fully loaded it feels like you can pack even more on to it.  I would have given it 5 but I am a little unsure as to how well the canvas material will hold up once I hit the great outdoors.  Hopefully the seams and straps will stay intact but other than that, I'm completely happy with it.
