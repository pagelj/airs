Good Product SLOW SHIPPING!
The products is good.  Wish the length of the cable was a little longer but it works sufficiently for what I wanted it to do of lighting up my work surface and keyboard while working in a darkened room.  The only complaint I have on the product is the shipping time.  It says it ships from Hong Kong.  Well it was on the slowest ship from Hong Kong as I ordered Nov 14th and received it December 26th.
