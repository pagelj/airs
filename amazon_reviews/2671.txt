Fits The Bill
Very compact yet capable no-contract phone.  Minimum usage cost is $25/3 months, i. e., if you don't use the minutes included for $25 dollars within 3 months you loose them and have to pay $25 (or more for additional minutes) for the next quarterly period.  GO SIM card is included with purchase (that wasn't stated in description and I wasted $6 on ordering another, which was useless since it can only be used for initial activation.)  Recommended for those who only need service for occasional use.  Used recently in New York City for voice and text and always got a connection.
