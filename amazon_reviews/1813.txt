Not so cool pad
Cheap in price, but like always, cheap is usually a cheap product. Well, the Cool Pad is no exception. The bottom of the fans are not protected and anything, including your fingers, are subject to damage. One of the blades to the center fan broke the same day I received it. It will definitely NOT work in your lap. Cooling is yet another issue. The three fans do NOT supply enough air to cool my computer. I beleive the lesson learned here, is to spend a little more to get what you really need.
