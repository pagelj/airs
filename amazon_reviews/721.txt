We had had for 10 years a Mr. Coffee thermal carafe programmable, when it started bleeding coffee out the bottom, the search began. I went with the Melitta because of pricepoint and also because it had wisely put the programming features up top. My Mr. Coffee's clock was illegible from a spill over that had ruined the liquid crystal. So it came and the carafe is a solid piece of brushed aluminum. There's no glass!!!  YAY!!!!! I forgot how intense a brew the cone shaped filters make so that took some adjusting but the brew is great. It's hot and flavorful without any bitterness at all. The clock light is very very bright and will work like a neon light in your kitchen. The only other down side is the view window for the water only allows you to make a 6 cup minimum (that's two traveller's cups) so making one cup requires you to use a measuring cup. As I rarely make more than 6 cups of coffee, that it makes only 10 is insignificant.
