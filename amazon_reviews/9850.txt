OK camera
I bought the PowerShot S100 in Dec 2011.  It is simple to use and I really liked the fact that I could put this in manual mode and really control the settings.  However not having a view finder makes it really hard to do anything creative and so if I were to do it again, I'd opt for a POS with a view finder.  Also, I've not had the camera for more than 9 months with limited use and it has never been dropped or misused and yet the zoom no longer works.  When I try to zoom, the camera shuts off and says there is an error in the lens.  Luckily it's still under warranty and so I hope the experience to get this repaired is a good one.
