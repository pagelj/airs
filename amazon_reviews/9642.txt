very nice
I recently bought this purse despite other reviews regarding the smell, yes there was a slight plasticky-neoprene smell, but I opened the zipper and left it hanging for a few days and honestly the smell is gone. The purse is nice and soft,perfect color though a little bigger than I expected, but it will hold all my things plus my kindle and probably whatever else I want to cram into it on an upcoming vacation. The one thing I didn't like was the handles, much too small and cheap. I took the bag to a shoe repair in town and he made me a couple of longer brown leather handles and now the bag is perfect. It did add to the overall cost of the bag, but it was pretty inexpensive to begin with and I like it that much.
