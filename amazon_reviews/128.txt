I buy these for all my cameras
I have so many of these Transcend cards in the 4 GB, 8 GB and 16 GB Class 10 configuration that I've lost count. No complaints with any of them, they are fast and reliable, and a great price. I have nothing to complain about. The reduced-plastic packaging is easy to open, too.
