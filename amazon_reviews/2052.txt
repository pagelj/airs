Absolutely Essential Product
I got one of these for Christmas.  This is an ESSENTIAL item for anyone who carries a computer with them.  I have the system restore files of BOTH laptops saved to this drive (which I've used more than once for a fresh install).  I still have plenty of room left over for all of my music, photos, movies, and even TV shows.  I travel a lot for work and use power points and videos to teach ESL classes.  This plugs easily into any computer and is as portable as a deck of cards. WD is a very reliable brand.  The speed is not as fast as my "plug in" style hard drives that I use for my media server at home, but they're far more portable. Now that there's a 2TB model on the market, I'm going to order one and put a system image of all three computers on there for backup/restore purposes.  I'm working on my Master's thesis so having a safe physical backup of my machines that I can lock in the fire safe is a must. Pros:  Simple, cheap, reliable, and unlike the cloud, doesn't require internet. Cons:  It doesn't dispense beer and $100 bills on demand. Seriously, I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't love this little drive.
