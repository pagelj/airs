I bought this because I have a lot of hard floors in my home and two dogs.  I needed to be able to suck up the hair and dust prior to mopping and I hated the corded vacs because I was contantly having to unplug and move to a new plug.  I was concerned this would not pick up as well as the corded version but it does very well.  I also purchased an additional battery since I have A LOT of hard floors and I was worried about battery life.  Obviously if you only run suction and not the brush you get better battery life, but if you have a lot to vacuum I'd suggest getting an extra battery.
