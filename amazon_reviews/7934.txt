completely blocks view of screen
It is almost impossible to see my phone screen through this screen protector. It glares intensely. It's very thick. It's solid silver instead of clear. When I put it on my phone, it was like viewing the screen through a white plastic bag.  And it has a sticky residue. EVERY claim the seller made about how it would work is FALSE. The seller should be ashamed of themselves.
