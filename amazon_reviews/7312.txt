Great Price & Value for $
This oven was exactly what I was looking for and more. It's quality built and I expect it to last for years.  Toasting is easy and done well - it even tells you how much time is left in the cycle.  I have also baked pizza in it and it was fine!  Saved having to heat up the oven on my range!
