MY NEW HOOVER W/PET HAIR ATTACHMENT IS THE BEST EVER.  I REPLACED THE OLDER VERSION BECAUSE IT WAS 4 YEARS OLD BUT STILL VACUUMED OK, BUT HAD GONE THRU 2 PET HAIR ATTACHMENTS AS THEY WOULD GET JAMMED TIGHT WITH MY PERSIAN CATS HAIR SHE LEFT ON THE FURNITURE.  THE NEW PET ATTACHMENT HAS RUBBER BLADES RATHER THAN BRISTLES AND WORKS MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY.  THE VACUUM CLEANS JUST AS WELL IF NOT BETTER AND THE BRISTLES IN THE MAIN VACUUM HAVE AN ON/OFF SWITCH FOR USE ON CARPET OR HARD FLOORS, A VERY NICE OPTION.  THE BAGLESS CLEANOUT IS A LITTLE MESSY, BUT REALLY NICE TO BE ABLE TO WASH EVERYTHING INCLUDING FILTERS WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY NEW.  THIS NEW HOOVER ALSO HAS THE RETRACTABLE POWER CORD WHICH I REALLY LIKE AND THE HANDLE FOLDS FOR SHORT STORAGE WHICH I DON'T USE. FOR THE PRICE OF $115 WITH NO SHIPPING CHARGES, IT WAS REALLY A GOOD BUY FROM AMAZON.
