Not a very good cable
I was really excited when I found these inexpensive cables on Amazon. Thinking that more expensive cables was merely a racket I jumped on board the inexpensive cable bandwagon. However, they are not great cables. When connected to my DVD player there was a screen flicker about every 15-30 seconds. Eventually my wife told me that it was bothering her. Suspecting that it was the cheap cable I swapped out the HDMI cable with a more expensive Phillips brands cable and there was no more video flicker. These cables are a waste of money and I'll be throwing mine away to purchase more expensive and higher quality cables.
