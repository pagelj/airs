Thermal pot keeps the coffee warm for hours and hours (as long as you close the lid properly). Looks great. Doesn't take up too much space. Love the clock and auto setting. Haven't experienced the filter issue others have mentioned, but I use a reusable filter and not paper. My only wish is that the top that you put on after the coffee is brewed be attached in some way to the pot--I just know that I'm going to lose it.
