Excellent choice!
After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about purchasing the red case because apparently it was an "ugly" red. I went with my gut feeling and bought it, it arrived just in time so that I can bring my Macbook to class without worrying that it wouldn't be protected. The case is exactly how it is pictured and described. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, yet wants a durable case. I was satisfied with how quickly it was shipped to me.
