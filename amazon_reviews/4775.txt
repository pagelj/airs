Know what you're buying.
This isn't a laptop, and if you buy it to replace one you are going to be disappointed. If you have researched the chrome OS and decided it works for your uses, then this is the chromebook to buy. I got it for my girlfriend since she is on call all the time for work and everything she does is through a browser.  This thing boots insanely fast, has great battery life, and has full access to googles online armory.  It's pure win for convenience.
