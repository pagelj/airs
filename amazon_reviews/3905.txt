Great for Hiking and even Shopping
I bought this backpack for travelling. It is very sturdy and able to hold many items and yet at the same time doesn't look bulky. Most importantly, you will not feel the bag is heavy even with many heavy things stuffed in the bag. I used it for hiking as well and the back cushion makes me feel very comfortable. I even used it for shopping as it is a nice design. Only downside is that it is not waterproof.
