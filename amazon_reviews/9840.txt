Best bang for you buck
If you have never had a sharp knife, a real chef's knife, because they were too expensive, this is the knife you need.  Its amazing quality for its price and is a sharp and balanced as some of the $100 knives I have used. I purchased one for myself after reading the Cook's Illustrated review, and even then I wasn't expecting much, but the quality of this knife knocked my socks off, the edge is surprisingly sharp, the balance is great, and the control is awesome.  I was so happy with this knife that I immediately got one for my father (who is more likely to use a serrated knife then one with a real blade) And he loved it the moment he took it out of its packaging, I have since recommended it to several friends and they or the people they purchased it for have been ecstatic. If you like to cook, are starting to get into cooking, or are just looking for a good knife at a good price I can't recommend a better deal for its price.  Its an entry level price for a really good quality knife.
