A little browner than expected
I purchase the Breville toaster because of the other great products from this company. The toaster is beautifully made and the power cord is exceptionally strong. My problem is trying to get a medium brown piece of toast. The settings are 1 to 9 so I guessed 5 would be medium. Wrong! 5 set off the smoke alarm and turned a helpless piece of bread into a burnt sacrifice. Both of my cats still refuse to come back into the kitchen and I had to use soft scrub to get the smoke stain off of my white cabinets. I tried 3 and it didn't even look like it was toasted. 4 burns the edges and leaves the center soft. I'm sure that 3-1/2 would be perfect but it isn't offered. My wife laughs at me every time the toaster comes out because she wanted the $ 19 GE toaster that was on sale. I'm sure it would have worked perfectly.
