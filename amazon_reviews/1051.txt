furi so called sharpener
The only thing this product has going for it, is their TV adds.  It is purely a piece of junk.  I didn't have very high expectations for it when I bought it, but thought I would give it a try.  I might as well have thrown my money off a bridge.  I wouldn't take another one if someone gave it to me.  Just plain doesn't work.  If I could have rated it with zero stars, I would have.  Try the Accusharp sharpeners.  You can get them cheaper and they work great.
