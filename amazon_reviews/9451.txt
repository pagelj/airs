Works perfect - need the you tube instructions
The kit came with everything I needed to replace the glass on my 3GS. Took about an hour - my glass was really smashed which made it difficult to remove from the frame. Used a hair dryer to loosen the original adhesive. Takes patience but yielded a perfect  phone. Bought from OEM Planet seller. I couldn't find the video listed as "instructions" but a search for "iphone 3gs glass" on youtube yielded several easy to follow how to videos. You must use a video to figure out how to make the repair. Very satisfied. Can't beat the price!
