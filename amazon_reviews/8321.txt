Pleasantly surprised!  (used as a baby monitor)
I am using this camera as a baby monitor to keep an eye on my child when they are sleeping (and for later one when playing in the room alone).  I do not use the audio monitoring as I already have an audio monitor in place with a handset.  The night time vision range and the wireless range of the camera is far beyond what I had expected at this price.  It really can see all the way across my nursery in pitch black without even straining.  The ability to monitor my child from my laptop or my iphone has been wonderful.  The ability to control the camera to scan the room or adjust the angle will be indispensable once we hit the toddler phase.  You can even view your child via this webcam when you are not even in state.  We've been able to give family members a link and password to peek in on the little one.  I really couldn't be happier with this purchase.
