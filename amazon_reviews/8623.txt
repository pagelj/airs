If you're looking to be a 1 to 1 classroom & love Google, this is for you.
I am a high school English teacher and avid Google user. I purchased the Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch). For the price, it's a fantastic little laptop. My school purchased 30 Chromebooks and because my students have access to them I've gone 100% digital this quarter. The Google "software" does everything I need it to do:**Google Drive** :: Yes, it takes time (and lots of YouTubing/internet research) to figure out how to share folders but once I figured it out --- OH MY GOODNESS --- my teaching life changed. My students and I use Drive to store our work. They share their files with me and I can easily read/comment/edit/grade. We've even scheduled virtual conferences on their GDoc! I also use GForm to create a modified gradebook; students "turnin" their assignment via the GForm, copying/pasting the URL of their document. On my end, I see a Google Sheet (similar to Excel) where I see the information they wrote. I click on the link, read/comment on their ideas, then head back to the Sheet where I add another two columns, one for their grade and the other for my comments. No more paperwork, no more carrying huge bags. My Drive is organized, color-coded, and manageable. I'm a big fan.**Google Sites** :: I create my classroom website using Google Sites and it works beautifully for my purpose and audience. Again, it's not as intuitive but there are a ton of YouTube and GDoc tutorials. My students have complete access to all the files/folders we use in class. I've synced my Google Calendar on my site too.**Chromebook itself** :: Like the other reviewers noted, the laptop wakes/boots up super fast (<10 seconds), which I love. My old Macbook Pro took FOREVER to start up (then again, it's really old). Google Chrome syncs all my bookmarks (which I have a TON) too. I prefer to use Chrome over Firefox or IE or Safari. And the laptop is fast. I've opened 12+ tabs w/o delay. The volume isn't too bad; but then again, I'm not a consistent music/video streamer. Oh, and the 6-8 hr battery life is divine for the classroom.**Chrome webstore** :: It's growing and that's nice. I've added many of my favorite apps (e. g. Dropbox, Minesweeper, Evernote, Pandora, EasyBib) and have pinned the few I use consistently on my launcher.**OVERALL** :: My students and I collaborate on the Chromebooks three times a week and so far, it's been a positive experience. I've even had four seniors purchase their own Chromebooks for college. Yes, there are kinks and this laptop isn't a traditional laptop, but for the price and what it's able to do in my teaching classroom, the Samsung Chromebook is perfect.
