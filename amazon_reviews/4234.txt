Best Virtual Experience Ever!
This movie was AMAZING!  It was less a movie and more an experience of another world brought to life through an engaging, epic story that any viewer would enjoy.  Need to see in high def to understand just what James Cameron hath wrought.  Excellent acting, wonderful, moving score, witty dialogue, beautiful scenery, epic battle, and emotion galore.  I've never seen an entire theatre get so teary over a tree before.  The epitome of what a geek, nerd, or Sci-fi buff wants in a movie, is actually enjoyed by viewers off all ages with all interests.  MUST SEE!
