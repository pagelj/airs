Nice, but different.
I needed a new computer mainly for speedily browsing the web. This laptop fits the bill but if you have never used Chromes operating system it will take more than a little getting used to. The real unfortunate part about this, is that since it has only been MAC and Windows on the market prior to this operating system, almost no software out there has a chrome OS option. As far as me having only used Windows before with this, in certain cases, down is up.
