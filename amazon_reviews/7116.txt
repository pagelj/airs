The Digital Photograhpy Book
This book is a MUST for beginner or novice photographers.  It's very easy to understand and the methods are right on target.  I've spend hours using the technics Mr Kelby explains.  It's written with a sense of humor and straight to the point technics. I give Mr Kelby an A+ for a job well done.
