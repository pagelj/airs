THE best science fiction book I have ever read
Hyperion is a wonderful read, almost as good the second time around. The first tale, about the priest, is absolutely spell-binding.  It has been my experience over and over when I give someone this book that they say they COULD NOT stop reading the first tale no matter what else was happening around them.  The story about Rachel and her father is also tremendously moving and harrowing, especially if you are a parent, but not in the way of so many books and movies these days of "child in danger from another person."  You have to read it to see what I mean. As you get into the sequels, I thought the story progressively became more strained and metaphysical in a silly way.  But you'll have to read them, because once you've started Hyperion, it's like a drug, YOU CAN'T STOP!  Enjoy!
