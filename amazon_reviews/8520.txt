Just what I was looking for
I have friends who have bought different chair like this... but non of them had one that met my needs.  Narrow enough so when it's on my back I can still see behind me when I turn my head, and it doesn't take up more space then my own width, as it.. I'm not banging into others with it on my back.  I bring my book, my towel, some food, sun screens and anything else one might bring to the beach or park all in the compartment on the back, giving me less stuff to carry in my arms. What did I do before I got this... I have no idea.
