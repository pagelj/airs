Surprisingly easy to install
I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to attach the screen protector and remove the bubbles. I have one speck of dirt that i can see if my screen is off, but otherwise I have no bubble and no curling at the edges. Definitely does not interfere with screen quality. I played a game and found that the touch screen's responsiveness hadn't changed. My only complaint is that smudge marks from your fingers are actually more difficult to wipe away than the bare screen, but it's possible with the no-lint cloth they provide. Quite happy with my decision to buy this, although I haven't used it long enough to determine how it holds up to scratches (probably very well, I assume).
