So Far, Amazing
After much research, and some misgivings, I opted to purchase this camera for a month long trip to Hawaii. After reading all the horror stories I was a little leery, but this camera performed very well. I spent 14 days snorkeling, and 1 day scuba diving (to 25 ft), and took the camera with me all of those times. I also had it in the water taking pictures of surfers and kiteboarders, so in all, the camera was in the water about 20 days. It takes great pictures and has a mind-boggling array of features if one is inclined to use them, but it takes really good pictures just on the auto setting. I did use the underwater setting all the times I used it underwater. The main problem I had with the camera was that it did fog up inside the lens when I changed locations - primarily from shade to hot sun. The first time this happened I was in a very dry area and opened the case, it only took about 3 minutes to loose the fog. The other times is was near or in the water - all high humidity areas - and did not open the case. These times it took longer, 10-15min to loose the fog. Being in a very high humidity area it would have been difficult to avoid any moisture inside the camera, but this is my only complaint about the camera. In the future I think I will bring a silicone packet to put in the camera when the battery is charging to get rid of internal moisture. I was very careful to soak the camera in fresh water after each saltwater day, as well as to keep the seal area clean. The day I took the camera scuba diving it worked well, but I would not take it any deeper than I did (25'), as I could see the screen on the back of the camera caving in from the pressure. I am very happy I bought this camera, love the fact I don't have to worry about getting it wet, and would definitely recommend it to others!
