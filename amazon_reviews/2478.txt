One giant cliche
I am rather shocked at how many people have reviewed this book so favorably.  I love a good fluffy romance, but this was just a continuous cycle of cliches.  The plot and the international drama they encounter were barely plausible.  Everything was tied up in a neat, little ridiculous bow at the end.
