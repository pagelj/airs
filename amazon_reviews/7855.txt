AMAZING!!!!
I got this as a mothers day gift. I tried pancakes in it and followed the directions that it came with. They were very good and perfect size for my little ones (2 and 4years) I then tried homemade corn dogs! Can I just say this machine is my new love! I took a package of Krustys honey cornbread mixed it the way the box said and then cut up hotdogs in small chunks (I used 100% beef ones) and poured it into my Deni and waited..... it was about 4 mins and I could smell they were done. I took them out and let me just tell you They didnt last 5 mins in my house. I think this is a wonderful machine, it is priced very cheap for all that it can do. It comes with recipes on how to make brownies and cake sticks and I just cant wait to try them. I have never gotten something as useful as I have found this. I can now get rid of my pancake maker and my waffle maker because there is a new Tool in town ;)
