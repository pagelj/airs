Great camera for a beginner
Compact, a prize or give away on many shows, this is a great camera for a beginner or general user. However, my only complaint is that the basic manual is on a disk, and who wants to stop their photo shoot to run to a computer for reference!  If one is not that confident about technology, it helps to have another person demonstrate it, whether a friend or family member, or go to a store like Best Buy for some hands on instruction.
