Love the camera, but can't dowload pics.
Bought this just before our trip to the Caribbean.  Worked great above and below the water.  I saw many other people had them.  But when I got home the horror began.  It would not connect via the USB to download the software.  Kodak says it is no longer available as a download. I tried to download the Share Button App.  This does download but the App does not start when you connect the camera as it says it should.  With a call to Kodak support, they told me the ONLY thing left was I had to buy a card reader.
