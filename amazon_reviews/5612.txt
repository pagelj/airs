The amazing parts of this book make up for the potential flaws; buy it
There are enough reviews out there that will summarize the plot of this book, but not enough that will tell you that at its heart it's not sci-fi. It's a love story, about a man who is caught up one degree removed from major world-changing events and the whole time alternatively pines for, re-meets, and rescues his childhood love. The setting, an earth that has totally changed while staying the same, is almost a character too and permeates every page of the book. Trying not to spoil: I'm not sure the whole Mars plotline needs to be done the way it was, but it definitely works. And the end will leave you hopeful. The more I read other books, the more I think about this one.
