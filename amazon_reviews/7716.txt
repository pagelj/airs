Bad quality photos
I bought this camera because of the great reviews.  It has some nice features, as do all the cameras in this class, but the quality of the photos is lacking.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I currently have a Canon SX100 IS that takes beautiful pictures, but I've been using digital cameras for over ten years and have not had another that takes bad pictures except for another Lumix that I purchased because of the zoom and good ratings.  I also did not keep that one.  One more sour taste was the $33.00 it cost to return this camera.  I am done with Panasonic.
