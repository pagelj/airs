Exactly as described
The product works precisely as described, was packaged sensibly & arrived in good working order. The software interface works quite well: it's intuitive to use. The microphone is excellent as well, a feature that I appreciate. I made this purchase to conduct virtual interviews for work and it does precisely what I need it to do. My only qualm is the image. The default setting has the image show you as you appear to the other party. This is extremely confusing as you try to get what's in-frame right, but turning it off is easy to do.
