adorable, unique kids flick
When I was a teen and babysat my neighbors, they insisted I watch The Brave Little Toaster. I thought it was going to be the stupidest movie ever. The title just sounded bizarre and pathetic. Well, I wound up loving it. I introduced it to a couple other little kids and they adored it. It is a very creative, unique story about a group of appliances who are left behind when their owners move into an apartment and their son goes away to college. The appliances go on an exciting journey to find their "master". I think John Lovitz does the voice of the radio. The toaster and the blanket are especially cute. I think this film is ok for any child. There is nothing truly scary. It is so sweet and innocent. I wish there were more well written, innocent films like this for kids to watch. The Brave Little Toaster is a great gift idea for kids 3-7.
