Works great, so far
When I purchased this watch I was a little hesitant, seeing how on other reviews people talked about having troubles with it. I so far have had none and a lot of people are intrigued by it since it doesn't appear to be a watch, which is great! Would recommend and will probably buy a couple different styles for different occasions.
