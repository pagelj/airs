Awesome.  Simply, incredibly, awesome.
I heard about WOOL last week, and got around to downloading this first book a couple of nights ago.  Immediately upon finishing the first one, I sprung for the omnibus edition with all the books. Hugh Howey brings us an extraordinary tale of an imagined world peopled with characters who tell, layer upon layer, the story of the silo they live in.  This is a book that makes writers like me say, "Wish I had written that!"  His ability to sustain suspense, use different viewpoints, and compel the reader to keep reading is masterful. In fact, WOOL and the ensuing books constitute a mystery as much as anything else.  What really happened?  What is outside?  And who is in control? No spoilers here... because I want you to have the fun of discovering the answers for yourself.  I just finished the third book and I'm about to dive into the fourth.  I just had to take a break for a moment to come here and tell you how awesome WOOL is! Read this book and thank the folks at KDP who have made it possible for writers like Hugh Howey to share their gifts of imagination with the rest of us.  He deserves every bit of success he has found. P. S.  I hope Ridley Scott does make the movie...
