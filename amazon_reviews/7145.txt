The best rechargeble you can get.
I have tried many differents rechrgeble batteries. No one last more than these ones. I have a Fuji H-10 camera, and with the others brand, each time I have to use the camera, the batteries had gone, and I have to recharge before use, they did not last too much also. With the eneloop, you can charge your batteries and have peace in you mind, they will remain charged for a long time, so when you need they will be there, ready to use. I always buy 2 sets, and keep boths charged, so I will always have a back-up during my trips.
