Not crystal clear
Do not buy this product. My husband used it for approximately 30 minutes before he got tired of trying to get his phone in the right light so he could see his screen even a little bit. The screen is very dark and does not allow you to see very well at all, especially when light is shining on the screen. The description of the product is very misleading. It also does not fit the screen exactly. Save your money and buy something else.
