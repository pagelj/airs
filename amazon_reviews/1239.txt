like it so far
I have been searching for a roller bag for about a month now-i literally shopped one night for a few hours comparing this bag and the jansport driver 8 rolling backpack. I almost bought that one but I read that it doesnt really have comaprtments for your stuff is what I really need to stay organized! This bag actually has a big front compartment to put keys, pens pencils, voice recorders... etc. I am in a healthcare program which consists of me lugging around books- this semester i think the books weigh 30 lbs total for 7 books... im not killing my back over 30 lbs! I am able to put all my books (even though I dont need every single one each day) my notebooks and also my 2.5 inch three ring binder. Im also able to put my waterbottle ( thought there was a place for it on the side of the bag; there isnt one, but both sides have two small zipper compartments) and lunch bag in there which is great, that way im not carrying a five things in my arms/hands! I havent used it since I literally just got it and wanted to see if everything would fit. Its not heavy as many other bags were reviewed as being 'heavy'. it glides easily (on my carpet) and like i said the number one thing was that if all my books fit and other stuff im happy! the material seems tough and durable as ive also read a few other bags felt cheap. A downside i didnt really like was the fact that you can feel (cant see because its zippers up and closes over it) the metal handle bars coming down into the backpack, as i put my books they just kind of sit funny beccause of the bottom and the backing, but i guess i really dont 'feel' it because its the inside of the bag just when i put books into the bag i notice it... the handle seems durable also- the button to make the handle higher/lowered seems good, not loose or anything like that- ill give an update after a few months of use....
