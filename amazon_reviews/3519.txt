Great gift for new parents!
I bought this product as a gift for my good friend's baby shower.  It is a great price being only $100 when it is originally $300 and most video monitors are at least $200 and are not that great.  You are able to order an extra camera too if needed for about $75 which is a better price than most that are about $100 for the extra camera.
