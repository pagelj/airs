A Cruel Jape
What a long-winded, cumbersome, mostly plotless disappointment!  George Martin seems to have gotten stuck on the eastern continent with Dany and Tyrion and lost his way.  Hundreds of new exotic names, places, cultures, and histories we have to force our way through just to follow the storyline of the remaining characters that haven't been killed off yet.  Hizar, Hizdar, Huzhar? How can we start taking sides in the palace intrigues of cities we only just learned about?  Why do we care?  Stop generating new characters and finish up with the stories we're already following!  Theon Greyjoy was a somewhat minor troublemaker character in the previous books but the fact that I was relieved when I got to his chapters says a lot about how bored and impatient I was in the rest of them.  SPOILER ALERT! Jon's chapters can be summed up with: he moved the wildings south and put some to work on the wall.  And got in arguments with Stannis and his men about it until a weak cliffhanger at the end.  Even Tyrion seems two-dimensional here. Everyone commenting here has most likely already read the previous four books and has a lot invested in the series.  And anyone commenting here just a few short days after the book's release was clearly as eager as I was to embrace this latest installment.  I expected to come out of this week short on sleep but rewarded for a long and patient wait.  Instead I'm tired, disappointed, and cranky.  As with every other fan, I really wanted to like Dance.  I did not.
