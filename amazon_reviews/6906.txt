I got this for my husband for Christmas. It had good reviews and was a great price (got it on sale for $25) so I figured I couldn't go wrong and I didn't. Of course it did end up costing a bit more by the time it was all said and done because we needed to get a coffee bean grinder and a frothing cup to use with it. My husband has been very pleased with this machine so far. But BEWARE we threw it in the dish washer not thinking and the piece that holds the little filter is NOT dishwasher safe! All the chrome paint came off it. Guess we should have checked to see if it was dish washer safe first so that's our fault. Other than that issue we thought it was a good buy.
