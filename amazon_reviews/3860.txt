First impressions.
Length of ownership: Just got today. Set up: Easy. < 5 min. Camera: Clear, night vision works well. All functions (zoom, pan etc) work great! Speaker: No one in house to test speaker clarity at the moment. Range: Currently ~80 feet btw camera and monitor. Works well. Hopefully will provide additional info after few days of use. Monitor: Picture is crisp. Overall - I have high hopes. I'll let you know if it lives up to expectations.
