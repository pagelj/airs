Great Case, but should be 30 dollars...
This case is good. I always prefer Amazon's Kindle cases because they fit snug, and in this case have extra features.-SNUG fit: There's no way that a Kindle will pop out of this thing!-Automatic shut on/off: The Kindle turns on and off when you open and close the cover. The only complaint I have is the expensive price. No case should be 40 bucks!
