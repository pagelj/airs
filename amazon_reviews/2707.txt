The Quest Ends!!
We got this toaster from my daughter for Xmas.  For the past 8 years, I've been trying to find a toaster that can actually make toast! Have a collection of at least 8 unsuccessful toasters!  I've tried some of the most expensive and some cheapies in an effort to get a toaster that I could live with! Success at last!  This Breville is amazing.  It is fast and quiet and you can see the progress so you know when it will finish.  I love english muffins but like them well done.  This is the only toaster that can make an english muffin  without pushing it down 2 times.  The chime to alert you when it's finished doesn't wake the rest of the house.  The "little more" feature is very handy, at least until you get to know the settings.  The only unknown is how long it will last, but, so far, it has been flawless.  I would recommend this toaster to any one with no reservations!  I did notice another review with an unhappy owner, and can only surmise that his toaster is not working correctly!  I rarely post reviews, but I really felt obligated to post this one so people know there really is a good toaster available!
