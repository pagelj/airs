Not bad for the price
So far after being able to use the screen for about 3 weeks I have noticed it started to scratch up a bit early, and there is some sort of grainy filter when viewing from a certain angle.  It did come with 2 more screens so at least if this one starts to die off I have more I can use.  I don't blame the seller; I will support the seller for future products and I also like how fast the order was.  I honestly can't complain for the price, at the store I would have paid at least $20+ for "1" screen, so having 3 at the cost of nothing is something I can live with.
