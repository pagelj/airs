What a great step up from my SX200IS
I don't understand the other reviews, really? Are you people serious?! I LOVE this camera, when I first saw it was "to be released" I started getting exited, I need this camera, the zoom was (is) perfect, the price, eh, not outta sight. Finally the day came, It was available to order, I ordered, waiting, patiently for it to arrive in time for our Disneyland vacation. It arrived. I was sceptical, bigger that I was used to, smaller than I expected, would it live up to my 200? ... Then the I took some test shots, garden pics, they looked beautiful!! So we were off to vacation, I took many, many pictures, day, night, motions, stills, portrait, landscapes, flowers, characters, all looked good but only able to see them on the camera. When I got home, I plugged the camera into my 55" HD tv via the hdmi cable, started the slide show..... The moment of truth! Did I get my monies worth? Risking a $4000.00 vacation photo shoot of hundreds of pictures of my kids, the park, capturing the actual "essence" of our grand vacation on a $329.00 camera? I DID!!! Breath-taking 16 mega pixel pictures adorned my 16:9 Full HD 1080p resolution panel (1920 x 1080) TV screen, flawless, gorgeous, vivid colors, absolutely stunning!! I was thrilled, all the photos in 16:9 format.  I couldn't get enough!! I was the most excited of all the family members, "look, you can see so much detail..." I was beaming!! Plus the HD video, It's OUTSTANDING!!! Great camera, for the casual or everyday shutterbug! I love it!!! Oh, and don't believe me?4/5 stars at one site, 4/5 stars at another, and 8/10 at still another.
