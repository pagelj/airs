Best hard floor cleaner bar none. My wife bought this at Kohls because she had a 30% off coupon. Took less than 10 mins to get out of box and ready to run. I cleaned our kitchen , pantry, and laundry room linoleum and let me tell you it gets floor clean as new. We have always been meticulous with the cleanliness of our home and it is a pleasure to not have to crawl around on my knees to scrub spots. All we do now is run this over it and sponge the corners. AWESOME MACHINE!!!
