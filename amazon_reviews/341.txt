This is our third steam cleaner. I like this one the best so far.  I love that you can clean stairs and upholstery.  I did that immediately upon arrival. I put this together myself... I am the wife and Mom of 3 kids and a dog and two cats (hence the need for a steam cleaner).  It wasn't too bad for me.. about half an hour with only a phillips head. I used the machine right away and it cleaned better than our previous two machines.  It is fairly easy to push and pull around.  I like watching the suction and seeing how dirty the water is and how much water is coming up.  I made several passes over one area and could see the water getting gradually clearer so I knew when I was done. It seemed to get really good suction without me having to press down on the machine. The carpets seem drier after completion than my previous two models. I would often ask my husband to do the steam cleaning because it seemed very difficult.  I would be more inclined to use this one myself ... it just doesnt seem as hard. I gave it four stars only because I have no idea how this one will do in the long run...
