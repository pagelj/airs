Highly readable YA story
I picked this up as a free download and, to my surprise, I read it straight through. The characters are well-differentiated and the incidents are captivating. This is teen fiction, but it held my attention all the way through. Obviously the negative reviewers were expecting more. For them I suggest Henry James. Surviving the Fog is very close to Swiss Family Robinson and it's a fun read in the same way. True, there's no plot, just a sequence of incidents. Yes, female characters seem to be cardboard stage props. Yes, the last quarter of the book wanders. Yes, it could use more proofing -- although I only noticed 3 errors. But if you accept the book for what it is, it succeeds quite well. I'll definitely try some of Morris's other books.
