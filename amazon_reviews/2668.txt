Well-Constructed Considering the Cost
At almost a fourth of the price for comparable mounts at local electronic stores, this is a great buy.  It is well constructed, but I do wonder how well it would handle a large, every screen.  I used it for a 32" screen and it was perfect. The instructions were not very clear, requiring you to really study the pictures; but there were not the worst instructions in the world. The built-in bubble level in the wall plate had broken off in shipping.  I thought about trying to glue it back on, but it didn't look like it was very well engineered in the first place and I figured I would just use the included 6" level (which was helpful since the level I had recently broke).  If you receive this unit and the built-in level has fallen off, glue it back on.  Even after using the regular level the wall plate was crocked and I had to readjust.
