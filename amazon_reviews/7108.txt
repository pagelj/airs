I spent a lot of time reviewing this vacuum and similar ones (thanks to Amazons many reviews on the product).  I wanted something that would pick up the surface hair etc,from my carpeting that always ends up breaking my expensive vacuums. This product does the job.  I don't have to worry about belts breaking and hair getting caught.  After this prelimanary I can then feel comfortable to use my other vacuum and get out the deeper dirt.
