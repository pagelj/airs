Great on the go charger...
Whenever I buy a new phone, I typically would buy a second battery for it. I tend to use my smartphones pretty heavily, and so I find myself draining my batteries pretty quickly when I am traveling, or on the go all day. With my newest phone, I decided to try an external battery pack... and it has changed my life. Not in a significant, spiritual way, but in a way that has made it easier for me to travel, and know that I will be able to power up my devices. The IMP120D gives me three charges on my Galaxy Note II, to one charge of the battery. It will take a while to charge the iCarrier, but it really is nice to have in my bag to charge my phone, kindle, or whatever.
