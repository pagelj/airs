Too similar to other stories
This short story's plot line is similar to many others:  girl has lifelong crush on best friend's older brother and he finally notices her when she's all grown up (see The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheevers).  Unfortunately, the story is too short for any character development and it's unconvincing.  Both characters are two dimensional.  This story is an okay escape for a couple of hours - less time if you find yourself skipping pages like I did.
