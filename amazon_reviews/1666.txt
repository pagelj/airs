Too much fantasy - Lack more real script...
WAIT UNTIL THIS MOVIE COME OUT ON DVD - SAVE YOUR MONEY. Went to the theater last night to watch this movie and the movie has too much fantasy and fiction. It is really for entertainment, of course! Save your money until this movie comes out on DVD. The movie depends too much in G. Butler to save the country. This movie should have been produced to be more real. First of all, once a unidentified plane invades the restricted air space in the WH, a squadron of fighters has the order or mission to bring down the object or plane  to matter what. Second, the WH has so many defenses around that a threat would be detected right away. Third, since 9-11 there is so much intelligence around that things like this will be difficult to accomplish... Third, USA does not negotiate with terrorist whatsoever! The US secretary of Defense, etc. will never compromise the launch code or whatever to save his/her life, etc. Anyway, the producers could have made the movie little bit more real... For example, a real confrontation with the US national Guard or army.
