Okay, I have to confess, I started long ago with A Kuerig and was very pleased.  Then I got seduced by all the new coffee makers that came out.  I tried Nescafe Dolce system... two of them... I was so not impressed, especially with the expensive and hard to find pods.  I also tried another DeLonghi system that was rubbish a month later. I came back to Keurig and I have to say... I will never use another system.  The B60 is powerful, gives you a great cup of coffee that is hot, tasty, fast and not outrageous in price per cup.  There are also many choices of beverage from tea, coffee, cocoa, specialty coffee and teas, even iced drinks.  The brilliant thing is... go to your favorite rmarket and you'll be able to find an array of k cup choices. This system is much quieter than other systems... that's not to say silent, it just doesn't sound like a 747 is taking off in my kitchen.  Then again, it is new... I shall update in 6 months and let you know if it tis still relatively quiet.
