This product doesn't work as advertised.
We just purchased two of these from Worldwide Distributors and are returning them both. The product is advertised as a multi region dvd player and we wished to use it to view region 2 dvds. We cannot. Both units play only region one dvds. Pioneer, when called, said they do not make a multi region player. Pioneer also said that some of these sets are hacked overseas to play multi region dvds, but none of the Pioneer brand sold in the U. S. will do that. They get many calls about this from disappointed consumers. The customer service number for Pioneer is 1-800-421-1404. I suggest checking with them before making a purchase. A note: We had purchased a different model # (still Pioneer brand) from VCT Electronics last year, and that worked fine to play region 2 dvds. Multi region dvd players seem to be a product where the buyer needs to beware.
