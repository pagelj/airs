Too bad unit dies, and replacement also died!, next replacement unit died!, Dont buy!!
I looked forward to buying this even though some reported quality issues in a few other reviews. But hey, nothing is perfect, there is always a few yield failures, chance of getting hit is low if quality is reasonable. I received the new players and my kids loved them. YET ***  After 2 weeks the slave unit (without the DVD drive) had the video die. At first I thought the A/V cable between the 2 units got loose as it is a short cable, too short by about 1 foot. The problem was not the cable. Philips online chat support was nice but it did take them 12 days to send me the replacement unit. OK, almost a month after purchase I received the replacement unit and the kids loved the dual players, UNFORTUNATELY ***  The replacement unit also had the slave unit video die after only 1 week.  UUGGGHHHHHH,  This is a design issue, my babies don't touch the unit, their is a defective design.  I just finished online chat support with Philips and they are going to send me another replacement unit........ Too bad the reliability / quality is very poor.  I would not buy again. June 2, 2011:  Got another replacement unit from Philips;June 17, 2011:  SLAVE UNIT STOPPED OUTPUTTING VIDEO! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEverything about this unit the kids love.... for about 5-12 days until the video of slave unit stops working!!!!! Note, my last Mustek portable DVD player lasted 4 years of everyday car use before giving up the data.......
