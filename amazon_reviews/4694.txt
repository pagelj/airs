All the Bells & Whistles, just OK sound.
Bought this model with all the options looking toward future needs. Don't need the cell-link now, but it won't be long before we ditch the land line. Power backup isn't needed now because we have voip (power goes, NO voip). But with cell-link, it would be very useful. Base unit is great! Not only gives you a 6th phone, but it is a secure non-wifi connection. All the caller ID, caller log and answering machine functions work great. The "talking caller ID" is the best. "She" doesn't start talking until after 2 rings and it takes another 2 rings to figure out what she said. So I just set the answering machine to 6 rings and NO problem. Compared to my old multi-phone system, this system is VERY complex. Just look at how thick the Operating Instructions manual is. [Kinda reminds me of Office 2007. SOOOO many great functions that it will take 2-3 years just to figure them all out.] If you are NOT a bit techy, this system could be a little overwhelming. So far, I have found the answers to all my setup questions in the manual, but in many cases, it wasn't easy. A comprehensive index (vs. a table of contents) would be VERY useful. That and the fact that the sound can be blotchy are the only reasons I didn't give this 5 stars.
