Loved the discount for pre-ordering!
I love that they gave the discount for pre-ordering (as I did several months in advance) and they even gave me some money back because it was discounted more later on. Definitely going to try and pre-order more books on Amazon from now on! It's a great book, and getting the hard-back for under $20 was a great deal! Fantastic series, Rick Riordan never disappoints. Really excited for the House of Hades in October!
