Short-lived bliss
After 5 months of using this toaster on an every-other-day basis, it just plum stopped working. Don't get me wrong. I loved this toaster -- it toasted the bread well, it was easy to use and although large (as previously warned by other reviewers), it looked awesome on the counter. However, right before work one day--- I plugged it in, put the bread in expecting another blissful morning of a fresh toasted bagel, when it wouldn't even turn on. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to problem-solve to no avail. Such devastation! So, I have come to accept this was nothing but a fling and it was worth it while it lasted, but time to move on to better products next time.
