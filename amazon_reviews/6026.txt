I was thrilled beyond get-out when I got my first Flair. It IS a good vacuum for bare floors of any kind and at first, it works even on small area & throw rugs. I dont mind cleaning out the cup and hubby blows out the filter with the air compressor hose in the garage. It DOES fall over easily and the cord isnt long. However, on each of my Flairs, although I have only used it for area rugs (I have a regular vacuum for the few carpeted rooms I have) the belts blow out for the "carpet" setting (beater bar moving setting). The belts were difficult to find and it took FOREVER for them to arrive. Hubby was able to easily replace them but they sure don't last. The bar gets clogged easily with long hairs (my daughter & I both have long hair) and I would often need to cut it out with scissors. I love how it goes quite a ways under cabinets, bookcases, and even my couch! However, it has fallen over so many times that the little latch to hold the cup in the vacuum has snapped off & I now have to use packing tape to keep it in. Its time to move on to something with newer technology!
