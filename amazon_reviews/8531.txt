Great Picture -- Easy to Setup and Use
The Roku 3 Streaming Player exceeds expectations.  I have been streaming video content to a Sony LCD HD TV directly from a PC through the VGA input on the TV.  Some content was fine but I never liked the display of movies from Netflix, etc. due to the "letterbox" look of HD formatted material.  The Roku 3 shows true HD format and the quality is far and away better than the PC display. I have the Roku configured for wired Ethernet and HDMI connection to the HD Television.  Physical setup was a breeze since the Ethernet cable was already in place.  Setup for content providers was also easy using the Roku remote to sign on to my providers.  I have several subscription movie/tv show "channels" activated as well as some free news, weather and sports channels.  There is a lot of free stuff available!  Many of the news channels have segments from current and recent shows that are available on demand.  Though not a feature I cared much about when I ordered the Roku, I really like the headphone feature available on the remote.  I have been using the headphones more than I thought I would.  This is a great product and I am considering getting one as a gift for my sister. The only "complaint" I have is that Roku requires that you give them a credit card number to activate the system.  I don't like companies having my card on file but I do have automatic alerts on my card so I can't get "blindsided" with charges and, anyway, Amazon has my card on file.  I understand the reason -- ordering movies on demand, etc. -- so I can live with it. Over all, so far, I give the Roku 3 a rating of five (5) stars and would recommend the unit to anyone.  I also give Amazon five (5) stars for quality and service for many purchases over several years.  I have always received the correct products quickly and have had zero problems with Amazon.  Thanks
