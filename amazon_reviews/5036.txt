Not just for YAs
This is an unusual, interesting, curious novel. Although it's categorized a Young Adult (YA) it's a story that will appeal to us "grown-ups".  A young man searching into his deceased grandpas' unknown past must deal with normal teen vs. adult issues to convince them that grandpa wasn't making up stories; the adults think these are Alzheimer related. Miss Ps' is a story of love, honor, truth, unexplained events, etc.---this is why it's a story for us all. I really enjoyed Miss Ps' & hope more adults will read it.  PS... the pics are real!--very cool. Enjoy
