Great Back Pack for the money
For my EDC purpose, I need a back pack that has enough room for a lap top, some extra cloth, power food, water and other survival items... and I certainly don't want to spend more than $45.  The High Sierra Access pack costs me less than what I expected to pay and the shipping was free.  The shipping time was approximately 2 weeks, a little to long for me. My overall impression was positive, the pack does not have any internal frame but I am very surprise that it was comfortable during several 40 minutes short hikes in town.  My only ripe is that the waist retention strap does not adjust easily. I like the zipper pocket access feature on the side, I attached some HD hooks and loops in this pocket and it is ready for the "hooks and loops univeral holster"...
