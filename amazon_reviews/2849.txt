Educational and FUN!
I bought this for my three year old daughter and she loves it! It has really helped her with her numbers. The puppy on the screen is really cute and the graphics are great. It plays songs which she has already memorized that help with counting and also says the numbers out loud while showing them on the screen. This toy phone was worth every penny! We are very happy with it.
