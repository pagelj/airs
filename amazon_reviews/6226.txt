Holy Cow This Thing is AWESOME!!!!
Where do I start?  This camera is everything it says it is and more.  For the money it's crazy! From anywhere on the internet I can log in and view and control this camera.  It is already sending me emails when it detects motion and has a sensitivity setting so it doesn't detect my neighbor mowing his yard, only people in my driveway or yard. Night vision works great (except from inside a window, it reflects off the window so it has to be outside at night). You must use Internet Explorer to see all the buttons (controlling sound and record options) but any other browser works for all other features (pan and tilt, snapshots, admin settings). Setup was easy, just remember to plug the network cable in first to the same router your computer is connected to (for those of us with multiple routers).  Once set up you can unplug the network cable and go wireless anywhere you have power (and range).  (Remember to go to the wireless settings and connect to your router and enter any WEP or WPA security codes needed).  Then you can unplug the network cable. If you want to view over the internet you MUST add a "port forwarding" entry into your router for the port you set up during initial setup.  Enter the IP address of the camera and the port in your forwarding settings.  You need to assign a static (permanent) IP address so you can enter that address in your forwarding rule.  In order to view your camera you need to know the IP address of your cable modem or essentially of your internet connection.  Easy way to do this is go to speedtest. net and look at the IP address close to the lower left corner.  Then you enter that address with your port number.  ex: 67.55.127.68:9999 where 9999 is the port you assigned to your camera and entered into the port forwarding. I will edit this as I learn more.  Hopefully this helps!
