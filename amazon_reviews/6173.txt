Not quite what I expected
From the reviews I thought I could eliminate cable TV.  Lots of offerings but not the real network news channels and not enough of my favorite tv shows offered.  The news is capsulized bits which is not to my need. I do, however, get access to many movies and does stream my Netflix subscription so all is not lost.  Many other offerings but most at additional costs.
