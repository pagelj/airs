Got this vacuum for Christmas and was excited to give it a try.  First vacuum that came out of the box made horrible noises when you bumped something.  Called Dyson and they didn't have a solution, so they told us to take it back.  Got another one that worked without making the horrible noise.  But, even though to generally vacuum the house it is fine, I do not like the hose or attachments.  I use my attachments more than I use the standard vacuum in my house and I found it a pain to use.  The flimsy plastic handle is no match for the heavy duty coils.  I found that it puts a lot of pressure on my wrist.  I also didn't find it very easy to use.  You have to put the extension up and it makes it just to clumsy to clean under the table or in tighter spaces.  I would also love to see an auto-rewind on this considering the cord is so long.  I plan on taking this back and just getting something less expensive that will be more useful for me.
