A fun novelty; don't buy this product for daily use.  Extremely noisy gearbox to raise and lower the lid.  Difficult asymetrical trash bag retaining ring inside the can often slips down past its retaining point and is always exposed to trash so you can just about guarantee you get garbage residue on your hands when changing the bag, and now I find the lid hinge points are very fragile and break, and the only solution offered by customer service is to buy another "lid assembly" for half the original cost of the unit when there should be a way to buy the broken plastic piece for $2 (Okay, $10-$15 by the time everyone gets their cut) or some kind of repair kit to patch the hinge area.
