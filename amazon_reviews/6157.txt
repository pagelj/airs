Great vacation bag!
I got this bag to use on our vacation to Disney, and I loved it! I was able to carry a wallet, 2 rain ponchos, cell phone, sunscreen, ipod, camera, and even some things i bought while in the parks. What I loved most was the water bottle holder. It was extremely hot in Orlando and always having a bottle of water handy was great. The bag was big enough to carry everything you may need, but small enough to not get in the way when getting on all the rides at the parks.
