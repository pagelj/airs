Choose another usb laptop cooling fan
It does a decent job of general, laptop cooling.  The loss of 4-stars in its rating is due to: 1) long shipping time; 2) no usb pass-thru; 3) incorrect product description (states 'one cooling fan' when there are clearly 3 small fans); 4) poor packaging; 5) flimsy product build; and, 6) a fairly noisy fan. Be sure to get a notebook pad with a usb pass-thru, so you don't lose a USB port.
