Virtually every aspect of this toaster has been disappointing. I purchased this product new. It does not toast evenly.  The right side is very slow to heat up.  The lift levers fall off or twist out of position, starting with the first use  (the chrome-appearing levers are flimsy plastic).  The first time it was washed with a wet sponge, the white lettering on the face of the toaster came almost completely off and only splotches of white remain. I will not buy another T-Fal product.
