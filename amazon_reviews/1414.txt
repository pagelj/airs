Perfect
I have a 13" MacBook Pro that I use 9 hours per day and this stand is just what I was looking for. It keeps it pretty cool throughout the day and causes the fan to run way less than it did before. Plus it just looks really cool. I originally purchased it after reading a bunch of reviews, I landed on this one. It's definitely worth the extra $10 or so.
