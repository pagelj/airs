Amazing
The cables cost about $3 when I bought them, and work flawlessly with FiOS and my Xbox. I've bought about 6 of the cables so far (just to have a few on hand). I keep them around in case guests come over, and if they discuss buying a new TV or console... I hand one out. Just to prevent them from making the mistake so many do of purchasing overpriced HDMI cables that cost around $50 a pop. If the cable goes bad... throw it away, get another. At $3 a pop I'm not going to cry if they don't last ten years. Or five years. Or even /a/ year.
