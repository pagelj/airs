I've used this toaster/oven for a couple of years now, and have never been satisified with it.  The "oven" is so small there is nothing that will fit into it without touching the heating element.  It is hard to clean too.  The door to the oven is really tricky to get opened without burning yourself.  When you use the toaster, it has to finish the time it was set on, you can't stop it early even if what you're toasting is charring!  The outside of the unit heats up also, so be careful about touching it when heated.
