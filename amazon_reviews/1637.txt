Works well on older laptops
I purchased this camera to talk to loved ones thousands of miles away. My laptop is old (2003 or so) so I needed a USB camera. It worked very well, no issues with the hardware or easy-to-install software. However, if you have a slow or spotty Internet connection it won't work as well (which is expected with webcams).
