Impulse Buy
I just got my first DSLR (NIKON D7000 W/ Lens). I saw this product and thought it would be fine. But with the lens and body i have to put one on top of the other. I'm also squeezing into main opening the charger, it will not fit into any other pocket. I wish I would have gotten something bigger but since I'm just strating out this should be fine. I will master the hardware I have now but any new accessories like GPS dongle or better flash I will certainly have to upgrade. It is easy to carry.
