Not as pictured
I ordered from this Amazon site (HiTech Vendors)rather than other sites because the picture indicated the card was in an original SanDisk package. Other reviewer said SanDisk doesn't warranty memory cards that are not in the original manufacturer's package. I received the four memory cards in a small static bag - not the original company packages. Looks like I have no warranty from SanDisk (or anyone)if I have any problems. They did come in storage boxes. Very disappointed that Amazon didn't check image used for the product so that it matches what you are buying. UPDATE: The above was written yesterday. Today we discovered these cards only work in a camera (why I don't know). We cannot load pictures from our computer to these cards. If you use the card in a camera they accept data. Now I have 4 cards for my camera but none to load with pictures on my computer and send to Grandma for her digital frame. UPDATE AGAIN: Decided to ask for refund. HiTech (thru Amazon) credited my account but I still had to pay return postage. Reordered from Amazon through Everything But Stromboli and received the correct card (in case). It works in camera and through the computer so Grandma will get pictures of the grandkids after all.
