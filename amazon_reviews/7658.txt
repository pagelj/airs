Fantastic for the price!
Frankly, when I first found this microphone, I was a little skeptical. The reviews were suspiciously high for a 50 dollar shotgun mic. However, I decided to follow the hype, and got it for Christmas this year. And I must say, it went beyond the hype (not a lot, but still). I ran some tests with it, and with this being my first microphone ever, I didn't have much to compare it to. I did with what I could, just to test the sound out, and compared it with my onboard mic and my iPhone mic. Frankly, it just blew them out of the water. The audio quality is very clear (I wouldn't quite say "Crystal" clear) and I can't hear any echo. It filters like a pro, and I've been comparing it via online videos to more expensive mics (the Azden, Sennheiser, etc.) and found that while it's not better than them, it's fairly close. Most of the stuff I have against it is fairly trivial. The packaging was a little damaged when it came, but nothing was affected. The mic has no "on" light, which means you'll leave the battery to run more than once. And, whenever I plug it into my computer, to record V. O. s and other things like it, for whatever reason, it's really quiet. I'm pretty sure that I can find a program out there to correct this while recording, but because of how little background noise there is, boosting it in post gives me no issues. Overall, this is a fantastic, cheap mic. I am oh so glad "Santa" brought me it for Christmas. I'll probably be using this until I've gotten my Canon T3i, and  then I might upgrade. However, for the conceivable future, I'll be using this mic, with pleasure.
