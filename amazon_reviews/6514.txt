LG BD670 Slow disk loading is not the problem, However...
Where as this is a nice player in many respects the weakest link is its lack of ability to understand ". mov" files. It's wonderful to be able to have it see and recognized jump drives and some file formats but a buyer should beware that it doesn't see or play one of the most common movie formats". mov". Another strange detail is that you can't just look at your jump drive like on a computer desktop. You have to specify that you are looking for movies, then you access the drive and look for movies. If you want music files you have to go back to the format menu and specify music, then find your jump drive and only the music files will appear. Same with photos. You can't simply see all the files on the jump drive at once. Seems very primitive but maybe it's some built in flaw that you can pay to upgrade later... That being said it's significantly better than any comparable unit from Sony. Better remote than Sony's however it's not great. Listen up product designers! If you can't make a back-lit remote use glow in the dark keys! We don't want to get up and turn on a light to see what we're doing with the remote! Kind of defeats the purpose!
