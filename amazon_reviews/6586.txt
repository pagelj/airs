A guilty pleasure
While this isn't what a professor might call great literature, it is a very well written story about people you'll like. I've read every book in this series and have enjoyed them all. I particularly enjoy books that follow families or a group of people, and Marie Force gives her readers that with generosity. These characters are real, each of them flawed and perfect in their own way. That's precisely what I like about them. It's been enchanting to watch every character's progression as these books go on, but this first one will always hold a special place in my heart. I consider books like these literary junk food, but that's not an insult. Sometimes there's nothing more satisfying than sinking your teeth into a good, gooey brownie... or a romance novel.
