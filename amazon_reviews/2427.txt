Now this is more like it! After spending hundreds of dollars on various espresso machines, I paid barely 60$ for this refurb and it works like a charm. It's not very heavy or complicated and works in my opinion as good as a $300 machine! The frothing tip is hard plastic and not that soft rubber that you have to replace every so many months of wear. The trick to getting that cool dense micro-foam with this machines is they brand of milk. I was using 2% lactaid but the foam was like bubbles, then I switched to an organic 2% no antibiotic or hormones brand and the foam was like marshmellows!!! Soooo nice from such a simple machine. The espresso pulls great with pre-ground or just your own ground beans, REALLY nice creama! Now I can begin saving money again with this little gem! Don't be fooled by it's size and weight! It gets the job done and fast!
