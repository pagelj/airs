This has proven to be the perfect way to enjoy espresso on our boat.  The aero press along with an aerolatte frothing wand and I have everything I need to dazzle guests with espresso and latte's out on Lake Superior.  It couldn't be easier to use, cleans up fast.  You do have to watch the grind- if its too fine, as it was recently for me, its nearly impossible to apply enough pressure to force the water through.  Wonderful and simple little product.
