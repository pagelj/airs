Scammed!
I ordered this phone and it came in what SEEMED like an official box and the phone looked new and everything and when I called to activate it, it was a STOLEN phone. This company is scamming everyone and I called the company to try and return it and they had an answering machine thing that just said "All the lines are full, wait to be with the next associate" or something like that and I waited for 10 minutes and I got nothing.. How are the lines full at 10pm on a Wednesday? I am so mad, I took a closer look at the box and it is so fake I can't believe I got scammed and I am just scared they are gonna take my debit card number and take all I have! This is BS!
