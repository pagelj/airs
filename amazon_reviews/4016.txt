Great little toy, no Youtube
I already had a DVD player that gave me streaming internet BUT it couldn't access Amazon.  Since I'm Prime and wanted access to all those videos, Roku it is.  Setup very simple, operation very simple but be aware that if you're wanting this for Youtube, too bad.  They just pulled that channel off Roku (some legal business).  If you do some Google you can find a way to still get it, but it involves your home computer, the Roku AND your cell phone!  Really.  This seems like a situation fluid enough that Youtube might reappear, but you have been warned. Also be aware that since some stuff on Roku isn't free, you must set up a Roku account with a credit card.  Apparently after you create it, you can undo it which sounds odd but there you have it.  Or use a prepaid card number with a small amount on it. In the meantime, between Amazon and Netflix streaming and Hulu and Crackle and Vudu and such, you never need to leave your home again.  And the universal search function is amazing.
