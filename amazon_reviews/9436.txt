Be Warned!
Before purchasing this or any Sony camcorder be warned that their HD file types are very hard to convert or use outside of camera playback mode. This is particularly true if you have an Apple computer. Your videos, as nice as they may be, will only import into iMovie. Importing them to Quicktime will take 30 minutes per two minutes of video. This makes the videos unusable for any purpose. I had similar frustrations on Windows based PC as well. You simply will not be able to watch your videos or do much with them off the camera. Sony provides no support for this problem and are hoping you will purchase the camera before realizing that you can't actually do what you purchased the camcorder for - watch your videos.
