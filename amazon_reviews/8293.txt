A great when-all-else-fails device but no place to store the connectors
As extreme events become more common, it's becoming more important to have a radio in the house that will work when else fails, including power, for extended time periods.  This device serves that niche beautifully at a very respectable price.  One of it's best features is the solar/hand crank charger, which can be used if needed to add some power to a cell phone.  The manufacturer was even so kind as to include a wide variety of connectors/adapters to make sure you can charge your device.  But why oh why did they not provide a cavity within the device to store those connectors?  Now I have to go find some sort of pouch that I can connect to the device to ensure the cables will be there when I need them.  A disappointing oversight to an otherwise great device.
