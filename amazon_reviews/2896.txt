Could not be easier to install, even for a non-tech persons like me.
I was a bit hesistant to buy this as it seemed to good to be true.  I installed it this past Sunday and have done nothing but rave about it to my friends.  I do not watch alot of TV, but having this will save me money as I can drop my DVR from my local provder (Brighthouse).  Hooked it directly to my TV using the enclosed cables.  My TV has only one HDMI input, and that is dedicated to my cable box.  Now to just figure out how to hook up the audio to come through my speakers like it does for my cable and DVD player.
