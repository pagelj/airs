Purchased this item in June of 2011 after extensive comparasing shopping. First ting I found not to be happy with was the brush attachments. The hose is so short as to render the attachments virtually useless. But I thought the performance acceptable, so I did not complain. However, today as I tried to vacuum, the suction was non-existent, the motor sounded funny for a second and then died. The filters were all clean and clogged warning light was not on. There was no warning at all of impending trouble. Upon tinkering it was found that the hose was clogged after all and it took me best part of morning to get it dislodged. Overall I'd summarize performance as 3 and 1/2 star.
