Using to somewhat replace a Samsung tablet(couple years old).  Talk about the screen clarity and good sound.  With the Prime this combo is fantastic.  Purchased 2,  and both family members are happy(i get the samsung now).  For a small device this is more than adequate for music listening quality but realistically I still use a stereo.  Teenager goes back to her room and likes the sound better than her MP3 speakers.  If music is what you like, really consider the Rhapsody app.  multi year subscriber to Rhapsody and the combo of the app and the device are great. Con:  only con is no wall charger included... foolishly purchased the amazon one but really don't need.  one family member uses and the other one uses one from other device.. Both charge. Daughter considered this and the Google Nexus 7, after research and product comparisons she chose the fire.
