Looks good, but still got a strange bubble along top edge
I followed directions, but I still got a narrow bubble right along the top edge.  I wouldn't really call it a bubble, but an area where it simply won't go flat.  No matter how I press, there's a bubble along the top edge which won't go away.  It's as if the cover itself, or my phone isn't 'flat' right there.
