Conspiracy Theory...
The book talks about a fireman and his group starting fires and burning books. They were trying to get rid of the past, they did not want to leave a trace of what happened before, they believed that the characters in the books never existed. That reading those books would only make us think and creat ideas that could harm us... Montag "the fireman" meets Clarisse, his 17 year old neighbour, and that changes his life totally. She opens his eyes to things he never thought of before, she takes him back to simple feelings, and warns him about the future... Montag tries with no luck to change that at home, but his wife "Mildred" is hooked on the sopa operas and reality TV. So he decides that something major has to be changed which takes him to do the unthinkbale with the help of Clarisse, and a professor... Stick with the books, they will make you see things this world is trying to forget, ignore, and burn on purpose. Great book, read between the lines...
