At first, this was the perfect coffee maker.  It brewed coffee fast and hot.  Where it started to go downhill...  For starters the hot plate started to rust, the coffee doesn't stay hot for very long to top it all off, the customer service sucks.  As I found out the device is manufactured by Hamilton Beach.
