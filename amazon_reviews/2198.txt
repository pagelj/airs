Aw Yeah!
Great knife set. Kitchen doesn't even know what hit it. I was lucky enough that I had no damage to my block upon arrival, and all the knives are super sharp! So far none seem to be loose in their handles.... and hopefully it will stay that way or I'll be upset. :DThe knives hold up well to cutting various meats: as of now I've tried chicken, steak, and pork chops. They are still around to tell the tale; however the meat did not survive. It was due to the pretty effortless cutting that made eating it much easier. But I digress! The design is very sleek, which goes well in my kitchen. I also like that the blades supposedly stay "forever sharp." If they don't, I mean it won't break my heart considering the price I paid for the block set, but I wouldn't buy from this company again. If I remember, I will update in a few months about the wear and tear of the knives. My husband likes to hunt with my father, so maybe I'll be able to add a wild game review to the mix by then, too. But as of right now, I'd definitely recommend this knife set, especially if you are starting out! :)
