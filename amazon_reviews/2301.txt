Long charge time
It takes so much longer to charge than my original cable.  I plugged it in at about 9pm at 9%, and by 8am, my ipad was only charged at 80%.  It normally just took several hours to get to 100% with the original.  Also, the wire at the port end gets extremely hot when charging while in use.  Although I do love the length, I prefer the speed of the original.
