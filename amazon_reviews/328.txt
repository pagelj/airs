Great leather cover
The kindle paperwhite leather cover fits perfect, I love the yellowish honey color. It turns my kindle off when I close it and it turns my kindle on when I open it, What a great idea. It is light to hold, It is also sturdy enough to keep my kindle safe. Just a well made cover, I recommend adding this if you buy a paperwhite. 5 star for a well made product, The paperwhite is the best ereader on the market.
