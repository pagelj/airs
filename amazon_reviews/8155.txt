Exciting and Entertaining Read for My 9 Year Old
The first installment of this series, A Whole Nother Story, is a well received kid's tale of the genius, Ethan Cheeseman, who invented a time machine.  The tale ends with them in scary old New England, 340 years ago. In this second installment, he and his three children have just arrived in the pre-colonial countryside.  Although they are coping with the death of their mother (his wife) and repeatedly find themselves in dangerous situations, the author has the family responding with humor and excitement as they move forward in time. While adults may raise their eyebrows at the fifth grade humor (not crude), the jokes sent my grandson reeling and reading aloud to whomever was in the room.  I also liked that the author infused the story with a loving altruism that made the characters both responsible and appealing. The first installment is available on Kindle for $1.79 so I hope this edition will soon follow suit.
