Coming from 7d and this is a world of difference
I love my 7d but its low light IQ was always a let down.  The 5dmkiii gives me the ability to get the shots that I was missing before.  The AF is complex but having used the 7d for a few years has helped some.  I can't say if it is worth upgrading from the Mkii but I can say if you're currently on a crop body this FF will blow your world away.
