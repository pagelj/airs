No problems!
I bought an Otterbox phone cover and tried using the screen protector that came with it. It was horrible and while I'm sure I probably just fail at applying these, it still should not have been that hard! I bought these as a replacement and they went on SO much easier. No bubbles. No major issues. Thank you for making my life easier.
