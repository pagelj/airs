It works for me
I want a toaster oven primarily to make toast. I mention this because many manufacturers seem to have forgotten about toast! Our other use is reheating leftovers. Occasionally we cook small batches of frozen snacks. After returning two Breville Factory Reconditioned XXBOV650XL  Compact Smart Oven (both failed), I tried a Cuisinart TOB-60 Convection Toaster Oven Broiler. It had great fit-and-finish and heated quickly and evenly. But it was impossible to select the toast shade. So unit #3 returned. This unit's digital controls are completely sensible and easy to use. It remembers your last setting for any function, so if you toast at Light+, that will persist until you choose another. You have read other reviews, yes, the beeps are a bit loud and annoying. Toasting takes longer than the other brands I tried. But I can consistently make satisfactory toast! BTW, broiler tray&rack tucks between the unit's rubber feet. The Breville Bamboo Cutting Board and Serving Tray fits OK on top.
