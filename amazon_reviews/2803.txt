It works!
Hello, I use this microphone to record my lectures in classes in small rooms and (literal) theaters with the Olympus VN-8100PC Digital Voice Recorder 142600 and it works. ProsIt makes an unbelievable difference in sound quality, I don't worry about not being able to understand my professors when I get home and listen to it. ConsThe black, spongy cover for the microphone couldn't suck more.  It ripped easily and it ALWAYS falls off, every time I move it I have to put my hands on the cover or else I will lose it forever, a mild breeze would take the cover off.  I might try tape. I would still buy this over again because it's made for Olympus recorders but I wish, really wish the cover weren't so flimsy.
