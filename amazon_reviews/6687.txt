The Best I've Found
I've worn glasses for decades and have been frustrated with finding ways to clean them. The Zeiss wipes are great. I have virtually no problems with streaks and smears. Just clear lenses. I've tried sprays and other wipes such as Bausch & Lomb and these are the best.  I bought them from Amazon but did notice them at a local Walmart for $3.00 (box of 50).
