As a beginner barista, having switched from paying for daily lattes at Starbucks, this machine has paid for itself in no time. We bought this machine after reading a lot of reviews... and we also liked the look of it compared to other models in its price range. Now that we've had it for a couple months, I can say that I do really like a lot of things about it. My only gripes: I am not a huge fan of the frothing wand, as it is hard to clean, and is an awkward height from the counter top, but it too works great. Overall, I would recommend this machine.
