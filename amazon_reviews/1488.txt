Excellent!
This SD card is an excellent card and has a-lot of storage! I have it in my finepix s1800 and it worls really really well. Great storage, fast to access, and overall a great card. I highly reccomend this card! (note make sure your camera/camcorder can handle a sdhc card and if it says sdxc it can handle it and even higher cards than the hc)
