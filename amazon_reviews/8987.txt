great little bag
this is an awesome little bag. not too big but enough room to carry your stuff. construction seems to be  quite rugged. they may show but when i was looking i didnt notice that this has not only the large compartment and the front compartment but another full size compartment on the flap for stuff like larger manual's and such if you carry them with you. as of right now i can not find 1 thing i dislike about this bag. and i would definitely recommend this to a friend.
