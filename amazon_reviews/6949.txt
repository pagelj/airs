Great Blu Ray player!
I was very dissatisfied with my LG Blu Ray. The load times were long and when I would turn it off it would not start back in the same spot, forcing me to have to find where I left off. This player has very quick load times, comes right back to where it left off and.... AND has the Amazon app for playing videos. As a Amazon Prime subscriber, that was a big deal for me. Had about a month now. no complaints at all!
