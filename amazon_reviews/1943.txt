Great introductory bag (for beginners)
This is a great bag for a hobbyist who doesn't have a lot of gear to start with. It will grow with you as you aquire more equipment. As a pro photographer I really liked this back for it's size and functionality. As I have quite a bit of equipment the bag is somewhat uncomfortable on my shoulder. But what should I expect as I keep most of my gear in it. It's prime market I believe would be outdoor/landscape photographers. People who are often on the move during a photographic trip. It's size is excellent when packing for and going on long trips. I have enjoyed using this bag. It's external storage compartments are an excellent addition. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a starter/introductory bag. If you have a decent anout of gear spend the extra money and get a Canon pro bag. It may be over-kill at first (depending on how much equipment you have to start with of course) But it will surely grow with you. As most "hard-core" photograhers know there's always some new "must have" piece of gadgetry we must have lol. [...]
