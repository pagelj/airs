this  is a super awesome toaster, though I am not sure if it is working properly or not.  not all of the elements light up and it doesn't produce an evenly toasted piece of bread every time.  but I like it.  If it were any more inconsistent I would call brevil.  I am definitely one to complain.  and I am not easily impressed, or pleased when it comes to kitchen appliances.
