Too much fun!
I love this thing! It loads up NOW! Its very light and silent; I like listening to music with 'phones and a noisy fan tends to ruin the experience. Not so here. If you're embedded in Google this is the way to go. I keep track of all kinds of stuff; surf; social plus I've built lots of docs using Drive. Really like my Chrome Book! :D
