The count-down timer on this product gets stuck sometimes and the oven stays on continuously.  I set the timer for 2 minutes to give some Eggos a little extra time while I went to the bathroom.  I came back quite a while later to find the oven still on with flames inside and the Eggos burnt to a crisp.  The entire oven was burnt and had to be thrown out.  I see now that dozens of other reviewers have noted a similar problem.  It's a wonder that this product is still on the market. Do not purchase this defectively designed item.  This is a safety hazard.
