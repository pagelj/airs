A 2011 Favorite
Positive: 80's nostalgia. As a child of the 80's, I adored all the references (and I got most of them except the most obscure games and shows). It took me back to a time of day-glow, big hair, and awesome TV. Like, totally. Positive: The Big Bad Corporation bent on world domination. There had to be a bad guy, you know, and IOI completely fits the bill. Not only do they have an entire department devoted to finding the keys and gates hidden in OASIS (called the oology department, since they're searching for virtual Easter eggs), they're willing to kill anyone who gets there first. Positive: The online world. It's like World of Warcraft and Second Life and Call of Duty plus every other game you can think of in one place. And it's free! Plus, when you're online, it's not just 2-D like nowadays. It's fully 3-D and, if you have enough money, can even include smell. Yeah, I can see how some people would never want to leave, if their reality sucked. Wish: That there was an online world as wild as OASIS (though I don't want our real world to be that crappy. Because it was really, really bad.). I mean, how cool would it be to fly the Serenity around Weadonverse? Or sneak aboard the Death Star? Or go on a quest for an Easter egg worth billions of dollars? Overall: A can't miss for anyone who loves the 80's and gaming, READY PLAYER ONE is an absolutely fantastic, unputdownable read.
