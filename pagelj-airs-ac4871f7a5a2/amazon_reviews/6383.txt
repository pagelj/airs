You have to try it..
I am not much on reviews but I have to tell you that I have put on many screen savers, and never any luck ( either bubbles or dust) I  put this one, and I was so amazed at how simple and easy it was. I will tell you take your time and remove the first layer SLOWLY (you can see it bonding), and work a few bubbles out. It looks wonderfull like its not even there. I hope it holds up to its name  "ARMOR".
