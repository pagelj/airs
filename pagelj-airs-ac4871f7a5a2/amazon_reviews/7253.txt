caveat emptor
Before you consider paying a premium on the Amazon Marketplace, read the fine print. The sellers have a long delivery window to get it to you. You have to wait 3 more days to file a claim then they could still could send it up to 2 weeks later. Hopefully, negative feedback would keeping anyone from doing this too many times but this is little consolation for me who paid a premium for something that I would have in my hands if I had ordered from Apple in the first place.
