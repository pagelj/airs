This is a good product that does what it's supposed to do easily and effectively.  The long cord is convenient and removing/installing the solution cups is straightforward.  This could easily be a 5-star review but I don't 'love it' when it comes to machines or scrubbing floors.  There is no negative to this product in my opinion.  As for Amazon... they again performed like Amazon; quick, efficient and a good price.
