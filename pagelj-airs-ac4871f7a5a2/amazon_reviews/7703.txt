Fascinating awesome!!! Easy to read and thoughtful.
I immensely enjoyed this book. Intellectual types like me and people who like to ponder new thoughts, theories, and concepts are going to love it. Much of it actually seems somewhat plausible. Very mind-expanding. If you're just looking for an action-packed sci-fi thriller, you'll get your dose of action and suspense,but also anice dose of philosophy on the sideGetting into the story is fairly quick and easy, which I think is important in a book. Easy to read, feels well-written, and captivating. Can't wait to read the sequel!!
