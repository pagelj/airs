Perfect!!!
It fits my Nikon D5200 and a (55-300) lens on the main compartment. But it also has an upper compartment that fits a lot of accessories, inclusive a snack that you may carry. There is also a slim pocket that you can keep money, memory cards and other papers or documents. Very beautiful and well made. Seems durable.
