didn't work
I don't know if it was a defect in what I bought it FOR or just this product but it didn't work! I bought a retro handset for my dad's old school cell phone for Christmas as a cut gag gift but something I could see him using. The handset was made for iPhone so I bought this converter and it didn't work at all! The handset worked with my iPhone but didn't with this adapter on his phone. What a disappointment on Christmas day
