Not what we hoped
My daughter was happy with this camera when she got it. The view finder is a little small and the pictures show up fuzzy but she enjoyed clicking away and it was nice to not have to share and worry about my camera. We have not even had it a year though and the view finder stopped working. Very frustrating for my little one. So much for being kid tough. We hoped for something that would last better. To update my review... we contacted fisher price and they replaced the camera for us and had good customer service so that was nice.
