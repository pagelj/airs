HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING !!
I WAS DUPED INTO PURCHASING THIS TOASTER BY THE HIGH GOLD STAR RATINGS.  IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.  I HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT SEVERAL OTHER COMMENTERS HAVE MENTIONED, I. E., SLOTS TOO SHORT; UNEVEN TOASTING, ETC.  I, TOO, HAVE HAD TO TAKE THE BREAD OUT OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TOASTER AND TURN IT OVER TO TRY AND GET A MORE EVEN PRODUCT.  AS OTHERS STATED, THE HEATING ELEMENTS APPEAR NOT TO BE TURNING RED IN SUBSTANTIAL AREAS. I WILL GRANT THAT THE BAGEL FUNCTION WORKS WELL, BUT I DONT CARE TO BE LIMITED TO TOASTING BAGELS!!  UNFORTUNATELY I GAVE THE PRODUCT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND KEPT TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION TO GET THINGS RIGHT.  AS A RESULT I KEPT IT BEYOND AMAZONS RETURN PERIOD AND COULD NOT RETURN IT. T-FAL WAS NO HELP AT ALL, ONLY TELLING ME TO TAKE OR SHIP THE PRODUCT TO A SERVICE CENTER 50 MILES AWAY.  SHIPPING OR TRANSPORTING IT WOULD ADD ADDITIONAL COSTS AND POSSIBLY NOT RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT, SO I AM CONTRIBUTING IT TO THE TRASH COLLECTOR AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER T-FAL PRODUCT.
