I thought it was going to be too big... but it is my most-used kitchen appliance!
I looked and looked for a smaller but still highly rated toaster oven. When I couldn't find anything that fit my needs - I gave in and went with this. I LOVE it!! It is intuitive and easy to use - my first graders have no problem operating it. It is big enough that I rarely have to use my "real" oven. It does it all!!!
