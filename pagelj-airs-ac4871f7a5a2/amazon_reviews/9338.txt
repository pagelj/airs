Potential Never Realized
I loved the opening chapter. To me there was something very compelling about a grandfather, the only member of his family to survive WWII, using stories, and magic and monsters to explain his experiences to a grandchild in terms he would understand. It seemed he was creating his own mythology, perhaps as a coping mechanism. I wanted to know more about that. Read a little further however, and we find that fleeing Nazi Poland as a Jewish child wasn't horrific enough for the story apparently - no, there are ACTUAL MONSTERS who like to eat to eat little children. What a disappointingly archaic story line. The book included several bizarre vintage photos, often manipulated by old school techniques. Again this is something that could have been really interesting--there certainly are a lot of creepy/funny photos out there--but they were misused. Most didn't seem to line up with the time period in question, and they also seemed to be a bit of a plot crutch, forcing the story's details to stretch around a few irrelevant images. I'm just not sure they improved the overall reading experience. None of the characters are particularly well-developed. The writing is essentially a detached description of events--I didn't get a sense of much emotion. Overall, I just didn't find much to engage with at all. Inevitably this book is designed as the first in a series, but I don't really want to read more.
