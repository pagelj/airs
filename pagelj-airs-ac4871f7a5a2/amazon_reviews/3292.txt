Saved the day
I needed a cheap CMOS 2032 battery for a Dell XPS 720 I was working on.  Other than Amazon, vendors wanted upwards of $5 for just one.  Amazon's price for a 2 pack was so good that I couldn't pass it up.  So I  bought 2 two pack 2032 batteries.  After popping in the new CMOS battery, I was well on my way to fixing the workstation.  Good job Amazon.
