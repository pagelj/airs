Low cost cable that works
ok, so a couple of times I have to double check how well it was plugged in as I saw no display.  After I unplugged and reconnected it was working fine.  Could be the cable, could be the unit output socket.  Who knows.  All I know now is that all the cables I bought work fine.  no regrets!
