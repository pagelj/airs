Skyping with my parents daily.
I got this camera since I was tired of using my cell phone to Skype with my parents. Once I got this camera and set it up in our home office (which took literally 2 minutes), I started talking with my parents and they flipped out how amazing we all looked. How clear everything and everyone was. I think the lighting feature helps a lot. I'm able to see myself on a smaller screen with Skype and I gotta say that I look pretty sharp! The picture looks great and its so easy to use. I wish I would have bought it sooner.
