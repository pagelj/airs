Interesting read
Interesting, not gripping read.  Cool ideas about the aliens but huge leaps of faith needed to accept how they communicate, how advanced the technology was (so advanced it's hard to understand why humans were involved at all), even how everyone moved through the rocky ice. It almost seems like the author was told to make his previous short story into a novel by a formula,  add in politics, conflict, some love interests, leave enough stuff for obvious sequels, etc and he did that just not with great depth. Anyways,  it was one of those books to pick up and enjoy when you are bored,  not exactly one that keeps you turning pages till the very end.
