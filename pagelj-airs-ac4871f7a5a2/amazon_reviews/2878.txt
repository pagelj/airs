Must-have gadget for every kitchen!
This is one of our favorite kitchen gadget. It was easy to set up right out of the box. The removable plates snap easily into the griddle. It takes a few minutes to heat up but it appears that the heat is evenly spread. The plates wash easily in the sink with a sponge. I know they say it's dishwasher safe but I feel better hand washing it. We have cooked blueberry buttermilk pancakes, thick cut bacon strips (see my bacon picture), sausage links, panini-pressed grill cheese and turkey sandwiches. They were all delicious. I love the Griddler!
