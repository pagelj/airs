Well packaged
Got 12 (6 back and 6 front) protectors. They were covered on both sides by thin plastic protectors you peel off so the actual one that goes on your phone doesn't get scratched during shipping. Fits great and air bubbles are easy to push out. I messed up the first time and I love that I had 5 more to get it right! GREAT for the price.
