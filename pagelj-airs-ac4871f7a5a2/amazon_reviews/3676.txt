Small, but does the job
I broke my previous printer trying to get out a paper jam, and decided to get a smaller one that had all the features I needed and none that I don't.  In particular, I didn't need the fax option. This is perfect for my small home office.  I know most people probably get it to print photos, and it will do that (has a separate feeder drawer even just for small photo paper) but for my purposes, the small size was what drew me to this. Keep in mind the paper drawer (the second one) only holds about 30 sheets of paper.  So if you are looking for something to hold more, this isn't it. One great feature is that the cover stays closed UNTIL you want to print.  Since I use this wirelessly, I can now print on my laptop while I'm still upstairs and not worry about running down quickly to open up the cover.  It does it automatically! It's also easy to set up to print double sided, automatically. I often print from my iPhone like this and it really saves one paper. I have had it for a month and so far the ink looks good, so I can't really comment on refills.  I automatically have it set to print on "draft" to keep my costs down. I have used the scan to PC feature, no problems. I have one tip for users printing more than one page at a time - use the extender on the door.  That way the sheets don't back up and possibly jam.  But if it does jam, the door on the back is super easy to take off, just pinch and pull the back door and pull the sheet out.  This has only happened to me one time, and it was because I didn't use the extender and was printing multiple sheets.
