Run Away
Run away as fast as you can from this phone regardless of how cheap it advertises for. Not only is it cheap in price, so is it in design. Should have read other reviews before purchasing could have saved a $100. This phone does everything else except what it's supposed to do. It dials people in your contacts without prompts, including 911 too. Freezes frequently. Makes sounds in back ground like someone is dialing but your not. Dropped calls so frequently I quit making business calls on it. If you hot on texting, this is the ONLY thing I found this phone to do well. Put in a few more $$$ and get you a better phone.
