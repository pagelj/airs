Love My New Kindle
I have been using one of the original Kindles.  It has worked well and is still being used by a member of my family.  I got the new one because I was going to be recuperating from surgery and I wanted to be able to read without turning on a light.  This feature has been fantastic on the new Kindle.  The directions were clear and it was easy to get started.  I hope it works as well and as long as my original Kindle.
