Unbelievable, simply and totally.
Ender's Game is an incredible story of a young Ender Wiggin, merely 6 at the time of the book's beginning, and through his young life of military training. The action and intelligence in this book is served with a giant side of emotion, and is an epic hard to forget. It is a great story and an amazing ride, making me wish I had my own Battle Room and army to command. I am looking forward to the movie adaptation this fall.
