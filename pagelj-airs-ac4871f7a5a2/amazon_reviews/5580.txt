Fantastic
I pretty much knew how good the D90 is before I got it, and it is everything I thought it would be.  I got it as an upgrade from the Fuji S2Pro (a great camera 6 years ago, so good I didn't feel the need to upgrade until now.)  I shoot in very low light a lot, and want to use available light when possible.  This thing looks great at ISO3200!  if you are shooting in low light, don't expect miracles from the camera, ditch the kit lens (it's great in good light or with a flash) get yourself a 50mm 1.4 or 1.8, and a Sigma 30mm 1.4 or the new Nikon 35mm 1.8.  The next step up from this in low light shooting is to go FX format, a D700 or D3.
