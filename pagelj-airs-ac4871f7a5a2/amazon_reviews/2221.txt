Can't believe this is made by Henckel!!!
I have several Henckel knives, from both the Pro S and 4 Star Series.  Henckel knives are precisioned to balance even in your hand giving you better controll while cutting, plus they are made out of the highest quality stainless steel with very strong, durable handle, thus the high prices you have to pay for them.  With those selling points in mind, note the price for this entire 13 piece set including the butcher block display.  At $29.99 the International Eversharp Henckels Series set is priced less than any single Henckel knife in any of the other lines.  And as the saying goes "You get what you pay for!" meaning, you ain't getting much in the way of knives with these.  They look real good sitting on the kitchen counter but that's where the Henckels standards stop.  They are nothing at all like the original Henckels so if that's what your looking for you will be highly disappointed.  These are light weight and remind me of the knives you use to get free at the supermarket everyweek you spend so much on groceries, if anyone can remember those times.  These would be a good gift for that wedding shower invitation where you don't really know the bride but a distant friend of groom.  They would make you purchase the bride a very expense gift, just be sure you never see her after the wedding.  Need less to say I didn't care for these at all.
