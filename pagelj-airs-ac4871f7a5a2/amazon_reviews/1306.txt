Very disappointed, a waste.
It doesn't work, I think you would have to crank it for hours to get it to charge. It is a small unit which is good, but that's all. I had an even smaller version of a different brand that was easy to crank and held the charge for a good while. That was purchased at costco, but they have since sold out.
