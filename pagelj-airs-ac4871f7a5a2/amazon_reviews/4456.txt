We bought this toaster because it was a 4 slice toaster and inexpensive.  There isn't much to say about it, it's a toaster.  It cooks the toast unevenly, so you have to stand and babysit the toast.  One side of the toast will be dark brown and the other side hardly toasted at all.  It's frustrating to stand there waiting so you can cancel the toaster and flip the toast around to cook it correctly.  This one also takes a longer time to cook compared to my previous toaster.
