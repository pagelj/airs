Little Box. Big Value.
We love our Roku. It took longer to take it out of the package, than it did to set it up. Picture quality is fantastic. Plenty of free stuff too. We have a couple of pay streaming channels, but I do watch the free programming a good bit. We are getting ready to buy another, to put on our other TV. Dropping cable TV paid for the Roku, and a years worth of pay-channel too, all in a single month.
