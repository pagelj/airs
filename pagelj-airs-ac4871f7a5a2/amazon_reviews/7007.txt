Only supports SATA2?
Cons:- I think this model only supports SATA2 drive speeds. I have not seen this published anywhere and so I cannot confirm. I tried using the ATTO benchark32 app and can only get speeds below 300MB/S, which is the SATA2 maximum. SATA3 is the newer standard and can go up to 600MB/s. I tried this on both drives (read below).- The keyboard is a bit flimsy. It's not really bad but definitely sub-par for a high end machine. If you're picky about keyboards it might be an annoyance for you.- The proprietary power adapter is expensive, if you want extras.- The tablet form factor is cumbersome and heavy. This is really more of a ultrabook with tablet-like qualities. Don't get it if you want a lightweight tablet-like device  with notebook-like power. There are other products that might come closer to achieving the latter description.- No VGA or Ethernet portsPros:- It's still lightening fast despite being SATA2. I'm not really sure if this matters when it comes to the user experience. I do advanced stuff like booting virtual machines in HyperV and they boot and run super fast.- It charges really fast. You can get to 80-85% in 30 minutes and get a full charge in an hour- Screen is very nice- Solid construction- The "yoga" hinge aspect is handy. I like having a good ultrabook that can be tablet-like (read con above)- Upgrading to 8GB RAM is easy (look for youtube videos)- It has a second MSATA slot so you can buy a $200 256GB MSATA drive for expansion and not have to replace the primary drive. It's a bit more challenging to install than RAM but not bad. I got it done in 15 minutes. (see youtube videos and make sure you got the right tools)Overall, I like this machine despite the shortcomings. Knowing what I know now, I would still buy it if I did not own it.
