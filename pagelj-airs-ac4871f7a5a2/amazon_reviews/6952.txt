iPhone 4 replacement screen
LCD Apple Iphone 4 Cdma"verizon" (Lcd Screen + Digitizer Pre-assembly Black) + Repair ToolsI dropped my phone while attempting to jot down information from a Sprint representative as to why their network does not support an iPhone in my area. The screen immediately cracked. I took it into the Mac store only to be told they would charge $200 to replace the screen. So me being the DIY type, I ordered this and it worked great. Follow the video to disassemble and reassemble off of UTube and you cant go wrong. Watch the video in its entirety. Great seller on Ebay.
