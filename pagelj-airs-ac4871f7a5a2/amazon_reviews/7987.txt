A very worthy part 2 of the trilogy.
This movie is good on several counts. First, it may be the third installment in the Brave Little Toaster trilogy, but it's obviously intended to be inserted between the original and "Mars," to tie together the Master's departure for college and his marriage to Chris/fatherhood to Rob, Jr. in "Mars." That development seemed to come much too soon, leaving us to wonder just what occurred in between. This movie carries a wonderful message about animals and their rights, focusing rather heavily on a snake named Mergatroid, a devoted white mother cat named Maisie, a disaffected rat named Ratzo, an elderly ape named Sebastian, and a sweet Chihuahua named Alberto. The music in this movie is extremely good for a sequel. We're introduced to some new appliances as well; a modem, female computer, some printers, a security camera in the police Dobermans' pen. On the whole, the main characters retain their personalities true to form, but don't have quite enough funny or poignant lines to allow this to come close to matching its original. Not that anything ever could. This is a worthy sequel. The Master is studying to be a veterinarian, a suitable profession. The interaction of appliances and animals is interesting. Oh, and let's not forget Wittgenschtein, the old super-computer! This movie was obviously planned before "Mars," because it explains how he came to live in the museum. Brian Doyle-Murray does a great job as the voice of this funny, nice guy. And it's a touching moment when Radio sacrifices his own WFC-11-12-55 tube to save him. The Toaster hasn't been the only brave one throughout these movies. The others have done some pretty brave things themselves. Overall, not a bad sequel at all. In fact, in my humble opinion this trilogy ranks right up there with Lord of the Rings; you've got the Brave Little Toaster: The Fellowship of the Office Chair, The Two Rescues, & Return From Mars.
