Excellent
This cord is great for charging your phone at your desk or on a night-stand where the Apple-supplied cord is just too awkwardly short!  I understand that in order to sync reliably the cord should not exceed a certain length.  In a pinch this thing might actually sync though (I just synced successfully testing it out).  Fortunately I am not counting on this for data, just charging.  It is not (and I did not expect it to be) genuine Apple, although the connectors appear to be high quality.  At the price of a Starbucks latte, can't really go wrong!
