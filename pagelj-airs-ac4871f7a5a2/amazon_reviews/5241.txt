Pretty good screen
I don't find it to be anti-glare in the sunlight, it's a bit odd how it has a glare and yet doesn't.  but tablets aren't usually good in the sun anyway unless you have a standard nook or kindle.  The fire and HD just don't work as well outside. Otherwise this screen is great!  No fingerprints show!!!!!  I don't know how that's done but I love it. It's also a nice feeling knowing that the screen is protected from scratches and such.
