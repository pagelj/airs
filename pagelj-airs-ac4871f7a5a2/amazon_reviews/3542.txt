This product has potential, but it also has a huge engineering problem.  I have had this B60 for six months.  There are only two of us in the house, and we generally only make coffee in the morning.  After the first two weeks the dreaded blue blinking light error happened and NOTHING we have tried will fix it.  This means that each time we want a cup of coffee we have to pull off the clean water tank and move the water around at the suction port.  Replace the water tank and away it goes!  This is "mid-luxury"?  Naw, don't think so.  This is an inferior product with no available fix.  The only way to put out a product like this is too little testing before selling it.  Poor, poor, poor!
