Not for Children
Really dark, creepy book. The photos alone are enough to haunt a person. Don't believe anyone who says it's "for all ages". Amazon is requiring that I assign "stars" to the book itself... which is unfair to the book. I just don't want anyone to unknowingly purchase this for a young person (as I did).
