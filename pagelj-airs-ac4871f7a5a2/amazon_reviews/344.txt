DO NOT BUY
It is shocking how bad this thing is. First of all it doesnt cover the entire front of the device. But that I could get beyond. The biggest issue is that this protector so gruesomely distorts the colors on the screen it gave me a headache. Its hard to describe it without seeing it, but it reminded me of those sheets you used to get out of a gumball machine and when you tilted them, the picture would change to something else. I will be requesting a refund. Truly horrible
