Perfect fit
This item is exactly what I needed to place my laptop on.  I put my calculator underneath and it's a perfect fit.  Even though there were no instructions to assembly the product was extremely easy to assemble.  Several in my office asked where I bought it and may be ordering one for themselves. Great value for the price.  Plus it's very sturdy!
