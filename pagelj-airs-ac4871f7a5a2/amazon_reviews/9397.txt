Why but an imitation when you can have the real deal?
These guys here are a poor substitute for others you can find on the web (basically, the similar-looking, but much better ones they sell at Photojojo [...]Yes, yes... these are half the price- but when did you *ever* get something just as good for half the price? Seriously folks, you get what you pay for! My Photojojo lenses came with a Telephoto (these do not!), the Photojojo Lenses came with adhesive rings I could use on my iPhone (these do not!)- and when I needed extra rings (after upgrading phones), they sent me some more adhesive rings for a few dollars! And- when my Photojojo Lens broke (from dropping it, which was my fault), they were nice enough to replace it (and super fast, too!). Good luck trying that with this seller! Trying to get a replacement on a defect was like pulling teeth, whereas Photojojo made it a lovely (dare I say, pleasant?)experience... I just don't see the comparison here- in my humble opinion, there is none!
