Sad to have it end.
Yes, I thought the story was too short, but only because it was just a fun, enjoyable read. It was fun to watch him struggle with his attraction for her from the beginning. Not wanting to care for her, but doing so in spite of himself. My only issues were the tendency to slip into the second person narrative. There was some first person as well during personal reflection. It was a little jarring. The other problem was, when they did finally consummate their marriage, it was in the middle of a fierce thunderstorm that she had spent hours in by herself before he found her. I realize he had just admitted his feelings to himself and to her and was relieved to find her alive and they were overcome with emotion, but he should have found her some shelter and not have endangered her life during her first time. Too dangerous. Overall good book.
