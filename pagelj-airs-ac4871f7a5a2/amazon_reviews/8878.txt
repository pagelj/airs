GREAT CHARGER... TAKES LONG
This charger is great given your phone stops recognizing the charger or the port to hold the charger becomes too loose (what happened to me). When I found this I thought GREAT saves me time to save up more money for the new phone I want. My only complaint with the charger is that it takes WAYYY too long to charge a battery to 100%. I could normally plug in my HTC and within an hour I have a reasonable amount of juice back in the phone. With the battery needing to be placed in this charger, my phone is off... FOR HOURS. Thats the only reason I gave it a 4 star. Its a setback with how long my phone now has to take to charge, but it saves me $500+ on a new phone right now, all due to the batteries. Would I recommend this product? YES.... BUT BE WARNED, THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME TO CHARGE YOUR BATTERY.
