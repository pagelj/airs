Inexpensive HDMI cable; works just as well as any other!
Don't be fooled by the price, it really is good! Honestly, I don't know much about HDMI cables, so maybe I'm missing something, but from my perspective, this cable works just as well as any other HDMI cable. I saved a lot of money. You should too!
