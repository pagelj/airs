Wool is not Fluff
I bought the eBook because it was cheap and could fill the 30 minute bus ride to work. An easy distraction and toss if it failed to impress. But I was not prepared for how engaging it was. It's been a long long time since I've stayed up past midnight because of a book but this was a pleasant discomfort given the joy I was getting from this novel. The characters are beautifully drawn, the plot amazingly hypnotic, the Silo mysteries haunting and the several love stories achingly and tenderly rendered. This is definitely a bucket-list read and I look forward to seeing the movie!
