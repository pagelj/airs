I didn't know I was receiving plasticware. It is sturdy, and looks nice, and is probably the best thing for my children whom I think are throwing my real silverware away! I have not put it in the dishwasher, but it washes up just fine. I like the fact that there is no attachment to it, and no expectation to use it beyond once or twice. If I get more out of it, well hey.... it paid for itself many times over.
