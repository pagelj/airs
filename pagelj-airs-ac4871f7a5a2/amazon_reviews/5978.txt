Loved it..!!
I was looking for a real good wheeled backpack, and was researching over the internet; and this backpack kinda caught my attention. This is one of the best backpack one could ever have. Its spacious, the wheels are good, and the bag stands straight and does not fall down like other cheap products. The quality of the bag is incredible, i love the texture. It has lot of pockets and you can keep a whole lot of stuff in there, the handle is strong enough to bear the load. The shoulder straps easily fit in the slot made for it at the back of the bag and when you are rolling your backpack, there is no way that the straps could get into the wheels; which is great. I have been using it for last 2 and half weeks and it seems to be working perfect for me. I love the rich charcoal red color. My colleagues were impressed with my choice and even though its a bit pricy, its worth it. You have great deals on amazon and you might want to keep an eye on the price, as sometimes, they put real good deals.!! I loved my backpack.. I now know, I made the right choice!!
