Very satisfied.
This is the first product I bought on Amazon about two years ago. I'm still using it and it still gives me high quality signal from my Play Station 3 to my High Definition LED TV. The signal is the same as any other $90+ cable. Don't be fooled by brand names, this works just as well. I love it, and it's dirt cheap. Highly, highly recommended.
