Couldn't Put it Down, A Must Read
A friend recommended this book to me and having never read a Francine Rivers novel I didn't know what to expect. I absolutely could not put it down and have gone on to read most of her other books. It is a great love story about forgiveness, faith, and a love that endures. It also reminds us to listen to that inner voice that guides us. I would rank this book right up their with one of my other favorites, The Notebook.
