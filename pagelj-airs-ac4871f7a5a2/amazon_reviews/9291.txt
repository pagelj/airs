A Good Bargain
I purchased this for my wife as a birthday present. Neither she nor I are expert photographers.  With the include instructions and the Auto setting we have been able to get some great shots and are hoping to get better.  Easy to use, good zoom and fine pixel quality.  Like most digital cameras it's a little hard on batteries, so we carry 4 rechargeables if we leave the house.  No complaints!  Would recommend this to anyone who is not in the market for a professional rig but wants quality candid/family photos.
