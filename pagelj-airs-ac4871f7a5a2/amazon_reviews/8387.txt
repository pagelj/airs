This cellphone does not worth even $100
I usually don't write any review, but I am really unsatissfied with this phone. First, it takes as long as 1 minute or longer to turn on and load the first page.2. the battery is horrible even you put in a brand new battery. I bought an used HTC from the seller, but the seller gave me an new batterary, due to HTC is knows with short battery. But it still horrible even you put in a brand new battery. If you are luck, 3 hours talk time. if you just use it to browsing web and access android market,... you would get about 3 hours as well.3. the Micro SD slot in locate in a ridiculous place. It locates below the battery. I usually have one micro SD to store my music and I switch it between all my device. I hate I have to open up back cover, take out battery, and insert and take up Micro SD card all the time. Expecially, I have to take charger and looking for power outlet all the time.4. The used HTC doesnot come with 8 GB micro SD card. It only have 360 MB available internal memory to start with.5. Screen freeze too often and it does not response to fingers very well as well. I returned the itemThe seller should pay people to buy their phone. It doesn't worth $135.00 investiment.
