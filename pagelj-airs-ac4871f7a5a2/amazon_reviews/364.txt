Closer to the original short story than the one with Sean Astin, but not worth the price.
Whether or not you're a Kurt Vonnegut fan doesn't take into account how much it costs to either rent or buy this twenty seven minute short-film. It is not like you are getting a full-on cast like a movie or tv series. A couple of the lines are switched, and a lot of the shots are just long, silent sections. Reading the short story was more fulfilling than watching this short movie.
