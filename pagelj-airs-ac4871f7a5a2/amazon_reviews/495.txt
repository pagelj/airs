Interesting, but anachronistic
I never read this book until recently. I can see why it is a classic in sci-fi, and I greatly enjoyed the detail it gets to with the physics, especially the time dilation that is the centerpiece of the book. The Vietnam allegory is very transparent to the point of seeming amateurish. The author's obsession with sexual orientation alternates between amusingly juvenile and disturbing. Also, while it is only mentioned occasionally, women being required to have sex with men on demand, by law (early in the book, assumedly not went Earth switched to a "homo life" norm; his word, not mine) is simply creepy. Also, the omnipresence of legalized drugs dates this book badly as well. While an interesting story worth reading, it has aged badly. The anachronistic viewpoints and society of the 70's are distracting at the least. Also, almost all of the technology is out of place, being too primitive at the start and painfully so at the end, given that a thousand years have passed.
