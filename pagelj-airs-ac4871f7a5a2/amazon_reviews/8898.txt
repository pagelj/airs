great ultra with 10x zoom
This camera seems to have it all, bought a second one for a relative. I have had cameras in the past that every time I went to use it I went back to the manual, but the interface on this model is relatively simple.  The only downside is the skimpy manual, I found it easier to read some reviews and reference the on-line manual. We have taken a few hundred pics so far and they are great. Fits in your shirt pocket, easy to use, great features, great zoom and great pics.
