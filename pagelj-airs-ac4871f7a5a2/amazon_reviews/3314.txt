My other iTouchless trash can stopped working after 2 years of use.  We liked it so much we decided to get a new one.  Got this one for a much lower price than we paid for the original. Based on past experience, my only bit of advice is to not block or impeded the movement of the lid.  The gear assembly inside appears to be somewhat fragile and you can strip them if you try to stop the lid from moving. Otherwise, great product. No hands touching the trash can = no germs.
