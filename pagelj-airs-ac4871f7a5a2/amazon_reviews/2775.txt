Zoom Zoom!
Great piece of glass at a competitive price. I needed something with a little more reach but I didn't want to break the bank. The Image Stabilization is a very nice and handy feature when shooting at full zoom by hand and very noticeable when it is turned on. It is reported to use more battery when enabled but you can of course turn it on and off as needed. The lens is solid and has a bit of weight to it but not so much to make shooting with it at  all uncomfortable. The picture quality is great and falls in line with what I have come to expect from Canon glass.
