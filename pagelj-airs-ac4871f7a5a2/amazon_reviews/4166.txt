Not for Me
I feel like I might be the only person in the world who does not like the Ipad 2. Basically, its functionality is somewhere between an iphone and a laptop. The first issue that I have with it is that it is expensive and does not fit in my pocket. That means that if I go to town, I really can not take it with me because I would be afraid if I set it down or took my eyes off of it for a minute it would get stolen. I can not walk around holding it all day, so pretty much I have to leave it at home. When I am at home, I have a computer in just about every room, so really dont know what I need the ipad for. It does not really do anything that a computer does not already do. When I travel, space in the carry on bag is a premium. I tried travelling once with this, and leaving the laptop at home, and it was a disaster. It will handle routine email, but if you need to edit a document, or interact with a web site that has flash, you are out of luck. I went to Africa with this instead of a laptop, and ended up on the phone for long periods trying to get someone back in the states to handle the business items I could not do on the ipad. So, when I travel if I already have to take an iphone and a laptop, what niche does the ipad fill? In optimizing my carry on for travel, I take an iphone, a small laptop, a good Sony camcorder, and the canon powershot elph. The ipad gets left home. Bottom line is that I would not buy another one.
