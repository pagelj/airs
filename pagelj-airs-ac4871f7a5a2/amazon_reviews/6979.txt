Very nice!
Good instructions. I'd add to them to be careful not to bend the plastic when peeling it off to reposition the protector. I did and realized that it kept popping back up at the top of the phone!  Grrrr really mad at myself then I realized that they had counted on someone like me and had included 2 more chances. Forewarned the 2nd time I got it right. Very clear - can not tell it is on the phone!  Recommend it highly.
