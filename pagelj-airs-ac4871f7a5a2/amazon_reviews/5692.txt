Small & compact, but not as sticky as needed.
This phone mount is compact and can be positioned in many different angles. At first it worked great and held on to the dash tightly. However, when I decided to place it in a different location, it wouldn't adhere tightly anymore. I followed the instructions and rinsed the sticky pad with water and let dry, but it just hasn't been strong enough to stick let alone hold my phone anymore.  My advice, don't move it!
