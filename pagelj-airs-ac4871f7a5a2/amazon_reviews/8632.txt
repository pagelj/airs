Love this new dustbuster!  Super powerful, easy to hold/use, love the easier plug vs. the annoying charging station of old, and love that the tools are already attached (you just flip out the brush or pull out the nozzle).  Have only had it a week, so true test will be how long the suction lasts, but it's a seriously huge improvement on all previous versions of the dustbuster!
