A love letter to my childhood
Read Player One is crack for the 80's nerd's brain, which will soak up every word while the head it resides in nods along, agreeing with the overwhelming sense of, "Yeah, I remember that. Wow."The details in the novel are top notch, with every minute geek factoid presented with the care of a research paper, yet the poetic flow that only someone deeply in love with their source material could bring. If you are a child of the 80's, a science fiction fan, or just wonder what nonsense inside jokes your parents throw out that you're vaguely sure are Star Wars related, read this.
