I could not wait for this to arrive and get that first cup of coffee.  After years of (and lots of..)"drip" coffeemakers, it was great to be back to the basics.  The coffee was aromatic, smooth, HOT and NOT a disappointment... not to mention the sound of perking coffee in the morning!  Like welcoming back an old friend! The only draw back would be, that there is no automatic shut-off.  It is very easy to forget that it's still on when you leave the house... come on Presto... if you can make coffee taste this wonderful, surely that is something that can be looked into :)!  Amazon, thank you for super fast delivery!
