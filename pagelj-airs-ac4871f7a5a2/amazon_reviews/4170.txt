I am very pleased with this player.  Older sony remotes open and close the tray
I am very pleased with my new Sony dvd player.  I discovered by accident, my old sony remote to an older sony dvd player, will open and close the tray door on this new model player.  The older sony dvd remote also works all basic functions, like turning the new unit on and off, play, stop, etc.
