Love it!
I love this backpack.  I got it because my daughter was moved into the pre-toddler room at daycare andthey keep their stuff in backpacks.  This fit on her perfectly, although it threw her off balance so normally I carry it.  It's very thick material so I see it lasting for quite some time.  Super cute and we get lots of complements on it.
