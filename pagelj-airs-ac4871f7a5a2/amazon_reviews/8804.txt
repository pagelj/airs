Great mount but...
I love this mount, it holds my 60" led tv almost flush against the wall, yet still allows for tilt adjustment... but... Because its so close to the wall, I'm not able to reach the bottom screws that secure the tv to the mount. If someone bumps it, or there's an earthquake, the tv is probably going down. Luckily I'm in an area where I don't need to worry much about that :-)
