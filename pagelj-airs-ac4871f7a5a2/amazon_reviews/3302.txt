Quality and Value yes.
I have an Ipod 2nd generation and I think this is the best screen protector I have gotten. I was surprised of how many you get for the price. It was a five pack and I have only used one so far it has been about six weeks and I have'nt seen any scratches yet. Great price and quality. thanks!
