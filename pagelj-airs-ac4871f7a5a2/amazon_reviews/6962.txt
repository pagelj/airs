Grandaughter Loved It!!
Gave this to my three year old grandaughter before she started PreSchool.  She loved it.  Wore it all day and wanted to wear it to bed.  Size was perfect  Large enough to carry spare clothes and any papers she may bring home, but not so large that it overwhelmed her.  Quality was very good.
