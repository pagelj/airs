Great HD- Wi-Fi device
I bought this Blu-Ray (Panasonic DMP-BDT320) to replace my "dinosaur" Toshiba HD-DVD format player. I had a slight advantage over some of the other reviewers in that my television is a Panasonic Viera plasma unit. As soon as the BDT320 was attached via HDMI cable, my Viera TV remote "syncronized" automatically with the BDT320 and I was able to easily do the complete set up within 10 minutes with the Viera's remote (including all Wi-Fi online apps. and disc eject). Picture quality with Blu-Ray discs was almost as good as the HD-DVD playback on the Toshiba. With a few adjustments, the picture quality exceeded the HD-DVD playback quality on the Toshiba. The internet and streaming apps were easy and worked well. My only complaint is that I wish there was an update available from Panasonic to play the excellent but extinct HD-DVD format on this player. I suppose I will get around to playing with the "controversial" remote that came with the player at a later date. If you have a Panasonic TV, the remote is not an issue at all, just something to play around with in your spare time to see if you like it. Hope this helps
