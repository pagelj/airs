What can I say about this ink?!?
It is always a lot of fun to review a product that you either need or you don't.  If you have one of the Canon printers that requires this ink - as I do - you either use it or you don't.  (If you don't, you won't be able to print out this five-star review!)Seriously, though, from my long experience with Canon printers (and other products), I highly recommend purchasing these genuine Canon ink cartidges.  The quality always seems to be better than the do-it-yourself refills or the off-brand refills from other sellers.  (I have nothing against these refill-sellers - in fact, not only do I wish that the quality was as reliable, but I highly recommend that you recycle the empty OEM cartidges so that they can be re-used in the refill market.)The Canon ink that I bought here from Amazon is very reasonably priced, and is the high-quality stuff.  My black printouts seem blacker, my yellows more yellow, and I am sure that (when I replace the cyan cartridge) the cyans will be cyan-er.  (For New Englanders, I would like to say that the magentas are more magenter.)Enjoy your Canon ink.  (Hopefully, you also enjoyed this goofy late night review, too!)
