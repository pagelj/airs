Love this Camera
I just don't know how I can be objective in this review, because I just plain love this camera. The video quality is as good an anything I've ever seen and thanks, I suppose, to it's back illuminated sensor, it's takes gorgeous video in very low light. Add the 30x optical zoom which lets me zoom right in on my kids and also add the face detection software that's built into the camera so the kids are perfectly in focus and you have the kind of a video camera every mom would love. I can't say enough good about this camera and I can't recommend it highly enough.
