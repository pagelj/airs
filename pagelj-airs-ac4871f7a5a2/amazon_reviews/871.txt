Review of SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter
Workable card, but not really class 10 UHS-1Cons:Testing the card with the (universally recognized) H2testw flash drive tester, my card(with included adapter) registered the following speeds:Write:  9.13 Mbytes / SecRead:  16,7 Mbytes / SecThis performance falls short of the expected 10 MB/s Read and 30 MB/s Writecapabilities of the card - but the included adapter may have caused sub-optimal preformancePros:Card works perfectly in my new LG840g - and since I'm not shooting HD videos with the camera,it should work fine.  Only had it for a month, no problems so far.  Also, no overheating problemsnoticed during comprehensive read/write test.  Would recommend -  but with a rating of 3.5 stars
