So far, it is great.
I haven't had a chance to use the camera, but for what I have shot this appears to be on the path of "Just exactly what I wanted" in a good lens, good features, and full of functions without having an SLR which would tempt me to buy additional lens to lug around. I'd be glad to add more after I've used the camera more.
