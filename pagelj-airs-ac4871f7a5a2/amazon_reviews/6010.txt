Exactly as described. Great Value.
This monitor stand is great! My company won't buy these for their employees so I took a risk with my own money to purchase this. I am very impressed with what I received. The build quality is excellent. At its core this is a very sturdy, heavy-duty piece of equipment. Without help it can be a little difficult to install the monitors and adjust the height. The height is adjusted with a clamp and the rest of the adjustment joints in the arms are friction based, so it can be a bit of a workout to adjust the monitors. Once they are where you want them though, there is no chance of them moving out-of-place.
