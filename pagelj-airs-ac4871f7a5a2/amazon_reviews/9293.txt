Great book for gamers, geeks, nerds, and 80's enthusists.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially since it took me back in to my childhood.  Playing a vast amount of Atari games, playing on Tandy's and Commodore 64's with 5 1/4" disks that took around five disks just to play Ghostbusters and G. I. Joe: A Real American Hero.  Plenty of references to 80's music, pop culture, and things to help you remember the good ol' days for some.
