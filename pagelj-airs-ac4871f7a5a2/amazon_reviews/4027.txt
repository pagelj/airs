Cheap and works great, not just for Motorola phones.
There isn't much to say about this. I bought two of these (one for me, one for someone else) and they both work just great. They charge our two phones quickly and the blue light is a nice touch. Note that neither of our phones are Motorola's (Samsung Epic 4g and a Sanyo SCP-3810) and the charger works fine. On paper at least, it should work with any phone that uses the micro USB standard for charging and my anecdotal experience back this up. Long story short, if you need a car charger for your micro USB phone, this is a solid, name brand charger for a cheap price and a great choice.
