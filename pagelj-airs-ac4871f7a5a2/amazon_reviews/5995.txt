Pleased with product. Setup was a pain due to poor instructions
The manual should definitely include the following:1. Factory setting IP is 192.168.0.178, the http port is 80.2. Connect the pc with the included cross-over cable to the ethernet port of the webcam.3. Change the IP address of your ethernet interface, IP address of your 192.168.0.177, subnet mask 255.255.255.0 and gateway 192.168.0.1784. Open your browser and type [...] and press enter.5. Once you assign the webcam a new IP address, you'll need to reassign your ethernet IP also to match also (if you change the camera to 192.168.1.111, set your ethernet to 192.168.1.112)The rest is self explanatory if you can get to this point.  Just follow the onscreen instructions.  After you're all done, don't forget to change your ethernet IP back to its correct setting. Other than the setup, I am happy with the product.  Night vision motion activated recording works well.
