Total junk!
I can't believe anyone said this scale is accurate. The way it works is that there is a tiny lever under the flat part of the cup shaped plate. You have to put your material directly over it, not in the cup. If you put things in the cup it will change depending on how you relocate them. If you put the calibration weights in the cup (as shown) you will never get the 5g and 10g weights! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
