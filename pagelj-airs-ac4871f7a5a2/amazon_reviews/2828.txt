ZERO STARS! This is dangerous!
I was severely burned when I used this waffle iron. I thought it was a lot safer to use than it actually is. It has no safety features at all and you cannot come in contact with the outside of it when it is on or even after it has been turned off. The outside of the unit gets so intensely hot that if you accidentally touch it anywhere on its outer surface, you get a nasty blistery burn. You cannot ever allow children in the kitchen when attempting to cook waffles with this skin sizzler. Also, the instructions tell you to spread out the batter, which I did. Even when using a small amount of batter, it came gushing out the sides! Then what stayed in stuck to the grid and had to be scraped out. I used Pam and it still stuck. I experimented with all different amounts of batter on all different settings and got the same horrendous results each time. This is the worst small appliance I have ever purchased and I am surprised it has not been recalled. Stay away from this one!
