There's no heat happening with this!
I was excited to add this handy little tool to my bugout bag. I had actually never tried using a magnesium fire starter. So when I got it home I wanted to try it out before stashing it away. I attempted to light a fire for over half an hour... I didn't get much spark and thought to myself "wow starting a fire is hard"! Only then did my boyfriend suggest I try his because he said it shouldn't be that hard. I tried his and started a fire within 10 seconds. I don't know if the metal in this product is not the right kind, or if it has some coating on it that prevents it from working, but do not buy this, waste of money.
