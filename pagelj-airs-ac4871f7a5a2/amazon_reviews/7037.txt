High Style on a Budget (Wedding)
I recently purchased this 'Silverware' for use at my wedding. It was a fairly elegent and intimate event for 120 guests, despite the budget. And for half the cost of what the caterer would have provided and twice the style, we decided to purchase our tableware ourselves. The use of Reflections Heavyweight Disposable Flatware got rave reviews. It was an evening event. So, the 'silverware' with some other high end disposables brought the elegant look I wanted on my dinner tables, without the high cost of rentals! I actually had several people ask about where to purchase some for holiday gatherings! The Reflections Flatware certainly helped save us money, while not compromising our sense of style. I would highly recommend not only the product for it's quality and overall look, but the use of it at any large scale event! Guests will be surprised it's disposable!!
