alright....
so i got this phone because i had lost my other and needed a cheap new one to use for a couple months.. i read the reviews and thought it wpuld be ok because it was temporary. I had recieved it earlier than expected so shipping was perfect! however, when i opened it i noticed it was so TINY !!!!!! my friends teased me all the time and made a joke out of it.. the phone would freeze ALOT and drop calls left to right. despite the flaws it is ok if it is temporary like me but if you want this for lomger than a year do not waste your money.. i would rather of saved my money and bought a smartphone than to have dealed with this for five months!!
