Great camera
My 12-year-old daughter purchased this camera for herself. I was so incredibily impressed with it, I bought one for myself. It has a lot of great features, for instance the "sketch" picture feature... really fun and different. I also love the zoom feature. I was hesitant to buy a "GE" camera but I am impressed with the quality.
