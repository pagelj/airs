I was positive that when I ordered this product it was NOT refurbished.  However, when I opened the box it clearly stated refurbished.  I gave this as a Christmas gift and within two weeks the product had broken and spilled water all over the recipient's counter.  It clearly states on the item that it MUST be returned within 90 days of the refurbished date which had long since passed when this product was used.  I certainly feel as if I had been cheated on so many levels.  Now I know why the price was so much cheaper than anywhere else.
