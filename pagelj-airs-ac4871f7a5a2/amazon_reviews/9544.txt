A Great Lens. Highly Recommend It
My wife has been mentioning for some time about how she does not like the way the photos of our kids turn out when she has to use the flash on our DSLR. This lens fixes that. With no need for the flash even on dim evening indoor shots the photos turn out beautiful. The lens also gives a great depth of field to the photos and make the subject really stand out.  It's a little expensive for casual users but it worth every penny!
