It's not even fair to label this appliance a toaster.  This miraculous invention makes an egg sandwich in three minutes:  toasts your muffin, poaches your egg, and even warms your ham and cheese... the whole bit.  Put down the breakfast bars and don't be afraid to hit the snooze because this thing will change your life!
