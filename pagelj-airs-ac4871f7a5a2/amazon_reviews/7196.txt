High Capacity, Low Price, Good Value, Slow w/ RAW Photos
I recently purchased a Canon Rebel T2i since I didn't need the relatively minor updates made in the T3i (at least not enough to justify the higher price).  I wanted to get a few SDHC cards to test for performance purposes, since the T2i strongly recommends a class 6 or higher for optimum performance.  Many have reported that less than class 6 will also slow down HD video recording, but that is specific to the T2i... If you understand SDHC card speeds and rating, skip ahead, otherwise, please read on...  SDHC classes are used to define minimum read and write speeds.  In my opinion, the write speed is much more important than the read speed since it allows your camera/video to process what you're doing and not slow down due to buffering or waiting for the card to write.  SDHC Class 10 is defined as achieving a minimum r/w of 10MB/s (according to wikipedia: [...].  There does not appear to be a higher class than 10, at least according to wiki.  A class 10 card is associated with a 66x rating.  So class 10 = 66x "speed". (I'm not a major techie, so please correct me if this is not accurate... I generally rely on wikipedia for this stuff). This card is rated as a class 10, 133x speed (speed is noted on the package, not the card itself).  For a card integrity and performance "simulation", I used H2testw with the Sandisk MicroMate SD / SDHC Memory Card Reader (Static Pack, New, SDDR-113) connected to a USB 2.0 port.  The following are my test results:Warning: Only 15378 of 15379 MByte tested. Test finished without errors. You can now delete the test files *. h2w or verify them again. Writing speed: 15.9 MByte/sReading speed: 17.1 MByte/sH2testw v1.4The warning message can be disregarded due to the FAT file structure and the program cannot test the portion of the SDHC card that has basic file structure data. Photo Testing:(1) Raw + Large Superfine (5184x3456): On continuous shooting mode it shot at maximum speed for about 3-5 photos and then slowed considerably, taking a photo every 0.75-1.00 seconds (again, using the T2i).(2) Raw only (5184x3456):  On continuous shooting mode it shot at maximum speed for 6 shots and then slowed down as noted in (1).(3) Large Superfine (5183x3456):  It does not slow down after taking 32 continuous photos, but note that if your goal is to get raw photos, this may not be your best option if you need multiple bursts. Video Testing:  Used HD 1920x1080 30fps and the video recorded for 2 minutes with no issues. Conclusion:  The card exceeds the minimums for a Class 10 designation.  However, it does not achieve the 133x (20MB/s) speeds that it claims.  For most people, this should not be an issue.  Check your device and do some research on the web to determine the appropriate memory card for your use. Overall, the 15.9MB/s vs. claimed 20Mb/s is not a deal breaker by any means to me, so I plan to keep the card and use it in this camera as a backup (using a 32GB card as a primary).  I'll update this review if there are any performance and/or product issues.
