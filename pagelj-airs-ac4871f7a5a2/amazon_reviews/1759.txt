So far so good
I might have bought more than I needed, and I know nothing about routers, etc, but this (my 3rd wireless router in 10 years) was very easy to set up and get going.  I set it up for both 5 and 2.4 ghz, but only my laptop picks up on the 5, our iphones don't.  I don't notice any difference when logged onto the 5 ghz wifi as far as speed, and (reading another reviewers tips) have it cranked up all the way.  I do notice that our devices now get full wifi bars all over our multi story house.  My iphone used to drop wi fi in the kitchen and switch to cell, now it keeps almost full wifi bars. The firmware upgrade was easy using the menu and a wired internet connection. Haven't tried streaming with the Blue Ray, etc, but don't know if we will see much difference as my cable modem service is low tier and is maxed out at 25 Mbps download.  Have had everything going for a few days now and have not had any dropped signals from the router. Next project is hooking up an external HD to the router....
