Great design with a few flaws
The thing fits firmly in the CD player and I don't worry about it falling out.  It holds the phone in place nicely.  However, the knob on the bottom used to tighten the "disc" into the CD player sticks out a little too far.  I have a button located directly beneath my CD player and it constantly makes contact with the mount. Also, the wings slide inwards to hold the phone.  It works great.  But, the release button is way in the back of the mount and can be a pain to get to. Overall, I would definitely recommend this mount as long as you don't have anything that it will get in the way of.
