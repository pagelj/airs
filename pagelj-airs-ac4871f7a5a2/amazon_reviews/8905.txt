I had one of these, scratch that, I had 3 of these... It was great, at first.  The hard boiled eggs boil over no matter how much water you use which is gross but it's easy and they cook really well.  The rest was so easy to work with. I got Soysauge and eggs and english muffins and had breakfast ready in a snap. The first one I got lasted 2 weeks, and then would no longer toast (that's the downfall, the toaster is not great) then we replaced, that one worked for 3 months and then the eggs would no longer cook which is even worse when expecting a hard boiled egg!! The third lasted about the same time. 3 months, I've given up on them. I hope somene has better luck, it's a great overall idea.
