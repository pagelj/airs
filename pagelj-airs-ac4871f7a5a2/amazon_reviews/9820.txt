I read all the reviews before purchasing the vacuum.  I was deciding between spending the full amount of a dyson, or giving this a shot.  We had a less expensive vacuum that had been purchased a few years back and did an ok job, or so we thought.  My husband was laughing as I ran around the house vacuuming EVERYTHING.  We have a little black lab who sheds everywhere, i could not believe/was disgusted, by how much it picked up and how much had been left behind.  Our dog was also terrified of our old vacuum, turning it on would send her running from the room and hiding under our bed.  The shark was so quiet, at first i didnt believe it was working, but i was able to vacuum right next to where she was sitting without her budging an inch. It is a great vacuum and well worth the price.
