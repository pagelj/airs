Very Nice But Not The Original
A very nice Made in China knock-off of the original 102S out of production Chicago Cutlery knife. A great little gift item or addition to your own kitchen. Not quite as sharp or as well-made as the original. Only very knowledgeable would be able to tell the difference as there is no country of origin on this knife or on the original. Made even better by 4 for 3 special offer.
