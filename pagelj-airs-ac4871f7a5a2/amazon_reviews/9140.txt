not usa friendly
I bought this phone and paid for one day shipping. Took a week to show up. took this phone to my wireless provider and was told it was not supported by their system and was told only ATT was compatible. went home and started searching on the net and most reviews I found said it was not very compatible with ATT so returned phone
