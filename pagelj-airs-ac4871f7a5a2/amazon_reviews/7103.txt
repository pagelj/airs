Perfect for what I need
I bought this bag as a replacement to the backpack I've been carrying to commute to work each day.  A lot of female consultants carry the Longchamp style bag and although I usually stay away from trends, I decided to give it a try.  The bag is of good quality (I've even received compliments that you can't tell it's a knock off).  Warning though - this bag is pretty big.  It serves my needs, since I carry a laptop, lunch bag, change of shoes, water bottle and few other items (that completely stuffs the bag, but still can easily zip closed). With all those items, the bag is heavier than I'd like, but what can you do?  Because it's basically one large compartment (has one zipper pocket), things tend to fall to the bottom and you're left rummaging around for awhile to get small things.  All in all, I'm very satisfied!
