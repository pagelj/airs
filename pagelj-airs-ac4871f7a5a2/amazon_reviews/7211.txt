Great New Features
This is my second set of Panasonic DECT 6.0 phones.  The "old ones" (5 years) were still working , but the battery life was beginning to decrease and some of the buttons were requiring more effort. There was a sale and so I went for it. WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.  First, the volume control is now a separate rocker button on the side of the handpiece. It is not a "soft-key" - the function is always the same and always available. This alone is worth the price, because my family includes people who are not menu-computer literate. The keypad is larger (same # of buttons), and the screen is larger with larger fonts and is better-lit than the last one. The other great feature is the improvement to the intercom.  Now, the phones are customizable with a name given for each handpiece.  So instead of having to remember which room handpiece  #4 is in, you just write "Kitchen" and you wont forget it.  It allows much broader usage of this helpful feature. The home screen of each hand piece shows the assigned name, so no matter how you mix them up (and they do get moved around), you can easily get the phones where they belong. I don't need the bluetooth feature, but it seems like a neat idea. As always, the voice quality and interference-free nature of DECT 6.0 is appreciated.
