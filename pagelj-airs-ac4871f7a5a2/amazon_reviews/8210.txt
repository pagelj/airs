Great all around or every day bag!
First off, the bag is very compact but when needed, it can expand greatly. I have been using this bag every day at school and in the field for 2 months or so and It has been awesome. The main compartment holds all of my folders but some binders might be to wide to fit. The secondary compartment holds my notebooks nicely. The bottom pocket on the front neatly organizes various items and the smallest pocket holds pens, flash drives, ect. Also, every pocket except the smallest one has another internal pocket. The pocket closest to your body houses a hydration bladder however I don't recommend using it. The shoulder straps are hard to understand but with some tinkering, they are quite comfortable. The fabric and stitching is made of 600 denier fabric which is very durable an the stitching itself is nice although there are a few loose ends that need to be cut. Nothing that compromises the quality though. Overall, this is a great bag for military, sports, school, and even EMTs who need something to fit between the seats of the ambulance. Definitely a good buy for the money.
