solid tips; completely non-technical
If you want a completely non-technical approach to shooting better (great?) shots in various common senarios (eg outdoors, weddings, flowers, sports, etc), this is exactly the right book for  you. It's a short read, but you'll have a hard time remembering all the valuable things that are in this book! One of the reviews mentions here mention how the author uses some weird humor in chapter intros, but don't let that distract you. The author admits he wrote most of those intros while smashed, and I believe it. If you want, just ignore the chapter infos. The tips are definitely very valuable. As the cover suggests, this is mainly for people with dslr's, so you're not going to get the most out of this book unless you already have one (or are planning to purchase a new one). Those with lesser cameras will still benefit from this book, but as this book makes clear, (digital) photography can be a very expensive hobby.
