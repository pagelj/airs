Great battery that still fits in your pocket (maybe)
I received the new updated model (with the micro USB input for charging).  No longer do you need to carry 2 separate cords, and the charging cord is readily available should you lose/forget it. When I first got it, I checked the user manual for the input amperage restrictions. I didn't see any specific restrictions so I connected it to my 2.1A port on my charger at night and left it overnight. When I woke up in the morning it was fully charged. I let my smartphone run nearly dead that night.  I then connected it to the New Trent IMP120D.  It charged in the usual time.  Then I connected my tablet at the same time.  Amazing to see a portable battery device that can charge both devices without skipping a beat. Unfortunately I rarely get my tablet get too low, so I was mostly doing "top offs" with this battery and my tablet. The ports are nice and solid and feel like they will last a long time. The case or shell has a spot that does not feel so solid, but I guess I will be careful not to ever press on that spot too hard. I like the use of the mini LED lights for power on indication and charge level, but I do not like how they bleed through the edges.  This makes it difficult to tell at night what level the battery is at.  Sometimes in the light it is difficult to tell as well. While I know they don't advertise it for keeping in your pocket, I do keep mine in my pocket.  It's barely noticeable, at least to me anyways.  This means I always have portable power on hand for my device or my family and friends' devices. All in all, I love this device.
