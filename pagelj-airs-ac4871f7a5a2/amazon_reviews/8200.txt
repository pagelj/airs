For a small vacuum cleaner, it really does it's job well for a smaller house or apartment. The suction works well especially for dog hair. I vacuum about every other day so the filter needs to be replaced more often then recommended. It vacuums well on the stairs. It is quite loud so you may not want to vacuum at night when most others are sleeping if you live in an apartment. It also blows out air which blows pretty hard, I don't understand the reasoning behind that. I know I am overdue in replacing my air filter b/c it's starting to blow out stinky air since I use it quite often... so I guess you can say part of the purpose of the air being blown while vacuuming becomes useful in this aspect. I would order another one if this one dies on me. For the price it's unbeatable. I forgot to register for the year warranty but I'm fine w/ it.
