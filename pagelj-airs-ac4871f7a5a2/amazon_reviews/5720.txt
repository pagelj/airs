I bought this 2  mths ago and loved it... gave it excellent ratings as it worked really well. Then it would not work... the battery charger  light worked so I figured it was the vacumm itself. Now it was too late to return. I emailed hoover . com. They gave a long complicated set of instructions to reprogram the battery which did not work. They said if it did not work contact them. I am still waiting for the call (i left a call back number after waiting a long time on the line) Not heard from them since. To return to amazon I will have to pay shipping and only get a partial refund. Now I still have no vacuum and don't know which to buy because this one is a dodo and I can't rely on it. Maybe the sharp. or a hoover corded??? Update.... so Hoover called and after talking it over with a very pleasant lady we discovered that the problem was that a screw missing from the handle ! The screw tightens the handle to the base so that the contact between the baterry and on/off switch is secure. she will mail me one... meantime,pressing down on handle got it started !.... so yeah.. get one !
