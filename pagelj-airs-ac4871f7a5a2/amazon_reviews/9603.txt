Too slow and feels cheap
It's a cheap digital camera that feels like it's made of cheap plastic and is very slow to respond. You have to wait at least a full second between taking pictures, which is not good when you are trying to get any kind of action shot, even with the supposed action mode. I would spend the extra money and get a camera that is capable of recording 1080p video as well, and that isn't made entirely of plastic.
