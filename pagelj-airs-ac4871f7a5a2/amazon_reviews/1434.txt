Great player for the price!
I remember when these first came out (yeah, I am old! ha ha!) and you were lucky if you could get one under a few hundred bucks. Well times have certainly changed!!! This works VERY well, and is perfect for children in the car. We do have a van with a tv, but my sedan has nothing. And traveling with twins (even though they aren't very little anymore) can still result in arguments, touching, etc. I am sure many of you can relate! This is a perfect anecdote to car boredom!  And for the price, they both could have one! We are sharing right now, but if somehow in the future that seems to fail, we will get another one!!
