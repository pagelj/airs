Worst Toaster
I purchased Cuisinart CPT-170 Toaster because it was highly rated. Toaster burns one side of bread each time and is consistent in both slots. Big Dissappointment! and a waste of money! I DO NOT HAVE ORIGINAL PACKAGING SO CANNOT RETURN IT. SO I AM STUCK WITH A DEFECTIVE TOASTER! Don't buy this.
