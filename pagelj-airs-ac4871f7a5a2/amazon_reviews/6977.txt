Must have if repairing a phone screen.
I bought this to use when replacing the screen on my EVO 4G. It works perfectly and I would go as far as to say that you really need this to do it properly. This is a huge amount of tape though and I can't see myself using it all by any means, but at this price it was well worth it. You could seriously fix 50 phone screens and still have tape to spare.
