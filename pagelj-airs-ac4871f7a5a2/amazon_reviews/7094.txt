Outstanding Backpack
Excellent quality of construction is immediately apparent on this pack. It's tough, lightweight, very comfortable. Bought it to be used as an everyday city pack as well as a hiking and/or short-term camping pack. I'm very happy with the choice. This is my first Kelty pack, and I will likely buy others in the future. It also doesn't hurt that the pack looks great. Got it in the cypress color. Attractive stuff.
