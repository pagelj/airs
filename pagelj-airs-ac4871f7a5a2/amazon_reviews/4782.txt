Great Value
For the price, these can't be beat.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, but I figured I'd give it a try before I spent money on one of the more expensive Screen Protectors.  But, the Tech Armor protectors are quite good, and having 3 of them for $6 is too good to pass up. Reading some of the other reviews, it sounded like installing the screen protector was going to be a big ordeal.  But following the provided directions and watching the video that Tech Armor links to when you buy their product, installation wasn't difficult at all.  The air bubbles were easy to squeegee out.  The several tiny pieces of dust that was trapped between the screen and the protector took more effort, but using the supplied tape and again following Tech Armor's instructions, it only took 4 or 5 minutes, at most. The final result is a screen protector which, if it were not for the outline around the "home" button and ear speaker, I wouldn't even be able to tell it was on the phone.  I would definitely recommend this to others, if for no other reason that to give it a try before spending 2x-4x as much on one of the competitors.
