High Quality Bag
This bag arrived in great condition, wrapped in paper and plastic with a covered zipper and front tab.  The nylon is a bright red and appears as though it will hold up very well with heavy use.  The interior has a busy pattern; it is cream with the brand name listed repeatedly.  This doesn't matter too much because the top closes with a zipper and it should be hard for others to see.  Overall, good day bag at a good price.
