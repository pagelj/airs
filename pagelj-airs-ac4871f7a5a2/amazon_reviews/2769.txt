So far, so good.
It is spectacular, it is taking great photos. I have hardly put it down since it came in the mail! I have already done one photoshoot with it! It is my next step and transition to bigger cameras and I am super excited to keep using it daily. It is magnificent and spectacular. And I would recommend it to anyone!
