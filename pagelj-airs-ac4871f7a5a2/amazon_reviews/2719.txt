First impressions.
Overall impression is very positive. Pictures seem to be very colorful and sharp. Have not checked them on bigger screen yet, though. Zoom is good, although focusing at the max zoom is slow/unreliable. Some minor details that felt wrong are the position of the flash (I'm used to holding the camera with my left hand and the flash tries to pop up from underneath of my left index finger now), a little too long of a delay between pressing the video record button and actually starting/stopping video recording, and a little too long time between shots (I guess saving those 16 MPixel pics takes too long).
