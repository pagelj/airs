A fascinating and foreshadowing tale of the future.
Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is an interesting tale of a strange and ominous future which is hauntingly convincing.  It is the story of a man named Guy Montag, who's job it is to burn books.  He loves his job until he  meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan.  When she disappears Montag begins  to further question his job and his world.  I thoroughly enjoyed this  book.  The story was quite fascinating and I could often relate to the  characters.  I also liked Bradbury's descriptions of various objects in the  book.  However, the most amazing thing about the book was that the strange  and twisted world it describes did not seem that far off.  This is  especially remarkable as the book was written forty six years ago.  Bradbury was able to predict many things that would happen, for example the  increasing picture quality and use of the Television.  I would  recommend this book to people who like science-fiction or futuristic books.  I would not recommend it to people who prefer more traditional books.  I  would also not recommend it who will get annoyed by an eccentric writing  style or find it hard to understand as even I did a few times.
