Unbelieveable!
I've had mine about 4 months now and I have to say that I use it every single day.  I have baked cookies, pizzas, chicken breasts, toasted English muffins and pine nuts, and even roasted garlic.  I was hesitant to give up counter space to any variety of "toaster oven".  I've had a couple over the years.  But, THIS is no ordinary toaster oven!  This is a life-saver and an indispensable kitchen appliance.  The convection feature is wonderful.  It comes with a baking sheet, the shelf is adjustable, and the controls are so easy to use.  It's built very well, is very sturdy and does not feel thin or rickety.  On top of all that, it's a lovely looking appliance.  If you are looking for a counter-top oven, you will not regret this purchase.  Trust me; just get it!  This is totally the Mercedes Benz of toaster ovens!
