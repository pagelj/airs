Plays DVDs that other players cannot
There is one reason and one reason only why I bought this DVD player: My wife and I check out a lot of DVDs from the library and need a player that won't constantly skip when we try to watch them. I've owned several different brands of DVD player in the past and found that different brands have different strengths and weaknesses. The xbox is dirt cheap but won't play some dvds and has zero image smoothing of artifacts. Pioneer players will play pretty much everything and are rock-solid reliable but don't handle artifact particularly well either. My Xbox 360's HD-DVD drive smoothes and up-scales and pretty much completely eliminates digital noise on a decent DVD, but even that occasionally has trouble reading beat-up discs. No so with this DVD player. Some people are apparently complaining about the lack of an eject button on a remote (which is kind of ridiculous because you have to get up to take the disc out anyway) but it doesn't bother me at all. This player isn't particularly good at cleaning digital noise and artifacting, but the picture is far from bad on my standard-def CRT in my bedroom. The only real downside I see is that it takes a while to load and eject. If you need a player for a standard-def set that will play anything I'd recommend this one highly. If you are running a high-def home theater you are probably running blu-ray anyway and thus have no need for something like this... unless your fancy new blu-ray player won't play scratched DVDs....
