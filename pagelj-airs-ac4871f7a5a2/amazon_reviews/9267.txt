I bought this coffee maker (DCC-1200) in 2003, and it has served me well for almost 7 years.  About 3 or 4 months ago it began exhibiting the symptoms that many other owners of this model eventually see: first it would just randomly shut off.  Then the clock would reset itself from time to time and the timer would not work.  Then finally this AM after brewing what would be it's last pot, we smelled that telltale burning circuitry smell.  It had shut down, and would not come back on! :(  But hey, who can complain about 7 years of service?!  My father-in-law buys another brand that rhymes with "Sister Toffee", and he burns through one about every 1-2 years. So I ordered another one today from Amazon, but in the cool new matte black finish.  It will match our other kitchen appliances and not show smudges like the stainless one we had before.  I kept the basket and carafe from the old one as spares.  Hopefully I'll get the same lifespan out of this one. Don't hesitate to buy this model!  Brews great coffee, has an adjustable plate temp, so it's drinkable from the first pour and won't scald the coffee toward the end of the pot.  Charcoal filter makes it taste great!  I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, so the 1-4 cup setting is very useful.  It bumps up the brewing temp for small pots, so you still get full flavor even though it's not steeping as long.
