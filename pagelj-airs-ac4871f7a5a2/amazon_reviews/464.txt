I love the Kindle Fire HD!
I can't really say anything new that hasn't already been said about the Kindle Fire HD.  This is a great little gadget.  I am not a gadget-guru type, so I am just going to say what I like about this device:1.  The screen looks great for playing games and watching movies in HD.2.  The sound is amazing... I listen to my iPod music, radio apps, etc at work and at home.  I love the sound quality.3.  I am reading even more books now because I am inspired by the device and the selection on Amazon has everything.4.  I have surfed the web on it a few times and have been impressed with the experience.  I usually just surf on my home computer though.  I will enjoy having this device to surf the web (if I want to) when traveling.5.  I really love that there is lots of free content on Amazon. There's so much more I could say... but I don't want to be ANOTHER one of those reviewers who write novel-style reviews. All I can say is that I am very happy I purchased this device and I really enjoy using it.  Money well spent!
