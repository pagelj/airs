TEXTING SUCKS SUCKS and SUCKS.  (AND INTERNET TOO.)
I'm going to just mention the texting.  It's a real deal killer at this point in the tech evolution. Three HUGE negatives: 1) there is no subject threading - sent and received are separate. Can't connect response to question! I know - mind-blowing.  2) there is no way to archive or save to the 4 Gig you installed - really - this completely blew my mind.  (There actually is a way using a SIM CARD EDITOR (TIP TIP TIP) but I haven't done it yet) WAIT - I'M NOT DONE:  3) the screen touch-sensitivity and wandering makes it almost impossible to use fingers for texting.  It seriously takes MINUTES where normal slider or capacitive screen takes seconds. GET A STICK (anything works).  BUT OH WAIT - (BONUS BONUS) - THERE'S ONE MORE BIG SUCK: IT MAXES OUT AT 500 MESSAGES TOTAL - and then it summarily DUMPS YOUR NEXT MESSAGE. Okay? And it takes about 30 seconds to preview and delete a message. IF IT LETS YOU SELECT IT AT ALL. OUCH I SERIOUSLY WANT A NEW PHONE. OKAY - I have to at least mention the internet - NOTHING WORKS except what TRACFONE PROVIDES, for me it's the weather - once in a while headline news.  THAT'S IT - don't even think about normal web surfing - ain't gonna happen. VERY FRUSTRATING. GOOD SIDE: it's small enough to use one-handed anytime - say while riding a bike with the other hand - and I'm not even going to worry if I drop it!  (Duh.)AND . . . it actually takes decent pix with a wide-angle glued in a hole in the case (TIP TIP TIP) - AND - the audio is pretty good when recording to sucky (but small - great for comparison shopping) video. THANKS FOR YOUR REVIEWS.
