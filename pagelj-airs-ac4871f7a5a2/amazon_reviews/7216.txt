Toasters are usually an expendable item at our household.  No matter what brand or how fancy, I find that a toaster only lasts around two years.  That's why I don't like to spend much money for a toaster.  I recently bought an inexpensive Black & Decker toaster, but the slots weren't quite long/wide enough for some pieces of artisan breads.  So in looking for a toaster with long/wide slots, I came across this relatively inexpensive T-Fal model.  As soon as I took it out of the package I could feel how solid and well built this unit is.  After a couple of weeks, it toasts evenly and consistently, a great performer.  The countdown indicator is a nice feature, tells you how much longer you have to wait for your toast to pop.  It even beeps when it is ready to pop.  You can't beat this unit that cost a little over $30.  I highly recommend this toaster.
