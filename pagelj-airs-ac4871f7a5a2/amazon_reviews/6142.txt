Not for Galaxy Tab 2 7.0
I purchased this in hopes of using it with my Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7.0, but it will not work. I hoped I could use a female-to-female USB adapter, along with the Galaxy Tab's data transfer cable, to make it work, but sadly, it does not. For holding the tablet, it just barely fits in the holders, and it does not seem very secure. It looks like it would not have much trouble sliding out the sides, as it is only 3 prongs gripping the table, 2 on the top and 1 on the bottom. The clip is magnetic, so I did worry a bit about the effect that prolonged exposure might have to the tablet. The keyboard itself has a decent feel to it, being plastic rather than silicon, and it is very portable. I was considering returning it, but I think I will use it for my servers instead.
