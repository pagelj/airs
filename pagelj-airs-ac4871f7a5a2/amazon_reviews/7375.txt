Could not put it down...
I really liked this book. Well-defined characters. Fascinating aliens. Cool twists. A little Ender's Game-ish. To be honest, I couldn't put this down once I started reading. It really kept a great pace that had me wanting more. Very impressed that this was self-published. I'm hoping Zero Recall is just as enthralling. Well done, Sara!
