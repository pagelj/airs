Good product but defective
I purchased this phone for my mother as a Christmas gift.  The numbers are large and back light is bright, so I have no doubt this will work for her.  But when calling out we noticed that the caller was unable to hear her, thus I had to return the phone.  I have ordered another, hopefully this one will work better. She and I both like the phone, just thought the one we purchased was defective.  I would purchase a replacement and still recommend it to others.
