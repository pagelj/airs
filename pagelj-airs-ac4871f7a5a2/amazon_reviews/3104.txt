I thought we found the perfect vacuum cleaner but about 1 minute into the first use the vacuum started making a horrible grinding sound. It sounded like we vacuumed up one of the kids toy's. After looking at the brushes and checking all of the filters nothing was found. Testing it on the hardwood floor it seemed fine, but every time we tried it on our medium length carpet it would make a grinding noise. It seems to have good power and seemed to be picking up a lot of dirt and pet hair but it just does not work on carpet. Comments on the Dyson website recommended turning the brush off when vacuuming carpet. We tried that and the vacuum did not pick up any dirt. I would be very leery about buying this vacuum if you have any carpet. If you do try it be ready for a big disappointment and make sure the store that you purchase it has a good return policy.
