This was a top rated vacuum on consumer reports, which is why I bought it initially. So glad I did. Stair tool is very easy to use and the whole vacuum is very lightweight. It is pretty low maintenance as well with very powerful suction. I love that it can clean both my carpets and my hardwood floors.
