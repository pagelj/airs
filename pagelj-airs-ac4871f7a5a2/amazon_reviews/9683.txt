Overall great
II'm a junior in high school, and take a lot of AP classes, so this bag is going through a lot of wear. I've had it for at least a month now, and despite carrying multiple textbooks, binders, and the occasional laptop, it's only showing a couple signs of it. The end of some of the fabric frayed, but a lighter fixed that. And the fabric is coming out from under the ring. It's still much roomier than any other sling I've used.
