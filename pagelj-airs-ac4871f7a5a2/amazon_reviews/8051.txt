Highly recommended
This is the first time I actually reviewed a book because I really want this author to gain the deserved recognition and I hope she will continue to write books of this calibre.  I will definitely buy her future books.  I am so glad this book was amongst the list of books recommended by Amazon based on some of the other books I recently purchased.  This story made me get teary eyed, my heart raced, laughed out loud, and felt the highs and lows with Allison and Cedric.  Well done!
