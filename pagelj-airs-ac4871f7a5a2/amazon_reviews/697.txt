Probably the best laptop for the money
Definitely the best computer I've owned so far. Definitely was worth every penny. Design: 4/5Very sleek, nice design for the most part. Keyboard feels nice to type on. USB connectors secure in drives and cables. Mouse pad is definitely not the greatest, sometimes multitouch interferes with usage. However, swipe to change programs is a nice touch. Specs: 5/5For the price, I doubt you will find better laptop specs. 1.9 gHz AMD A8 Quad core, Radeon 7640M Graphics, 4gBs RAM, and 500gB hard drive. RAM and hard drive could use upgrades, however you will definitely be able to run most games you throw at this laptop at playable speeds. Sound: 3/5Probably the biggest failing point of this laptop is the sound system. Speakers are located on the bottom of the laptop, and are very tinny. Use headphones for best sound quality, and use the "Dance" preset for best sound quality from the built in speakers. Graphics: 4/5All games I've played on this will run just fine. Graphically intensive games usually run between 20-40FPS. Software: 3/5Windows 8 Metro is an absolute mess to navigate without a touch screen. Either install Windows 7 or ClassicShell for best usage (I recommend ClassicShell unless you really know what your doing in reinstalling OSs).
