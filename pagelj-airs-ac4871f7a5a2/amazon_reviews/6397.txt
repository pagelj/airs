I bought this machine about 6-8 months ago and it works fine except the coffee is not hot enough,at least not for my taste. I like a steaming hot cup that I can sip and enjoy. This thing, I can swallow the brew in one big gulp. Because the brew is luke warm the coffee isn't broken down properly and it doesn't taste good. So after getting tired of poor tasting luke warm brew I bought a KRUPS thinking cheap you buy,cheap you get. WRONG!!!! I've got the same exact problem. You can't tell the difference between the two. I've even tried a different outlet to brew the coffee,same thing. So now after brewing I heat the coffee a little more on the stove,it's crazy!  Does anyone else feel this way,is it me,is there something wrong? Is this true of most automatic drip coffee makers? When I by a cup of coffee out it is much hotter. I don't get it.  Please Comment.
