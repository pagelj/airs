This makes the best coffee ever!  We use the strong setting and the coffee is delicious.  But the carafe always seems to drip from the tip when pouring so you need to pour over the sink.  And the inside of the lid and the area around the coffee well get so wet that they do not try overnight, even if you leave lid open to the air.  We wipe these areas off with a paper towel after using.  However, these are a small price to pay for great coffee!
