lifetime warranty
I bought a set of Cuisinart knives in 2007.  Recently they developed large cracks in the handles.  I contacted Cuisinart by email and was directed to another company who manufacturers the knives for Cuisinart.  After a couple of emails back and forth, I was directed to a website and allowed to pick a similar set for replacement. (The set I purchased was no longer available.)  In just a couple of days I received the replacement set.  Can't complain about the warranty service!
