7" Survival Push Knife
I'm giving this knife 3 stars.  I would have given it 4 but the sheath is very cheap.  When I took the knife out of the box the tip of the knife was already sticking through the end of the sheath.  The knife is what one expects from a $10 knife and maybe a little more.  Nice heavy steal that will take abuse and at $10 you won't mind doing to this knife what you would not do to a nice $100 knife.  The fire starter works great.  This knife will make a good toss it in with the camp gear and forget it knife.  A few swipes on a stone the the edge is good to go.  Am going to rewrap the cord on the handle, the job they did in China is not up to my standards.  Lots of good videos on youtube on how to do this.  I might grind a small notch for the cord to set in to make it a little more secure.
