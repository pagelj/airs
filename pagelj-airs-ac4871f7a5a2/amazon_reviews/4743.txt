Good option for TV and movie streaming
I have been without a cable subscription for 2 years now, and I just bought this Roku player to avoid hooking up my laptop. It was very easy to set up, and the interface is good.  I like the HuluPlus interface better than my blu-ray player one. The Amazon Prime works well, too.  I started finding some private channels also to see how many options there are. I wish there were more cable-type channels like MSNBC, Here TV and ESPN, but they are all contracted with cable companies right now. I hily recommend this simple player.
