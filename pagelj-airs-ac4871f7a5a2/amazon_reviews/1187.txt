Exactly what I was looking for!!!
This tablet is exactly everything I wanted from an android tablet.  It runs and acts just like any android smartphone minus the phone number.  With google talk I can video chat, voice chat, or just text chat all through my gmail account.  Same access to google play store with all the same free apps from my phone.  Unlike the iphone/ipad where most of the same apps cost you money.  This tablet also lets you completely customize it to your liking unlike most iproducts.  Small enough to easily carry around with you but definitely big enough to do everything you need easier than on your smartphone.  I haven't had any issues with lagging, it is fast and reliable.  Runs great, screen is great, sound is great.  I seriously have yet to find a flaw with this tablet at all.  Granted, I'm not a high end techie either, but enough to know that this is definitely worth the price and a great product. I also bought this accessory bundle  at the same time,CrazyOnDigital Purple Stand Leather Case with Charger and Screen Protector For Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 (6-item).  Screen protector is wonderful, I prefer using it than to the actual screen itself, seems my finger glides over it easier.  The case is great as well, plus the extra chargers are nice to have, especially the car charger.  I definitely would recommend buying the two together, that way you have all the accessories you need.  I really can't think of anything else to say except if you are debating over which tablet to get, stop and just get this one, you won't regret it!
