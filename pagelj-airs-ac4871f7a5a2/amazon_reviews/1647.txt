Not how portrayed
I bought this for my husband because he wanted to be able to look at his Kindle Fire hands free and wanted a protective cover.  Well, when it got here, I was so disappointed. It does protect his Kindle Fire, but it is so stiff that it is useless when it comes to sitting up the Kindle Fire.  There are strips of cloth type material that is supposed to hold the Kindle in place, but they don't.  There needs to be slotted areas to sit the Kindle into.  He is still holding his Kindle (which was the main reason I bought this item) because no matter how he has tried, the cover does not loosen up and the cloth material is worthless.
