Fine Camera, but Canon 300 HS is much better for video
I was looking for a camera to replace my Canon SD780 IS, which was a nearly perfect travel and main video camera until the day it stopped focusing.  Based on the reviews it looked like the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS would be the perfect replacement. The body of the 100 HS is plastic, which made it feel inferior to the SD780, but the pictures it took looked great.  To me the real shortcoming was with its video. In HD it can only shoot at 24fps and quick movements produced a trippy distortion (not sure if it was a lens issue or an fps issue) that did not look as natural as my old SD780, which shot HD at 30fps. I've since bought a 300 HS for about $50 more and could not be happier with it, as it has a metal body, can shoot HD video at 30fps, can focus/ optically zoom during a video shoot and does not have the same distortion issue when shooting HD video as the 100 HS has.
