Great little addition to your entertainment system
Tiny little gadget adds a lot more entertainment options than all the other bigger boxes lining our entertainment center. I have access to Netflix (although what's available is a lot less than what they have on DVD but this isn't a review on Netflix), Amazon (VERY limited and OLD content for now - hope they'll add more content that's generated more than 6 figures at the box office this decade), Hulu, HBOgo, a full version of Angry Bird, etc. The remote is a little finicky (which makes the inevitable Angry Bird obsession more frustrating) and the UI could use improvement but definitely worth supplementing your existing cable service. The set up was stupid-easy but our unit kept losing the wifi signal until we reset our wireless modem. Not sure why that fixed it but it did...
