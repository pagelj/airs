Fantastic except for one feature
Overall I am satisfied with the Nikon Coolpix P510. My last two cameras were Canons so this was a jump for me. The quality of the photos is stellar. One reason I bought the camera was the zoom lens because I enjoy photographing birds and animals that frequent our woods. Quite often I am shooting through a window.  Even so, the detail on these photographs is simply phenomenal.  On the birds you can see tiny individual feathers with clarity.  There are details I have never been able to capture on previous cameras. The feature that annoys me is that the self-timer only takes one shot and then reverts back to regular mode. I can't think of a single instance when using a self-timer that I have only taken one shot. When you have a group of people, as we did at Christmas, re-setting the self timer after every group shot was a major nuisance. I have investigated the menus on the Nikon and cannot find an option to change this. On my previous cameras it would stay in the self timing mode until it turned off or you changed it back. If anyone knows of a way to reset this feature I would appreciate learning about it.
