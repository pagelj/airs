brain-dead flash, and no lens protection
The flash in this camera seems to fire at full power every time, leading to terribly overexposed subjects.  When I first saw this, I thought "hm, must have missed a setting somewhere", so I dug through all the menus but to no avail.  Next, I searched Nikon's web site for updated firmware to fix this egregious problem, but no updates were available.  Thus the camera is useless for most indoor shots.  On the plus side, outdoor shots are beautiful when there's plenty of sunlightAnother problem with this camera is the absence of any protection for the lens.  The lens is somewhat recessed from the protective frame around it, but there is nothing to cover it.  I lent the camera to my 10-year-old to use for a day and it came back with a scratch that could not be fixed. The positives (GPS, quick focus, good 1080P video, water and dust proof) are outweighed by the negatives, and I can't recommend this camera.
