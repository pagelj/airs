This laundry machine is great. I have had it for almost a year now, it does a great job. No problems at all, and it washes the clothes much better than the "professional" type machines in the near-by laundromat. Do not be deceived by its small size, it is very powerful. Great purchase, I would recommend it to anyone who does not have enough space for a regular-size laundry machine!
