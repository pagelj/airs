It's a Sonic Screwdriver, need I say anything more?!
The tenth doctor is my favorite, so even though the new 11th screwdriver is out, I elected to buy this version.  It's brilliant.  The end lights up classic blue.  It extends, and it makes the noise!  I now have my own sonic screwdriver, and I use it all the time, sonic-ing along with the episodes. Now, for a serious review, I am a little disappointed with the design.  The extending part is flimsy.  You can't do it as easy as tennent does it in the show.  Although, it does also make the noise when it is extended, which is a nice feature.  And the sound is good, though it is definitely a higher pitch than in the show, which was disappointing.  Also it makes two sounds, and I'm not sure why.  The second has this weird screechy noise that is unpleasant.  I don't recognize it from the show, although it could just be a bad version of it.  I don't know, but I end up pushing the button twice before I get the right sound whenever I sonic it.  And third, the little part that is covering a screw is also the sliding button to extend the end.  It falls off all the time, which adds to the flimsiness of it.  And fourth (I know a lot of negatives for a DW item), the pen nib does not stay on well.  When I hold the screwdriver, the pen nib is in the part of my grip that makes it fall off.  It's annoying!  And just a sidenote, it is too big to be a pen.  I thought I might actually use it as one, but it is just under an inch thick, so too big for that.  And the pen nib falls off in my grip when I try to hold it as a pen, too. Alright, overall it's a sonic screwdriver.  It's awesome.  I love it.  It is about $20 online, and it is accordingly flimsy.  I think I had $100 hopes and I couldn't help but be disappointed.  If you care about quality, and want to search for a better one, you'll probably pay more for it.  If it's worth it or not, I don't know.  For something I only use when I'm watching Doctor Who, it is awesome to have.
