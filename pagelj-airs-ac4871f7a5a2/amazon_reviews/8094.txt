I purchased two; one for our main house and the other for our vacation rental. I own a Miele fior the heavy duty cleaning but this little vac is wonderful for quick pick ups. Works great on my area rugs and jute rugs. Love that it's cordless. I also purchase extra filters and the extra battery pack. I rinse out the filter and always have a back up filter and battery pack. Love it!
