Does not have the OEM Coating!
My screen works fine after this replacement but it doesn't have the protective fingerprint coating. It doesn't have that super smooth feel that the OEM 3GS screen does and shows fingerprints very easily. The screwdriver that comes with this is too big. It can be used but you will damage your screws. Update: About a week later the adhesive isn't sticking to the glass! I have to keep pushing the screen back down.
