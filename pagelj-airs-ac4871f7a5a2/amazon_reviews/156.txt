Magical Journey
I have never read anything from this author so I did not know what to expect. I like fantasy but this was so much more than that. I just love this story. It is told through the eyes of a seven year old boy as his grown up self is reminiscing. He is a shy, bookish, lonely type kid that many of us can relate to. The story is new and familiar at the same time. Without revealing too much of the plot, ultimately it is about every child's fears, the wonder, struggle and pain of growing up. Its about the childhood memories that "blur and smudge" with time and shape the rest of our lives. These themes are woven into a realistic fantasy and I just love it. This is a very refreshing read. The will be the easiest few hours you ever spend, and when you are done you are ready to dive in all over again!
