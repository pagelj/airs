Cute Bag
I got this bag for Christmas.  Overall it's pretty nice.  The bag is a plastic / vinal material.  The circles are a velvet-ish material.  The bag is made in Asia somewhere, the tag was all Asian characters.  The bag had a very strong plastic smell to it, after a few days it still has a slight smell but it's not to bad.  If you are chemically senstitive you would want to leave it outside to air out for a week or two.  There isn't a ton of room inside.  It has a divider in the middle with a zipper. On one side you have two pockets, I use them for my cell phone and chapstick.  The other side has a small zipper pocket.  The interior fabrick is kind of cheap fealing.  The quality is what I would expect for the price though.
