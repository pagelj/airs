I bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee stainless carafe coffee maker.  I am so pleased with it!  The coffee is very hot, and the lid is easy to operate.  Don't let other reviews deter you.  The inside of the carafe is stainless steel, as well, which I like.  The Mr. Coffee carafe had some black coating inside that started coming off (in my coffee?!).
