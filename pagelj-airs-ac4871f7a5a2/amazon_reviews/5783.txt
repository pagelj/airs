Case for netbook
The product seems to be made with cheap materials, I dont expect it to last long. It is padded just on one side, not both, so you laptop will be "protected" just on one side. Anyway, if you want a case for your netbook for storage, this will do fine, but for heavy use, I wont recommend this one.
