Good for single shots.
Only used this card 1 time. It worked well on single shot photos. However it had trouble keeping up with my Canon Rebel T4i when shooting continuous 5 images per second. About every 6 or 8 shots the camera would have to hesitate about a second for the card to catch up.(at the race track) Have not tried video yet. The price and service was good at Amazon.
