Very Happy
Our travel computer does not have an internal DVD/CD drive, so if I wanted to load anything on it, I had to use another computer to copy from the DVD/CD to a flash drive, and then load.  This drive was inexpensive, eliminates the flash drive, and does everything that I need.  Since I run Windows XP, I didn't even have to load a driver for the new drive.
