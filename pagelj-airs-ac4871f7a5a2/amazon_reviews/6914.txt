Great!
Sound projection is GREAT! I can hear everything clearly WITHOUT hurting my ears with loudness like my old headphones. They always stay in my ears, and I don't have to keep putting them back in. They are also very comfortable, and are labeled with R and L for the ears. I recommend buying these headphones INSTEAD of the crappy ones that come with your ipod. You will not regret buying these headphones.
