bad phone case
It fits the phone well, but the case is very difficult to come off. I had to take it off with a key because it wouldn't come off easy unless you brake it. Also the "rubber" peeled off the second day which just results in plastic, and the phone charger won't fit unless you take the case off. I guess you get what you pay for.
