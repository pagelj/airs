Excellent Case, well worth buying
My husband bought this case with the kindle for my Christmas present two years ago. My kindle (version 1) died last week, but this case has been wonderful. Two years later, after heavy daily use for everything from reading a reference book while programming (sitting open on my desk) to recipes in the kitchen (open on the counter top) to late night reading in bed (completely folded back), even being stuffed in a bag or the door of the car, carried across country and abused by my teenager when she flies home to visit family, the only wear it has shown is a little rubbing on the velvet where my hand rested to hold it in bed at night and a slight bit of stretching in the thick strap i slid over my hand. Straps and corner clips are still in excellent condition, the leather and hinge are in beautiful condition, and I haven't had any issues with it. It feels great in the hand and does an excellent job of protecting the kindle (not a scratch on mine in 2 years!) Very good case, well worth the money.
