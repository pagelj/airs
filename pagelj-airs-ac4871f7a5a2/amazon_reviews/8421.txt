LG Optimus Elite Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)
Over all I like the phone, no problem with the battery and pretty easy to use. The two problems I have had with the phone is that when I was setting up my e-mail I clicked on e-mail on the main screen not realizing that there was another screen that had an app for g-mail. This created a security problem with my e-mail provider when I tried to correct the problem. The other problem is that when you turn on your phone , you get this annoying music as it turns on.
