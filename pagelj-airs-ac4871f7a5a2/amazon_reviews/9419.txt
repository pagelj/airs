loopholes?  more like "get your brain to work"
Plenty of people have said how good this book is, so I'm not going to go on and on.  Instead, I will oly say that the so called "loopholes"  of this story are so stratigically placed to force the reader to thnk.  Example:  where is Clarisse?  what trully happened to her?  a loophole? perhaps.  Or maybe, a weapon of Ray Bradbury to manipulate the reader into thinking, and not becoming Mildred.
