I did not realize how challenging it is to buy a toaster these days.  Our last one was 15 years old, but one morning, decided to burn itself and the cabinets above it, up flames.  Purchased and returned 5 toasters before getting this one. None of them toasted evenly.  This one does what it is suppose to do and it looks as good on the counter as it does in the pictures.
