It's good for the price.
I'm getting into photography as a hobby and this camera has full manual control so that you can set the aperture (f/3.4 - f/8.0), shutter speed (15" - 1/2500") and ISO (80 - 1600) separately for total exposure control. Photograph quality is reasonable, not great. Outdoor shots are the easiest because of the good lighting. Low light conditions are a bit challenging, but I was able to manipulate manipulate the settings to get pretty decent indoor shots without using the flash. As regards the battery life I had on hand some heavily used NiMh rechargeable batteries and some new eneloops. Here's a comparison of the total amount of shots (without flash) I was able to take before the camera shut down because of the low battery warning:Radio Shack HR6 (6 years old): 20 shotsPanasonic 1950 (9 years old): 48 shotsSanyo Eneloops (new): 96 shotsBased on those results I estimate about 3 pairs of good quality NiMh batteries should be more than sufficient to take care of my shooting stints at any one time. Honestly the camera has everything that I need at this stage and for the 100 bucks I paid, I'm more than happy.
