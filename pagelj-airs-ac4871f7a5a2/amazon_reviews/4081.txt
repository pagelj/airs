It was a fantastic toaster while it worked.  Bagel mode is awesome.  But within a year, the burners in each side would only get hot on one side of the slice.  The other side of the slice would just get a tiny bit warm but nothing hot enough to burn a slice of bread.  I like bagels but I like toast too.  So, now, if I want to make toast, I have to toast it on one side and then flip all the pieces over and toast the other side. Breville's response to my request for repair was "you're out of warranty... sorry". I loved the toaster while it worked.  But I'm extremely disappointed in its longevity... especially at this price point.
