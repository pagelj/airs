I have been using this set since December 2012.  I waited a while before writing my reveiw to see how things worked.  I am very happy.  I did luck out and got this on Black Friday for a sweet price which made this all the nicer but truthfully knowing what I know now I would pay full price.  I use both pieces all the time.  I have three dogs - two of which that shed a great deal.  These pieces handle the job terrific.  I have gone through my share of vacuum cleaners.  I have bought high end cleaners that would die within 2 years.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that this Hoover stays the course.  i will update if this disappoints but so far no signs of failure.  The suction is terrific and this is lightweight yet feels like a quality product not cheap.  I use the attachment canister for my hardwood floors and upholstery - it does a decent job.  I just prefer an upright vacuum for my everyday vacuum and this Hoover fits the bill.  Just remember to change the bags - this keeps the suction optimum and Amazon has some great deals on bags too.
