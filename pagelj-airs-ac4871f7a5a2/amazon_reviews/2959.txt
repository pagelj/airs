Bought two to use with new Nikon 5100/ One died the first time used
Purchased two of these cards while trying to equip a new camera purchase.  One is working fine; however, the other was not recognizable by the camera after the first use and downloading of pictures to my computer.  Since this one was not used for the first two months I owned it, it is now apparently not returnable to Amazon?  Most of my many previous purchases have proven very satisfactory but this is ridiculous; cannot even find any info as to how to recover under warranty.  I usually purchase genuine San Disc cards and have never had a problem with one, but the description of this card was appealing and I made the mistake of purchasing.  I highly recommend others stick with San Disc!  I think Amazon should junk this thing... Can you tell I am unhappy!
