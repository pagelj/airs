The price would suggest that it's a sure bet to clean your floors... just don't bet real money! I've been through several cordless vacs and they all lose their efficacy within a matter of weeks. The Lynx is no different, just more expensive. I don't have any animals so hair is not an issue, but I do have kids. Apparently cheerios and cracker crumbs are no match for this overpriced gadget! I haven't found anything else worth a look; my old corded vac and standard broom are continuing to do the job until further notice. Disappointed! Hoover LINX Cordless Stick Vacuum
