Absolutely Wonderful!
Bought this for my husband for his birhtday/Christmas present.  He reviewed many cameras over a long period of time and chose this one in red.  He is not a professional photographer but loves taking pictures.  It has a magnificent zoom, which he has used to photograph the moon at night and dusk.  He has taken daytime, evening and nighttime pictures.  All have come out beautifully.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who would like an easy to use camera with excellent picture quality.
