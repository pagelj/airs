- it looks great. I've bought at least 6 coffee makers in the past 12 years. So far it's the best looking coffee maker I've ever had.- The coffee tastes good. You still can't compare with pour-over coffee but I agree with other reviewers that it tastes much better than other "normal" coffee makers.- I have problem with the warming plate. My previous coffee maker comes with a Thermal Carafe - I think that works much better than the warming plate. It generates horrible smell of burned coffee which really bothers me and my 5 years old (We got sensitive noses I guess.) Although it does keep the coffee warm but it does change the flavor of coffee - if you change the warm setting to the lowest level, the change of flavor becomes subtle but still turns bitter. Now I just directly turn it off right after the brewing and pour the hot coffee to my old Thermal Carafe.
