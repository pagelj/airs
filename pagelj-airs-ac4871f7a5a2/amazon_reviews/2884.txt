Works great for me
For the low price (<$20) this is a great product and I have to give it 5 stars.  It mounted easily to my 19" TV and to the wall.  I used a stronger screw for the attachment to the wall based on some reviews on the supplied screws (instructions *do* say not to over torque the screw).  For leveling the unit, since there is no built in adjustment for that, I put my level on the TV plate, not the wall attachment, and then marked the position of the unit on the wall - then I was careful when attaching the TV to the unit to avoid any tilt since there is some slop in the screws until snugged.  Another approach - mount the arm to the TV first, then attach the upper screw only to the wall but don't fully snug it up.  Level the TV and then attach the bottom screw into the wall and snug them both (you may need help depending on the size of the TV).
