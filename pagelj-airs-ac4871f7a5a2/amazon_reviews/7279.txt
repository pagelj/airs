Great for carrying things on long outings - BE SURE TO MEASURE YOUR DOG FIRST
This backpack is pretty awesome. It holds up really well in beating sun and through mud and being rubbed against trees. It's also nice to be able to load it up with water bottles to give my dog more of a workout. When I put it on him, he stops pulling on the leash and seems much more focused like his mission is to carry the backpack to our destination. Bit of advice for fit, though, make sure you measure your dog. I guesstimated and the large is too big for my dog, a 70lb German Shepherd, but even though it's a bit loose around his chest & waist, the front chest strap fits well so it doesn't slide around on him unless the weight distribution on each side is uneven.
