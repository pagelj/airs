Nice camera you wont be disappointed
This camera takes great pictures and I love the zoom on it. I am able to get nice shots and videos even from far away. It has been great for the kids concerts too because you can adjust the viewer to still see what you are recording. This is if you have to hold the camera over your head to get around that tall person sitting in front of you! :) I am not at all tech savvy, but this camera is a point and shoot so it is easy to learn. It has great battery life. It has a rechargeable battery, my old camera ate through batteries like crazy but this one I haven't had to charge since Christmas!
