This is my first impression.  This thing is great.  We will not be going to McDonalds ever again.  Little advice.  if it is a large-xlarge egg, use a little more water.  if it is a medium egg use the directions.  It was not runny just personally i like my eggs fully cooked to a scrambled consistancy.  If i have issues in the future, I will buy anoother one.  30 bucks for a great machine like this is worth buying once a year.  Think about the cost savings.  Im sure you will save more than 30 bucks if your a avid breakfast eater.  you should eat breakfast every morning.  it is the most important meal of the day.  that is why they call it Break Fast.  Your breaking the 8hour + fast.... Cheers...
