Simple and amazing
I never write product reviews unless I feel I got shafted, but I just got this item last week and am thoroughly happy with it. Simple design and the price was right compared to the OEM mounts I was considering. The two most impressive features are the suction cup (which actually stuck very well to my somewhat porous dashboard once I cleaned it with some water on a paper towel) and the fully adjustable one touch attachment of my phone (Motorola Razr MAXX) with the Verizon kickstand case on it.  Seems really solid at this point, great purchase!
