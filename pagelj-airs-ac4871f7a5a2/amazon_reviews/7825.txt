Mother loved it
I am one of 5 and for months our mother talked about getting one. So for Christmas we all went together and bought he one. Can I just say she was stoked and beyond thrilled with the product. She takes it everywhere and she is not real computer Savvy but has this under control. Doesn't have to ask many questions when using or downloading anything. Not to mention my father is against technology big time and he also loves this product. My mom ended up buying him one for their anniversary bc he took hers to work. Ha ha needless to say both my mom and dad are beyond ecstatic about the product.
