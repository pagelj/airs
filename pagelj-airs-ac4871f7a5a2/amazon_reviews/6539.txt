What a relief
My old back pack was ripping at the seams. I've only had it for a year, so when it started getting too bad I looked up backpacks here on Amazon. I found the JanSport backpack and bought it after a bit of research. I'm very happy about my purchase. I love the front pocket. It holds A LOT of stuff. It doesn't even look like it would hold so much, but you can just keep piling things in there. The backpack itself also holds a lot. I always saw other people at school with these backpacks and thought they didn't have much in them, because they still looked fairly empty. Now I know that that is just how the back pack is! Glad I bought this backpack. Very sturdy and a lot more comfortable/compact than my old one.
