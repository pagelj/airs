Excellent Laptop That Is Well Worth The Money!
I am a freshman at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas and I have been laptop hunting for awhile. I finally decided on this one. Not only is it super affordable, compared to the overpriced HPs and Asus models available at LU's on-campus bookstore, but it has Windows 8 which is super fast and crystal clear. I love my laptop, and I have only had it for a few days! It is easy to use, very fast, and an excellent size. I recommend buying the separate $129 coverage for accidental spills and drops. Better safe than sorry, and the customer service is top-notch.
