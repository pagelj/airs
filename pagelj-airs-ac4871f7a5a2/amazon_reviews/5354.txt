Good laptop, good price.
I bought this laptop as an Xmas gift for my daughter whose previous computer lost an argument with the floor.  Making this purchase was cheaper than fixing the broken laptop.  I tested this before giving as a gift and it worked very well.  It came with Windows 7 and some other programs pre installed.  Spent Xmas day transferring data files from one laptop to the other.  This is a refurbished Dell and it worked fine right out of the box.  Other than making the purchase, I had no need to contact the seller.  This came shortly after I ordered it and well before Christmas.  I'm very happy with purchase.
