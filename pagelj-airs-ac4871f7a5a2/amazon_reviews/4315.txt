wonderful units at incredible price!
Bought these for my CRV after searching online and am very pleased with these units. Even paying a local auto electronics installer (yes it is complicated and the instructions are not helpful), I still came out way ahead of retail pricing on similar units. DVD player has excellent quality and the wireless headsets with games are just HITS with my kids even on shorter drives. Plays all types of DVD media as well and zippered colors blend in well with interiors without being bulky or conspicous from the outside. Vendor packed well and shipped on time and thus am very happy with this purchase.
