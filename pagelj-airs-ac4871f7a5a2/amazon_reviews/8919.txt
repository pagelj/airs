Outstanding Product
Have owned this charger for over a year and have recharged/discharged it through probably 75 cycles during that time.  It consistently charges an iPhone 3Gs about 5 times on one charge.  Size is convenient.  Couldn't live without it.  If you have an iPhone, this is a necessary accessory.
