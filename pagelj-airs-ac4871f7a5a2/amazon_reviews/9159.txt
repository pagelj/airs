Just... bad.
Gave it one star because I can't give it none. While it may fit the screen, it doesn't stick well which doesn't matter much because its super reflective screen makes it nearly impossible to see if any amount of bright light hits it. Mine even gave me issues with the touch-screen because it would delay and/or not recognize my touch. If you need a protector for you S3, avoid this one. Wish I hadn't wasted my money.
