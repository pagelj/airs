Entertaining and thoughtful SF
Some books you read really stick with you.  They become a standard that pops up in your mind as a sort of side note to the action in your life.  A phrase or an idea that applies to the situation or just a moment of musing.  I have a few of those stuck in my mind and Old Man's War sort of crept into that line up.  I didn't expect to like this book quite so much when I read it, I admit.  I didn't even realize that it was that great after I read it: I just liked it.  However, as I hit my 40's and aging and children and the future I can affect but not inhabit start to matter more to me, this book is starting to speak up in my mind. I know there's people out there mocking me right now.  Sure, there's a lot more meaningful, better written or more worthy books that would make a better mental guide (haha).  But when I read this I wasn't looking for something like that.  I wanted some entertainment and it delivered.  The main character acts with grace and aplomb and offers a soothingly likable narrator. The science fiction view of the future is engaging and the action/violence is offered both with (dark)humor and empathy.  Am I making the book sound boring?  I guess it could be, for those looking for fast action or, inversely, great literature.  If you're looking for entertainment, this is sort of like a book with a hidden bonus.  Some of you will not find the bonus; some of you will say it's lame; and others will enjoy the little extra ideas it had and value it a bit more. Anyway, I really liked it. My father, who is in his 60's, also liked it.  And that's saying a lot.
