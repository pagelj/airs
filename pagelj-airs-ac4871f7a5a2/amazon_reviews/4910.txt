I am very disappointed with this trashcan.  Within 1.5 months of purchasing the system, it's already malfunctioning.  The trash can opens of its own accord and remains open until you push the close button.  Then, it opens up again.  However, when you try to open the can utilizing the motion sensor, the can doesn't open.  I am so frustrated,  I can't believe more people haven't posted regarding this problem.  I would strongly advise against purchasing this product.
