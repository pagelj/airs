Can't be beat as far is price is concerned
Bought this to go with a digital camera for the holidays.  Though the original packaging was missing.  I saved nearly 60% in cost versus a store bought equivilent.  I would recommend scanning any store bought memory for viruses... there have been instances where the devices have been loaded up at the manufacturing site, without the manufacturers knowledge... all in all good purchase.
