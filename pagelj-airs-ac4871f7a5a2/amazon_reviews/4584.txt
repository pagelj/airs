Great hi-carbon knives
Great knives, but NEVER PUT IN THE DISHWASHER! Hi-grade, low carbon steels are designed to be hard and therefore used to retain a sharper edge longer than the softer, more ductile steels. However, the lower carbon levels means there is more iron and therefore knives will rust if left in damp, humid conditions such as a dishwasher. Look after them and they will look after you.
