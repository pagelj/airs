Great lense
Purchased the Sigma 70-300mm and I have to admit that I am very pleased with it but I thought it would be a good idea to give the pros and cons that I see with this lense The "cons" of this lense include:. very noisy auto focus. macro feature is small ( have to be in the 200-300mm range). slight chromatic distortion (color loss) in low light, very low light. not real fast f/4 - 5.6. tripod needed in low lightNow on to the positivesPros:. very very sharp lense. well made (not cheap). true macro feature. metal lens mount (not plastic). auto focus works great in good light. full depth prited on lens. will work with nikon D40,40x,50,60,70,70s,80,90,200...... ED glass. many lens elements (helps with lense distortion).= to a 465mm with 1.5x factor (Nikon). wonderful balance throughout its lense range. slight pincussion but not bad. GREAT LENSE FOR THE PRICEI usually shoot with nikon glass and was reluctant to purchase this lense but after having it almost two weeks now and with well over 200 pictures on it, I think this lens is great! It has produced pictures of the same if not better quality than some of my Nikon glass, even the 2.8! If you are a budget minded photographer or just do not want to pay the outrageous price of the name brands, this thrid party will suit you fine. Simply put, I would highly recomend this lens to anyone wishing to upgrade from a "kit lens"
