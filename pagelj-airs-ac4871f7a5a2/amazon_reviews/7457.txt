The Scoop is very disappointing but is not a total failure.  The first issue that I didn't like is that if you are using a standard ceramic coffee mug, the coffee splashes as it lands in the mug and makes a mess.  The clean up after brewing leaves one with a lot of grounds in the scoop and basket.  It does brew HOT coffee... it may be a bit too hot for some.
