After reading the reviews here on Amazon I felt I only had one choice for a replacement of our Oreck XL. I followed the suggestions about BB&B coupons and purchased my NV502 (identical to NV501 except for accessories) for $200+tx. We could not be more satisfied... well it could be all it is and weigh 5 lbs less and I'd like it to change its own accessories but I guess that's to be included on the next Shark model. ;-)
