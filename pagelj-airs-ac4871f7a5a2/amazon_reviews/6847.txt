GREAT coffee maker - elegant looking and is smaller than many other brewers. Makes a great cup of hot coffee. Only issue I have with it is it leaves coffee residue in the bottom of the cup - the filters do not work like paper filters. Would be nice if Hamilton Beach made small thin paper filters to go with it.
