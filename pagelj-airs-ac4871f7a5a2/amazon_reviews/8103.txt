Software Program Is Flaky
When this worked it gave good pictures, but after about 300 pictures it would fire a second time right after you took a picture, giving you a picture of your feet or such. Then you would press the fire button several times and it would not take a picture then eventually it would fire, not always in focus, you can imagine how frustrating that was. The photos are good but the software program running it is clearly flaky and the auto focus would not stick every time. I intend to break it into a thousand pieces and would have done that on vacation if I didn't need it, it was that frustrating and I wish I had bought the Canon I had originally considered buying.
