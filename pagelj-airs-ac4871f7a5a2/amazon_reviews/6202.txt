Thought provoking and very scary!!!
Could we end up like this in our future?  What would the world be like without books??  This story gives us some insight into what it might be like... and it's pretty scary.  It is definitely food for thought regarding censorship.  The book paints a dim and scary picture of a future society where all books have been banned.  Firemen no longer fight fires, the set them to destroy houses found to have books.  With the removal of books, people have turned their attentions to TV and as a result the general population is unable to think for themselves and their minds have turned to mush.  The main character begins to challenge these concepts of censorship after meeting a young teen-ager who stirs his curiousity.  The more he thinks about and challenges the 'norms' of society his world is turned upside down. This book really makes you think about censorship and where it can lead.  The book is very relevant to the debate going on about censoring today's music (as well as books, tv and movies).  You can't put limits on creativity and self expression without limiting the society as a whole.
