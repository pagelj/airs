First time ever using "sucks" as a good thing... it's a vacuum and boy does it ingest the dirt and grim.  Seems to pull itself across the carpet it is so powerful.  We are using it in new construction and had planned to buy something "better" once the building dirt was gone.  Might just keep this one it's that good.
