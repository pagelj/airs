Bottom line: The butter knives seem a little less than quality, metal sharp and thin. The spoons and forks are great... no fading through dishwasher or breaking at seems. I'm happy with the spoons and forks and glad a made the purchase, I bought them very bargain cheap... less than advertised on Amazon currently. Use has been over a month. If you are okay potentially tossing the butter knives or working with them anyway... I would say wait for a bargain price. I would not pay more than 15 for this set if it were me.__________________________________________________________________________________________________I purchased it because I had my heart set on a set of cute polka dot cutlery... and even though reviews were less than great ... for a good deal... I was willing to gamble. If I had paid more I would rate these 3 stars. So far we have had good luck with the product we've mainly been using the spoons as I use them with my cereal in the morning to start my day off with something cute to cheer me up. The spoons are great! I havent had them break at all... I've been using them with normal force and cleaning in a dishwasher. The dots havent rubbed off for me yet. (Had them about a month... I've used the blue dot spoon at least 4 times and run it through washer 4 times... no fading yet. The forks are fine as well. I'll be honest, I'm a little nervous to use the butter knives so I haven't been attempting them much. This is because the metal seems a little thin... and the other reviewers mentioned it being rough and breakable... the metal does seem less than quality in the butter knives. I'm nervous to cut a pork chop and find jagged metal in it... so I may not use them.
