Excellent value...
I saw some reviews that complained about the screws. They're not comepletely terrible, but I did go to the local supply store a bought a few just to be certain.  I bought this to mount a 52" Sony Bravia.  Installation was simple.  I loved the mounted level on the bracket and the HDMI cable included works fine.  This isn't a deal too good to be true because it actually is true.
