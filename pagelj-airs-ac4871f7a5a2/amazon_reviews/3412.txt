Value Priced, But Still a Bit Too Slow for MP4 Video
I purchased the Kingston MicroSDHC flash card for use in a Motorola EX124G smart phone. The smart phone can play MP4 movies as well as a some other audio and video formats. The MP3 audios play well using the Class 4 (4MB/s) card. Conversely, the videos, despite extensive experimentation with MP4 quality and sub-format variations, continue to pause on occasion. Before the purchase, a friend recommended that I not buy anything less than a Class 8 for use in a smart phone. I can be a bit cheap on occasion and tried to save some money on a 16GB card. It appears he was right and I was wrong. I've bought a lot of Kingston memory over the years and feel comfortable with that brand. The SD Adapter is a nice touch, although, as it turns out, the card reader I bought from Amazon a few months earlier can read microSD cards directly. All and all, I'll use the card for audio and look forward to the price of higher speed high capacity cards coming down in price in coming months. I recommend the card as a value priced storage option that is fine for audio, but not at least for some video.
