VHS to DVD transfer
I bought a computer program with analog to digital in order to transfer old kids tapes to DVD , but it was too much of a hassle so I purchased the Magnavox  VHS/DVD player/recorder and it works great. Easy set up and the quality is as good as the tape . The refurbished unit is as good as a new one
