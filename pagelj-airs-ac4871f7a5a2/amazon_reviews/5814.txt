Not as Advertised
This was billed as holding most 17" laptops.  Not true.  I managed to squeeze my 15.6" laptop in, but not my 17".  The shoulder straps are rather insubstantial, not up to the quality I'm used to in Swiss Gear.  The entire bag feels more cheaply made than other Swiss Gear products.
