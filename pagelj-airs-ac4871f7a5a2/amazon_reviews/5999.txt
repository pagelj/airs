Fits Nikon P510 perfectly
This case seems like it was made perfectly for a Nikon P510. Bunch the camera strap to the rear and drop down sideways; When it's time to take a picture, pull up on the strap and you're ready to go. There are many extra pockets for camera cable, SD cards, spare batteries and such, so that is not an issue either. It's not a very large case, but is just the right size for my camera without looking like a diaper bag.
