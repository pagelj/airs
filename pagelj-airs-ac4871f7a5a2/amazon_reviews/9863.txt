Within the past two months, I have returned two of these Hoover vacs for the same reason: The brush roll stops shutting off on my hard wood floors after using it for a few weeks. Surprisingly, both these vacs had the same issue. Otherwise, when it was working fine, it was an excellent vacuum. Amazing on carpets, pretty good on hard wood floor (perhaps not as clean in picking up fine dust as my swiffer vacuum, but swiffer is not as powerful!), and I was able to use the extensions under the furniture. I will be contacting Hoover, since reading the other reviews, it looks like nobody else had this issue. But, if I don't hear a satisfactory reply, I will not make the mistake of ordering a third vacuum. I vacuum almost every other day, thanks to an active toddler, so looks like this vacuum is not up for heavy use!
