About video quality
Just to comment about video quality. I bought it for both features, Photo/Video (40%/60%). Photographs are great but I had concerns about video quality at low light (live music concerts) with color lights, Etc. No camcorder this time, camera had to be small for traveling and all the time in one pocket. 'Point & Shoot' cameras are great taking beatiful videos these days. No DSLRs are permitted at most of the (music) events or awards. Well, video quality is fantastic ! On YouTube, 2 videos were shot with Canon Powershot S100, 1080p. If you know how to look:Video 1: kCD6PrwoHkc (soundcheck. 1 minute)Video 2: YAin39TU3EE (live concert. 4 minutes)A lot of walking/motion, but this is to let you check how it works at low light
