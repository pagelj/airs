Roku XS rocks!
The Roku XD has been our sidekick for entertainment for over a year now. The remote control is a little clunkie, but once you get the hang of it---not so bad. The fault of the remote is in the centrally located "OK" button. However, it is much easier to use with Netflix than the computer and has saved us a ton of money. This is a 780p device on a 780p TV. We found the XD needs ventilation. We opted for a second device and, again, went through all the research only to settle on the upgrade Roku XS. This box is smaller than the XD. Our kin use other brands, but were extremely impressed with the 1080p clarity, the relocated "OK" button, and, of course, Angry Birds. Though we are not into games, it was still fun to play with the family. We have set this up with Netflix at no additional cost for a second device, free Pandora and other free channels. Our kin are now converts. We are extremely pleased with our choice: no cable bill; outstanding picture quality; game feature; improved remote; and rock solid value. The Roku XS could have been rated as 4-stars for lack of a better search keyboard. But for all the features, picture quality, does not require line-of sight to operate the remote, and Amazon service, we have to rate this as a strong 5 stars.
