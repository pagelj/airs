Quandary
Although I understand why there are negative reviews for this book, that are correct in their particulars, I still have to be overwhelmingly positive. Overwhelmed is how I feel just having finished reading this book. I could also stop to quibble about this or that but there is no avoiding my overall impression. The author has conceptualized a world view of humanity and godhood and created a believable work of fiction that has left me pensive and inspired. What more can I ask of a work of fiction?
