excellent product for the money
Our last dvd player was no longer playing dvds without freezing or blacking out, and I needed a replacement quick. I went to Amazon, read the reviews, searched and selected this one. Inexpensive, easy install, and 2-day delivery with Prime. The footprint matches my cable box, as if they were a set. Picture quality is great.
