I got this coffeemaker about a year ago and am quite pleased with it.  Mind you, I did countless hours of research before picking this model because I was tired of having coffeemakers that couldn't make a hot cup of coffee. The Cuisinart 1200 def. makes it HOT! It is too warm to drink quickly so you def. want to sip this brew when you first pour it.  In contrast, I bought two of the grind n brew model by Melitta as gifts and was disappointed when I sampled the tepid coffee each made.  Very big difference in heat. I also have to comment about just how good the coffee tastes.  Every pot of coffee I make in this machine comes out tasting as good as coffeehouse brew (IMHO).  It is very consistent.  Maybe the built-in water filter helps on this more than you might think.  dunno.  As for the issue of it being hard to pour water into the machine, I have not had a problem with that.  Just don't pour in a hurry, I guess.  I think the carafe does a terrific job of pouring water and, in that regard, you can pour fast w/out spillage.  I also do not mind the lid at all.  Easy to take off and pop right back on. To sum up, this machine performs every bit as good as it looks.  And it's solidly built.  And if, like me, you've been looking for a machine that makes hot coffee, your search can end here. ONE CON:  The clock is pretty lame.  C'mon Cuisinart, what is the big problem with upgrading to a bright, blue easy to read clock display?  We have the technology!  And it can't cost THAT much.
