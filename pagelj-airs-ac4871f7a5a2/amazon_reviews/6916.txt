Only one thing wrong
We are ordering our second  Cuisinart toaster oven. We only had two problems with the first one. Chipping paint and inconvenient crumb tray removal from the rear. Current model still has that. When the engineers figure a way to clean from the front, we shall get another one and give it five stars rather than four.
