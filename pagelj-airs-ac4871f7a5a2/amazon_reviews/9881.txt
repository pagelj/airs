Acer 5750Z
Great low cost laptop that more than meets my needs.  A 500GB Harddrive, DVDRW (8x Pioneer), and multicard reader round out the storage devices. The 15.6 inch LCD screen which is crisp and very readable is also backlight.  The CPU is a Intel dual core 2.0GHZ.  Overall its a fast booting machine, running Windows 7 Home Premimun, that has cut many of my tasks in half. For instance a video conversion that took one hour to complete now takes only 30 minutes or less. It runs many of my xp 32 bit prograns right out of the box.  I like the mesh texture of this laptop compared to my other Acer laptop which is smooth.  The keyboard has a seperate numeric key pad and is nearly the same size as a normal desktop PC. It is easy to type on and i like the feedback i get from it when i type.  I have been getting at least 4.5 hours or more out of the battery so battery life hasnt been a issue. I only have 4GB ram but i am going add another 4GB, to take it to the maximum of 8GB. If you are looking for a laptop that meets basic needs such as surfing the net, office productivity, play games. Or complex tasks such as video conversion and give you the most bang for the dollar then this laptop is what you are looking for.
