This is a very disappointing machine. Starts out great... coffee hot and ready quickly. However, they are known to have pumping and brewing problems that have not been fixed over a number of years. No idea why Keurig hasn't created a permanent fix. I am on my third and am returning it once more. But, this time I will go to another manufacturer. Read about this online. Huge issue. Don't waste your time.
