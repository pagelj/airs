A great toaster
This toaster looks super cool; kind of futuristic retro. You know, like what we thought all appliances would look like in the future, back in 1969. It works good. It makes toast tender yet crisp. What I love is the bagel option where only the inside of your bread/bagel gets toasted. works excellent with buns too.
