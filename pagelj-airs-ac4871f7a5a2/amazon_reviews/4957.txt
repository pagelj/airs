Hot and short story to keep you going with the Rough Riders Series
I am a fan of Lorelei James Rough Riders Series and Slow Rider is a short story of Keely & Jack's wedding which takes place after book 8 and if you have not read them and just want a quick and hot, sexy and steamy tale, then you will enjoy it, otherwise you might get lost in all the going-ons and all those dozen characters you are not familiar with. The series is truly fabulous... hot cowboys and sexy women, steamy and unconventional sex encounters of two  really interesting cowboy dynasties - The McKays & the West families. . I have always loved Keely in previous books and Jack... swoon... what a guy... just perfect for this wild girl. All she wants is to get down on her husband and here she is having to dance, eat cake, dance, walk in on relatives getting it whilst she doesn't..... What a fun read even though I thought it could have been part of the epilogue in Book 8. But hey, this was a free read from Amazon so I should not complain... right!!!! I am really looking forward to the next books in this AWESOME series, which so far I have read in order.
