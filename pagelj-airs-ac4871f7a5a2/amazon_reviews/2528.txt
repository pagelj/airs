GREAT buy !!
Do not purchase a more expensive knife strip....... this one is a fantastic value. The only problem I have with this product, and I do wish I could give 1/2 stars, because I would give it 4.5 stars, is that there are no installation instructions included, but it is fairly simple to install: (it comes with 2 screws which act as tabs, and there are black platic slots on the back, which slide out. Simply mark where the screws will line up and screw them into place, take out one of the tabs, slide one side of the strip onto one of the screws, then slide the tab you took out back into the strip and over the screw "tab". Done.) Still, installation instructions should should have been included. This product holds a 8 inch chef's knife, a 6.5 inch santoku, 2 9 inch slicers, a 9.5 inch bread knife, and about 3 paring knives (about 2.5 inches each) and a serrated tomato slicer (about 4 inches or so). The magnet is very strong and effectively holds the knives in place. This is a much safer method for keeping knives (do NOT store knives in a drawer) and will help to keep them sharper longer. Plus, this is more sanitary than a knife block in my opinion. So, don't spend more on another knife strip. Get this one, you will not regret it.
