Well worth the cost
The product worked as advertised.  I purchased it to copy old VCR tapes to DVD.  It arrived within scheduled delivery date, was easy to set up and easy to figure out how to use.  Was extremely impressed with the quality of the VCR output display.  My current VCR player is over 10 years old and the tapes I play in it skip and are hard to track.  This Toshiba unit is quite an improvement.  Someone else mentioned and I concur; if you have old tapes that haven't been played for several years, it's worth it to fast-forward them through to the end and back a few times so they won't drag when you are dubbing them over to DVD. Very good advice.
