Nice fancier cutlery
We have used these for years when we are having family gatherings or parties and want to use something nicer and sturdier than the much less expensive white plastic cutlery. Unlike the less expensive plastic, these are much less prone to breakage, and perform nearly as well as regular silverware. The proportion of forks, spoons, and knives is also nice. Kirkland is the Costco name, so if you belong to Costco you can buy these for much less at Costco than on Amazon. Another reviewer acknowleges this, but says that he is willing to pay more for the convenience of having this delivered without a trip to the store. That is a legitimate point, but if like me you shop at Costco every week anyhow, then you can just as easily buy it there for less money.
