PHISHING Theory
This charger is wacky- makes iphone go crazy. I'm usually not a conspiracy believer but.... Is it possible that there could be a chip in the charger corrupting phone or stealing info when later docking? Anyone know enough about electronics to dissect one? Both my wife and I have had phones and computers corrupted after using this charger. My calendar is completely screwed up.
