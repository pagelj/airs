Dumb!
I seriously question my own judgement for even finishing this book!  The character development was amateur.  Author bounced around so much that at times I wasn't sure what character was talking.  Very frequently through this book I actually found myself rolling my eyes and saying "yeah right!"  Trust me when I say.... this is one to skip.
