I have posted about this unit before.  However, what I have learned since then has moved my opinion of the unit even farther down the list.  It is indicated it comes with a two year warranty.  What is not indicated is that it is only a one year manufacturer warranty with an additional one year from Good Housekeeping.  Getting warranty service from Good Housekeeping is not easy nor is it fast.  I have been in touch with them multiple times over the past 6 weeks.  Last week they finally told me it would be at least a month before they could make a decision.  "We are a bureaucracy", I was told, and "we don't do anything quickly". In short, don't expect a long life span for the unit or good follow up in trying to use the warranty.
