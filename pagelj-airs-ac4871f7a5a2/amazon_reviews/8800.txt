Great toaster!
This is my second Cuisinart 2-slice long slot toaster.  This one looks great.  Love the beep letting you know the toast is finished.  I do think it could be a little longer and higher.  Some large pieces of bread stick out the top and do not get toasted.  It is definitely slightly smaller than the one I used for years that they no longer make.
