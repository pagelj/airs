Emergency Mylar Thermal Blankets
I don't have any great words of wisdom with this purchase, just that it was what I expected. I bought this for a 'go' pack medical that I am putting together. If someone has sustained massive injuries, they are at risk of shock and will lose body temperature. The intent of the thermal blankets, of course, is to keep them warm when their own body has lost the ability to do this. These are the perfect size - I could keep them in a purse or small bag; they are a bit thick for a 'wallet' size. Considering the low price, the fact you get multiple 'blankets', and that they are easily stored is a no-brainer for purchase on this one.  In an emergency, you may have a bunch of 'regular' blankets hanging around your place - but if these are exposed to the elements, and get wet, they will lose their effectiveness at maintaining body temperature. Mylar reflects the body's own heat, is non-absorbant, and thus well worth the purchase. I may even add a couple of extra since these hardly take up any room at all, and weigh almost nothing.
