Can't wait to take this camera to Disney World!
I've had a few Nikon cameras before so I know they have good products. Yet again, they do not disappoint! There is a very short processing time, which I love and I have a feeling it would be really easy for my low tech dad to operate when I need him. My previous camera, which was a Samsung, was good but the processing took too long and zooming in was a pain. Not so with this camera! Money well spent.
