Samsung s5830 Galaxy Ace--Unlocked Phone
I bought this phone for my teenage son who wanted a smartphone.  I chose the quad band so he could take it overseas and use it there too.  Since I wanted to use it with a T-Mobile pre-paid sim card, I needed to find a sim-lock free phone. The Samsung Galaxy Ace seemed perfect and it's features appealed to my son. Unfortunately, as we found out after only a few months, this phone has not good reception with the T-Mobile sim card. Most of the time it has no reception at all except for the 911 call.  It might be a good phone with other providers but not with T-Mobile. The other features of the phone were fine.  The camera was pretty decent too. The touch screen was not terribly responsive though. I have now bought another phone (this time from a store) for my son which was a lot cheaper, looks similar, and which has excellent reception. Too bad I had to waste nearly 190 Dollars on something I cannot use.  I recommend buying  a cell phone from a store and not online. If you have issues, you can bring it back even after a few months.
