great beginner camera
My hubby bought me this camera as a gift to help me kick off my photography business/hobby. This is a great camera to start learning how to use a DSLR. It still can be used like a basic point and click, but you can also change the settings and learn how to adjust the settings like on a professional camera. It takes wonderful pictures, very crisp. Love it.
