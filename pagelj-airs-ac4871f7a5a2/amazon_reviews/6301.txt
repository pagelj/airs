Rated "P" for Porn
My 13 year old daughter is a huge fan of Warcraft, and when I went looking for a Warcraft experience on the PSP, the guys at the game store recommended God of War for her. I'm used to seeing the Mature rating on games, but this game should have been rated "P" for Porn. For those parents who haven't been told, there is a scene about 20 minutes into the game where the character has to please two naked women in bed before they can move on to the next stage. I've been a gamer all my life and this is the first interactive porn I've seen in a major title.
