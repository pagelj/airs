Light, Funny, and Smart Sci-Fi
I really enjoyed Old Man's War. It's a fun, smart, quick read with lots of action. I thought the concepts in this book were really thought provoking - for example, going to war in space after turning 75 and the way humans have invaded space and fight for territory. If you are looking for smart sci-fi that is light and fun to read, then this is the book you should pick up. I will definitely be checking out the rest of the books in this series.
