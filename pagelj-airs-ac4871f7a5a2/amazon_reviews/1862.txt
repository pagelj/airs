Wear it front or back
I bought this as a gift for a severely handicapped senior citizen to carry her little Canine Assistant chihuahua with her when she goes out in her motor chair or rides in a car.  It is VERY high quality, and has side pockets to carry a small water dish, a small food dish and treats.  I was very impressed with the high quality and low price.  Although you don't get to choose which color you receive, it is truly a good product for a small dog or a quick trip to the vet with a small cat on a public bus.  It also has a collar clip inside, but needs just a slightly thicker and softer padding in the bottom for comfort, but that's so easy to do yourself.  I think if it was just 2 inches deeper and an inch wider, the dog (or a cat) would be able to curl up on the bottom more comfortably, but it can be worn in front or in back as it has a human waist strap to secure it from falling off.
