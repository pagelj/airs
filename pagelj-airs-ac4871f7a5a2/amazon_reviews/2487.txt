Very simple, sturdy, and does it job
I have my game consoles hooked up to the Sima SVS-14 4 Input Manual A/V Selector, and then I purchased these cables to hook the A/V switcher box to my TV. The cable length was just right being at 6ft -- not too short and not too long. The quality of the cable is unbelievable being at such a low price. The cables are somewhat thick, but they feel very sturdy and durable. What else can you say about these cables? They do the job intended.
