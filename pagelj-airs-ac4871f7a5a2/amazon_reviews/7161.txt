I have been using this set for several months now, and I have been very pleased.  I have been sure to take really good care of them (no dishwasher - always hand-washed immediately after use) and they still look as good now as they did when I pulled them out of the box.  I've had more expensive knives that held an edge slightly better, but these are a fantastic value. The only problem that I have with this set is the steak knives - while functional, they are definitely not of the same quality as the rest of the set.  If I were to make the purchase over again, I would probably order the smaller set of Premio knives and order a separate set of steak knives.
