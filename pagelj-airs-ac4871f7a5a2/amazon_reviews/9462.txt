Phone looks great, but I can' get service to work.
I purchased this phone on Amazon.  The phone is big, bright and responsive to the touch  I then purchased a ATT SIM card for Straight Talk on Amazon.  I inserted the SIM and the phone recognized it.  I then contacted Straight Talk to set up service and port my current phone number from my old Verizon phone to this new phone and SIM card.  According to Straight Talk and the SIM seller, the SIM is active with my phone number, however, the phone is not picking up any cell service at all.  I have been emailing and talking with Straight Talk and the SIM provider for a few days with no luck.  I don't know if it is the phone or SIM.  I think I would love the phone if I could get the cellular service to work.  Has anyone had this issue?  If so, how did you resolve it?
