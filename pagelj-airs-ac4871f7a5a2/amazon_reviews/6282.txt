Great Sci-Fi Classic
Just finished reading 'The Forever War' by Joe Haldeman. 9/10Pretty good sci-fi classic about the waste and lasting damage that war does to the human soul. Written by a Vietnam Vet who knew pretty good physics. A definite read for sci-fi lovers. I hope they make this into a movie soon.
