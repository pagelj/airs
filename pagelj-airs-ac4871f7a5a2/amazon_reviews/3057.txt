Another one of Rick's masterpieces
I was so excited when this book came out. I started reading immediatly and loved it at every letter. Rick has not dissapointed me! The only part really didn't like so much was the end. Why? a)Rick leaves us with a cliffhanger and b)My personally favorite two heroes fall into Tartarus. Some people may have already spoiled it, and I intend not to.  Anyway, another one off Rick's masterpieces. However, I'll admit that I am starting to miss the young Percy Jackson. Right now, he's a lot more confident and cleverer. Yes, I do miss his flaws: doubtful, foolish at times, and also his nature to challenge, take risks, and use his crazy ideas.  But these are my opinions, and I hope other people enjoy it as much as I did.
