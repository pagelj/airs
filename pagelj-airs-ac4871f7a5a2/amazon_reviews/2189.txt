Great product... I love it.
This was perfect for me dubbing my old VHS-C tapes.  The picture quality was excellent and for the price it was awesome.  I did notice the VCR played my tapes with some tracking issues but it was because I havent watched these tapes in a long time and they were probably sticking or something.  The only thing is that it is tricky to learn to DUB.  You have to read several sections first in the manual to get started an learn the features/icons.  For the most part it was pretty intuitive. It doesnt feel flimsy and feels well built which is nice.  Glad I bought it.
