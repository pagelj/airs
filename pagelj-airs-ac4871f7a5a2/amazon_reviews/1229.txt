Screen Protector Not Necessary.
Ok, if you really like this sort of thing, but it is not necessary at all. Good thing they are not expensive. Really a waste of time and money, although very easy to put on the phone. I used one, which quickly began to irritate me with the streaking. Removed it and never used the rest. No problem with using my LG 840G without this screen protector.
