I NEEDED A RECEPTACLE FOR MY TRASH,A RECEPTACLE THAT DID NOT LOOK LIKE A COMMON TRASH CAN. THE SUNCAST RESIN WICKER TRASH HIDEWAY WAS THE PERFECT ITEM. STURDY,COMPACTYET IT HOLDS A 30 GALLON BAG VERY COMFORTABLY. ATTRACTIVE WITH A LOCKING LID AND THEENTIRE TOP OPENS UPWARD FOR EASY REMOVAL OF THE ENCLOSED BAG. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS ITEM AVAILABLE.
