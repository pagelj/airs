Nice price point for a 12MP Nikon DSLR
I wanted to upgrade from my Nikon D40 but didn't want to spend a ton of money on a D300s or even the new D7000.  So I bought the D90 and have been very happy with it. It is much easier to access features on this camera over the D40, making the D90 more user friendly. Picture quality is very good and I've been pleased with the camera overall. The only negative of this camera is that there is a memory card/card reader problem. There is an error that will appear randomly and if you do a search you will discover that the D90 has trouble with reading/writing to the memory card. Sometimes it's an intermittent problem. Sometimes it requires the camera to be serviced. Sometimes it seems to be an issue where the D90 doesn't like certain brands of SD cards. There is no clear consensus as to what exactly is wrong but the fact is a fair number of D90 users report memory card errors. I've had this issue once. The camera, just a few months old, wouldn't take a picture and "CHA" was displayed as an error message. I turned the camera off and removed the memory card, reinserted the memory card and powered the D90 back up and it worked fine. Hope this isn't a continuing issue. Other than that the camera is great!
