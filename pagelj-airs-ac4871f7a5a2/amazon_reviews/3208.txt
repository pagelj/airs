LOVE IT !!!
Been looking at this bag for awhile and finally decided to get it and I LOVE it! It's great for when you're out on location, biking, hiking, etc. Super comfortable (unlike a lot of similar bags I tried on, that felt like you had a box strapped to your back), well built and gives you easy access to your camera (so you don't have to even take the bag off to access it). This bag holds your camera in an adjustable suspension sling, which allows you to safely store your camera fully assembled with larger sized lens hood and all!
