I purchased the Nikon AW100 for my recent trip to Cabo, Mexico.  I was so impressed by the quality and toughness of this camera so far.  I took it in the salty ocean, in the pools, used as a regular point and shoot, taking pictures of landscapes while our driver is going well over the speed limit. And all the pictures and videos turned out awesome.  It's funny to think that I washed my camera in the sink after every underwater or sandy use.
