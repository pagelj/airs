Sweet!
This thing has so much space!  I've packed in several text books, a laptop, a charging doc and handheld mobile computer along with flash drives, external harddrive and a bunch of other stuff and still had plenty of room.  Big zippers and lots of pockets to keep secure and organized.  Only thing I don't really like is the laptop bay since the size adjustment just Velcro's in, doesn't seem that secure but would be great if you had a 17" laptop.
