Droid X
This phone does it all! I love how easy it was to figure out the how too's about it. The only thing it doesn't do as well as I would like is making or receiving an actual phone call. I almost always have to have it on speaker setting to hear the caller; not usually a big deal except when talking to my non-texting Mom!
