Close but no cigar
Ordered these for a Galaxy S II, Sprint Mobile version SPH D710 -- as stated by other reviewers, the protectors are a bit short on both the long and short sides of the phone by about 1/4" -- otherwise fairly good quality and prompt shipping -- if you are not expecting a perfect fit thenthese will suffice
