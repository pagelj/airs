Fits my Canon Rebel T3 perfectly
It fits my camera like a glove (with the standard lens), is easy to put on and remove, and can be quickly stuffed away when you want to get right to shooting, or you can use the little belt clip to keep it nearby while you use your camera. Also comes with a small pocket for additional memory cards or other small, flat things. Perfect. I love it.
