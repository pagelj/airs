"eh"
Bought an adaptor for my iphone 4 because last time i bought one online it worked as well as the one that apple provides with your iphone. But this time, i tried this seller and the charger barely worked, taking half an hour just to charge 2%. I complained and they said they'll send me a new one and this new one charges like 3% per 10 minutes. Better than the first one they sent, but not recommended. You'd rather get your dollars worth of a charger adapter elsewhere.
