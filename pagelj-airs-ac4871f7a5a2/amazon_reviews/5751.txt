Works Great
This device works well with my IPod and LG phone. I have used it at more than 30 feet away and still works like it is a wired ear bud set. It wears like a necklace and I forget I even have it on until I receive a call and it starts vibrating. Best Bluetooth I have owned. I would recommend this product.
