Best one we have EVER had
We love having a monitor to view the baby. We have had several go bad on us despite having high reviews so we turned to the Motorola. We didn't feel the extra $50 was worth the ability to zoom so we went with this model. Camera: The rotating ball is a bit tricky to get used to when first figuring out how to rotate but you get used to it. The light green light is perfect brightness. Not too bright to cast a glow in the room but light enought to see that it is on. The back has an option for you to mount it on a wall, if needed. Parent receiver: Hate that people rated it low because it couldn't be on mute. The lowest volume is very low and should suffice. The ultimate purpose of a monitor is to HEAR the baby. There's a 1x and 2x zoom option, can play songs and even talk into the mic for the baby to hear (pretty cool, but be careful as they get older because then it becomes a game for them to hear you! lol). I've been impressed with the battery life. The temp reading in the room is always off a couple degrees, but that's not a big thing for me. We have experienced no interferance issues. That was the biggest thing for us with the last 2-3. Bottom Line: Spend the money to get a nice, quality monitor in the first place so you don't have to deal with them going bad with no notice and buying a new one!
