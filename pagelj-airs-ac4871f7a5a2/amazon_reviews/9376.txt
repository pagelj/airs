The Best Chicken Purse Ever!
I picked up this cute little number for my friend Brian D. to complete his camping ensemble. He was complaining that he had no where to store his lip gloss, iPod, Advil and other small items. Brian just got back from his camping trip with the Boy Scouts and Harley Davidson biker Club Weekend Jamboree, and said that his Chicken purse was the perfect accessory for the trip. He said it was the highlight of discussion and everyone loved it. Based on his comments, I would recommend the Chicken purse for anyone who wants to be the center of attention.
