It arrives in 12 pieces like a kid's transformer toy. It clicks together to form different configurations.  It seems to work well.  I am puzzled that the cannister isn't filling up more.  The floor looks clean.  It is easy to push.  At first I didn't think I would like that it wasn't very wide, but that makes it easier to maneuver around things.  It seems well made--I ordinarily otherwise would not like the fact that the different parts click together.  There are some attachments that I am looking forward to using on my baseboards and air vent.  It is also cute.  I gave only four because it is day one, and it didn't make me dinner.  :)Ok, I had not turned on both motors.  There is a motor in the body and another that controls the roller brush.  It propells the thing across the floor and fluffs the carpet.  Five stars.  Cannister full. Update 3-11-13.  It is still fun to use and works well.  I have three dogs that shed.  I like that the cannister empties from the bottom.  The suction is strong and will try to suck up your loose rugs if you don't reduce it to only one motor when going over them.
