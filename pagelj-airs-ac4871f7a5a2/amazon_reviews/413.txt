Small, easy to use, great imagesâ€¦makes me nervous
I purchased the Lumix after reading over 50 reviews on various sites. The commun theme seems to be a failure in the water seals during early usage. based on my long relationship with Amazon, I purchased this camera for our annual family trip to warmer climates. I was amazed at the small size, intuitive nature of the controls and quality of the pictures right from the get go. Because of the reviews, I took the warnings about reading all instructions and followed them to the letter from the moment I took the camera out of the packaging. Our first foray foray into the water (pool) went off without a hitch. Great images, easy to use event the zoom was easy underwater. I took movies and about 50 pictures and saw nothing to concern me. On day two, I noted moisture in the view finder. I ignored it per the instructions and the moisture faded away after the morning. After letting the camera dry out on a towel for several hours, I wiped it down again and then brushed around the opening to confirm no particles. When I opened the battery door, I noted two rivulets of water in the seal track. This would appear to be water that was still pulled in when the door was open. The rivulets were tiny, but still of concern. I love the camera and have not had any issues, but I will be testing it further over the next week. If there are any issues, I will revise my comments and be sending this back to Amazon.
