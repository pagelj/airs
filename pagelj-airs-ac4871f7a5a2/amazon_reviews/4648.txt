I upgraded to this from an older toaster oven thinking that the timer would ensure that I don't leave the oven on. In fact, this timer won't wind down to zero and shut it off if you don't turn it past 10 minutes. Also, if you open the oven door, it still stays on.  Add to this, there are too many knob settings that have to be selected (redundantly) just for making a toast. If you are toasting and the timer doesn't work, you will have a fire! They need to revise the logic of operation.
