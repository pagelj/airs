My kid loves it!  She watches Michael Jackson everywhere she goes!
Seems like a great product.  My daughter received for her 7th birthday and now with her 8th birthday a couple days away, it is still going strong. As usually found with the typical 3 kid household, it has been dropped (multiple times), stepped on, pressed really hard, open with out stopping, turned off without stopping, etc. And still it plays with out a glitch! It is easy for a novice to use (even the SD slot). No special formatting needed just pop in the SD card, select media and it plays whatever is there. I would really recommend this product.  Think I bought it from Walmart not Amazon so I am not a verified buyer on this, but I do own the product not a company rep.
