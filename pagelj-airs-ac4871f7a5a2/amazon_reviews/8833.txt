This Delonghi espresso maker is as described by other buyer reviews. It produces a nice froth. Is moderately hot when made but cools quickly. Filters need to be cleaned periodically or flow can become blocked, but this is not a fault with the machine. Great deal for the money ($93). Have had it for just over a year. No problems yet.
