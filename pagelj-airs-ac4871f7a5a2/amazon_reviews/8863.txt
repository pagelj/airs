Well Worth Reading
I just finished reading this book and I cannot recommend it more.  This book read just like an episode of Star Trek Enterprise.  A good number of the characters were well developed.  Though I do wish that the author had spent a little more time on the villain and the ending did seem forced.  Still I will be buying the rest of this series as soon as I can get the money together.  It was well edited and I only saw a few minor errors.
