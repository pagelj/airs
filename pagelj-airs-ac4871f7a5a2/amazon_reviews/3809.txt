charger doesn't fit ipod touch! wall unit broke in 2 immediately! i hate it.
My daughter waited a long time for this to arrive, it did arrive within the time frame given but maxed it. She was so disappointed when it finally arrived and didn't fit! then she plugged her old cord into the wall adapter and this one broke instantly! cheap. worthless.
