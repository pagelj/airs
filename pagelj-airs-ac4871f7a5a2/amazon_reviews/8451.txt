Not for small hands, but a great knife!
This is a great knife - a little lighter than my preference, but it is sharp, appears sturdy, and the handle has *superb* grip.  I didn't know a handle could be so superbly grippy until using this knife. But!  A caution for the WOMEN purchasing knives... unless you have larger hands than the average gal, consider a smaller knife.  I know, I know - always consider dimensions before you order.  But!  I didn't, and while this knife is still usable, I think a reminder is in order that the size of knife considered "small" or "mini" by many knife manufacturers is actually what women can more confidently and comfortably use.  This is large enough to be ungainly in my hands. Great knife - just double-check that it's the right size for your hand first, by measuring a knife you already know and love.
