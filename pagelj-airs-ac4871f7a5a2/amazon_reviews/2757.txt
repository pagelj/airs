terrible toaster
We bought this toaster to replace our ancient toaster, and I wish we'd kept the old one instead. We've had this oven for a few months now; it worked great for the first week, then went downhill. This oven is fine for the baking function, but for toast (which is what we use it for the most), it is unpredictable and uneven. The bread on one side will burn while the slice on the other side stays light. Infuriating. Also, there is a "toast" function and a "bagel" function; both seem equally bad. This oven also has a hard time toasting thick slices of bread (it doesn't toast them at all). With thin slices, it burns from the top. Argh.
