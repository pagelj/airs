never has worked
i received the egg and muffin toaster for a mother's day gift a few years ago. since i did not need a toaster at that time i left it in the box and put it away. well recently my old toaster went out so i unpacked this brand new one and it does not heat. i contacted the company and they told me i had to buy a new one since it was a couple of years old. lesson learned. check out everything once you get them and make sure they work even if you do not plan on using the item for a while. i would not purchase another one and plan to give this one to goodwill. maybe someone can tinker with it and make it work. waste of money for this product.
