Great Buy
I bought this blu ray for Christmas.  It was a nice decision.  I had tried 2 other brands that I returned because of the over-price and under performance. The Wifi connects to my Access Point flawlessly. You will need a good signal from your access point to take advantage of this machine. Initial Wifi connection rate was 5-10% due its distance from the access point. My access point is upstairs while this machine is downstairs with multiple walls in between.  Had to boost my Access Point signal with a Wifi extender.  Now the signal reception on this machine is 100%.  Internet programs stream with no more annoying refreshing.  I am yet to take advantage of all the apps that came with this machine.  I tried to do that but gave up when they kept asking for my credit cards information to register.  Get your credit cards handy when registering to take advantage of all the apps bundled with this machine. All in all I love this machine. I will surely recommend it.
