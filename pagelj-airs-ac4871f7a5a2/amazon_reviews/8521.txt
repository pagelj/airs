Broke Fast
I received the delivery of this item very quickly. I put it together and stuck it to my windshield and it has been there ever since. Two weeks and it has not fallen off. However, the button that opens the cradle arms broke on the first day the first time I tried to release the arms to take my phone out, and now I have to slide the phone in and out of the holder. It still works though, so I use it, just a pain to slide the phone in and pout of it.
