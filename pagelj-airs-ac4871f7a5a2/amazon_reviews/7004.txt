I loved it til it broke.... literally.
The bag is gorgeous! but the only draw back was the handle and the poor construction. I didnt carry alot in the bag ex. wallet, a journal , chapstick and my car keys. Then the stud holding down the handle broke off... killed my day and broke my heart. I do plan on fixing it but I just wish it hadn't broke to begin with.
