Epic book
This book is a beast.  Scott card is a freak.  He knows so much about, and I hate this term buts its the most appropriate, the human condition, is scary.  The book is fun as hell but its themes of leadership, violence, manipulation give it some real depth and their not thrown in clunkily.  its a very fluid experience.  If you want to learn something about yourself something about the what makes us us and want to have a good time doing so.  Read this book and then read it again.  Epic
