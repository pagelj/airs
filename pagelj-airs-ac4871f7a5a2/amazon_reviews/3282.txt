nikon coolpix p510
my favorite camera. best camera I have ever owned. super easy to use. usually I need to carry manual with camera's in the past. especially when I haven't used in awhile. not this one. everything is laid out for easy understanding and makes it a breeze to work and function. the zoom is unbelievable! had trouble using in concert I went to  taking pictures not using the flash. didn't think by band being 100 ft. away it would ever reach the stage but with spot lights on  the band pictures were coming out white on lead performer? started trying everything I could think of. tryed turning on the flash and that was the trick. don't understand cause no way flash could reach all the way to the stage but guess on automatic camera sets it self up for the picture. once I did that perfect pictures again. was told using camera where lens can't be removed and interchanged almost all concerts will let this type camera in. takes fantastic pictures!!!
