Great phone, ok battery
Currently I've had the phone for abouta month now and I absolutely love it. It is responsive with its beautiful touch screen display. The phone has all the power you would need to do any gaming or multi- tasking. The only issue I've had so far is the battery life but with the two batteries that comes with the phone and its ease of swapping them it has not been much of an issue. I would highly suggest this phone for the price compared to the price of buying a galaxy without a contract.
