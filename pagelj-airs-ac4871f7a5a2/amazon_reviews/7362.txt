A great book, and a must read!!
I've read a lot of different books since I got my kindle last Christmas.  Books I wouldn't normally have access to without it, but I have to say "Wired" was one of the better ones I've come across, with or without the eReader. I normally trend towards Stuart Woods and David Baldacci, two well known authors with solid reps.  I had never heard or read anything from David E. Richards, but I've got to say his style and ability to tell a tale was every bit as accomplished as the more popular gents.  Wired is action packed, thought provoking with just the right amount of humanizing tenderness to complete the circle. I looked forward to reading it each time I found a moment to do so, and dreaded the inevitability of finishing it.  If you've got .79 then invest it in your reading time, you won't be sorry.  It was by far worth a lot more than what I paid for it and I hope Mr. Richards writes some more adult themed novels soon.
