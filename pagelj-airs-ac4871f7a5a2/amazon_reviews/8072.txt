Have had this toaster for over a year of very heavy use by a busy family, and I have NO complaints.  Like how skinny it is (allows it to fit next to my microwave), like how it does bagels, how it lifts the toast up to get it out, etc.  Short cord was not an issue for me because there is an outlet right behind it on my microwave shelf, where it sits.  Only complaint I have is that when I bought it was not available in white, and all my other kitchen appliances are white.  So its the only black thing in my kitchen.  But not the end of the world and certainly not fair to lower its star rating based on that, I knew I was buying a black one when I got it.
