Best Solar Charger I've ever used
I've used many solar chargers and tested alot of products for use in HADR applications. None have performed as well as the Solar Joos. I wish I didn't need a cable adapter to connect to it, but that's a minor consideration in light of the overall design and capabilities of the device.
