Solid case and holster
I have to admit, I was waiting for something, somewhere on this holster to break off. Instead, I've been using it confidently every day with not even a crack. Usually there's some weak point, usually on the holster, that just isn't designed for everyday use. The only thing this one breaks is the rules (knock on wood). Here's to great craftsmanship!
