Quirky but great!
One of the more refreshing shows that I have seen in a while.  The characters of the show are quite quirky but you grow to love the character from the "normal" sheriff in town to the super geniuses of the high IQ place of Eureka.  Good writing and good humor makes this one of the more up-beat show where the average sheriff rescues the town from it's own geniuses.
