This machine looks good. However, the carafe is very heavy - and it's better not to use it to fill the reservoir. Not just because it's heavy, but it takes forever for some reason. The coffee is not hot; even using immediately. Which is a shame because it does taste good; the stop and pour never worked on my machine. It's difficult to clean with the great concept of a shower head to evenly pour the water over the cover; but the attachment doesn't come off to clean so you are trying to clean all these nozzles while it's still in the machine. To make a long story short, my office thinks I picked out a poorly designed and functioning coffee maker. I've used Melitta products all my life; now I'm thinking twice and won't buy a stainless carafe machine; especially a Melitta, again. (You may think the fact that "hot" coffee goes into a carafe will save you electric charges; but the coffee's not that hot and the carafe therefore keeps it lukewarm.)Very disappointed and my office is out $56.00dsl
