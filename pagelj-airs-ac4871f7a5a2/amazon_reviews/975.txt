LCD replacement screen for PSP
I received this without the tools as in description, and returned and reordered the item. I changed the screen myself in about 10 minutes. thought I would need my fiance to help me, but I did it myself real fast with a tutorial I found online. Item was not shipped as described, but I bought the screwdriver(#00) separate and it's awesome! Now my son's psp is like New again!
