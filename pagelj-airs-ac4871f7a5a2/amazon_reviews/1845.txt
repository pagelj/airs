This trashcan is smaller than I imagined when I made this purchase. This product came with three sample 1.2 gallon draw-string trash bags made my Simple Human that can be re-ordered through their website. I am using one of them as a protective liner and I use a plastic grocery bag to keep trash in for easy disposal without having to purchase specialized bags. The trashcan has a removable black bucket that may be removed, so I strategically tuck the plastic bag lining inside and the trashcan looks great in the bathroom with the other stainless steel accessories. Overall, it's just a trash can, and it's a respectable, brand name, which is what lured me to this shiny can in the first place. With that given, there was nothing particularly notable or exciting about this trashcan to put Simple Human 1.2 gallon trashcans above what you could get at Target or Wal-Mart for a little bit less. I do like this trash can, but it's a trashcan.
