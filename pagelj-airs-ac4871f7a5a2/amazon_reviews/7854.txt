Compared to other products..... Leather honey..
I first used this product on a brown lambskin leather jacket.  The Jacket is a size Large, and falls right below my waist.  I applied the leather honey to every inch of the leather on the jacket, and it took just over half of the 8oz bottle.  A little really does go a long way.  After I let the jacket air dry for 24 hours it was almost back to its original/brand new color and feel.  I left a small section on the inside untouched so I could see/feel the difference, and it is remarkable to see how bad my jacket had gotten before I used the Leather Honey.  Also, I own many leather cleaning and conditioning products, and I have quite a bit of leather clothing, so I promise you my opinion on this product is worth checking out. This conditioner is great for jackets, gloves, belts, and purses, but I would stick to mink oil and Apache creme for boots.  Leather Honey does not have the water repelling ability of Mink oil, but it is semi-water protective.  The directions say to use a sponge to apply, but hell it is a lot easier just to use your fingers.  Do NOT allow the leather material to come in contact with anything while it is drying.  Dirt will stick to it like white on Michael Jackson. So, my 2 cents:  buy leather honey if you need to restore/protect/condition any soft, pliable, leather.  It may require multiple coats over several days time.  For boots, stick to products made for boots.
