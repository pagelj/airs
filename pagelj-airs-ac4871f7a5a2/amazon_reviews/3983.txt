Never leaks!
About the only thing people have to say negatively about this product is that it leaks. It does not. I have two and they never ever leak. They keys to using the thermos are: 1) Wash it the night before and let it dry. I think a lot of the perceived leaks come not from the liquid in the compartment, but from water stuck in the underside of the lid after washing. It does hold some water in there for a while. Let it dry. No problem. 2) Don't overfill it. There is a little ridge inside the thermos. Fill it to just below that ridge. If you overfill it, a little liquid ends up inside the compartment, but on top of the o-ring. When you turn it over, that excess liquid will drain out. No more than that though. 3) Let hot beverages cool for a minute before putting the lid on. You'll want to do that anyway, because otherwise the beverage would remain too hot to drink for hours. I love this thermos. People always wonder where I got it. I use mine for coffee at work and I also throw it in my bike bag on rides. During a long, hot ride it's often nice to have a cold drink of water. This does that while hardly adding any extra weight. I have one in stainless steel and one in the sort of bronze color. I like the bronze one more because it has a lacquer finish on it that makes it smoother to the touch and a little easier to clean. The stainless steel, however, is less likely to accidentally slip out of your hand.
