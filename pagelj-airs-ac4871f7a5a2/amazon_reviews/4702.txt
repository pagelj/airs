Canon camera case
This case is the closest thing to what I needed. I did not want a large bulky case.  My Canon XSI with the 18-55 zoom fits snuggly and there is room to carry a 55mm prime lens also. The case is also very well made, with a heavy zipper closure, and pockets to carry all the small items associated for the camera.
