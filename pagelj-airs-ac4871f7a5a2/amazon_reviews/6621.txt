Best reach for the buck! An absolute must for nature shots
I know what you're thinking... should I buy this lens, or the 18-200? That's the quandary I was in. I wanted the convenience of not having to switch lenses, but didn't feel like giving up 50% of the reach. The difference between 200 and 300 is quite noticeable. I bought this lens and have no regrets. The 18-200 is certainly fine but for me the added convenience just wasn't worth the additional 100mm. This lens is generally reviewed as being sharper than the 18-200 as well. And if you're not concerned with sharpness, then why do you even have a DSLR?? I get so many comments/compliments on this lens when I'm out too (because of its size compared to most other "budget" lenses). Not that that's a good reason to buy it, but it doesn't hurt! Oh sure, you can spend 3 or 4 times as much on Nikon's 70-200 (and lose out on 50% of the reach), or you can buy this and have $$$ leftover for many other goodies. True, the 70-200 is reviewed as being sharper, and will do better in low light, but I would certainly hope so at 3-4 times the cost! Weight and size are issue with the 70-200. The 70-300 is very manageable in both size and weight. In low light, this lens isn't very useful but in moderate to good light, it's very sharp. I also have the 18-105 (which I really like), but the 70-300 rarely leaves my camera. For nature it's a must have.
