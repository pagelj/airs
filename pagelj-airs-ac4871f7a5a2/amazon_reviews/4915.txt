Foscam FI8910W purchase and support!
Ralph Mendez did a great job getting me remote access.  Excellent support by the FOSCAM company. I bought directly from the company and it was shipped quickly.  I was able to easily set it up via their instructions to work on my LAN.  However, I could not figure out how to install so I could access via the web.  Ralph gained remote access to my Macbook Pro via Teamwork software and I could see where I went wrong. It only took a few minutes to correct my blundering!
