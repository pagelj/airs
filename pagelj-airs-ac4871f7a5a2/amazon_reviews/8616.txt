An Adventure Awaits!
Free kindle book, so why not, right?  I couldn't put the book down and finished it so quickly.  I'm here buying ALL the other e-books from this author.  Very witty dialogue, twists and turns, and characters have depth.  Simon Dante is a pirate's pirate and Beau is the atypical female lead in this genre, which is a good thing.  The free book ploy worked on me and even at $3.99 is a steal for this fun read.
