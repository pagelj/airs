Toasters are a boring thing to buy, and they usually are annoying - no matter how expensive they seem crappy, eventually toast unevenly, you have to pick things out with a fork, and if the toast isn't done enough you have to stand there for the second time around or you'll burn it. Not this thing. Although it's a bit bulkier and longer than it looks in the photo - with 2 long slots - this is the best toaster I've seen since the 1960s when my parents had an amazing automatic toaster. On this unit you press the botton and it silently lowers the bread into the toaster, where two metal grates surround it until the unit silently raises them again, with a little beep to let you know it's done. It's quick and just elegant. I put a piece of bread in with the factory setting, of 3 out of 5 steps, and it was just perfect right out of the box. There buttons for Toast (lowers it), Defrost, Bagel, and "A Little More." The "A Little More" button is cute because you can put your toast down for only a little bit longer, further customizing it. The defrost button really surprised me. It didn't just defrost the bread, but cooked it slightly longer so it came out to the same degree of perfection as the fresh bread. The cord is extra long, but you don't have to take it all out because it winds around underneath the bottom. The plug has a hole in the middle, making it comfortable to plug in. There is a vent on the side opposite the buttons, but it doesn't get really hot. The body stays cool at all times. Bravo Breville. There is now finally a GREAT toaster out there. This toaster is a pleasure. If you love bakery bread it's especially great because of the long slots that can take bagel-width bread. I can't believe I can get excited by a toaster, but this one was such a pleasant surprise. If you know a couple who will have a decent-sized kitchen, this would be a great wedding gift as well.
