Awesome
I first bought a 27" monitor from ASUS and it is outstanding! When I was looking for a gaming laptop I am a Dell Alienware guy but the price was around orbiting pluto. I checked to see if ASUS had a gaming rig and I found this one and I did a side by side comparison. They were almost identical in every way but the biggest difference was a $2000 between Alienware and ASUS. So I bought this rig and I must say it's smoking hot AWESOME!! I own two Alienware massive computers in my man cave and this laptop can keep up with them in everyway! Outstanding quality and performance. Say yes to this rig you will not be sorry at all.
