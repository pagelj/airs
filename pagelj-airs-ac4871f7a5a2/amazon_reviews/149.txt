Just what I needed for my camera system!
Before I got this flash I hesitated to take pictures at night, especially on social occasions. Now I have all the flash power I need with my little camera (Nikon p5100) and night pictures come out sharp and well exposed. Now I can also use my wide angle lens for night pictures, as this flash does not cast a shadow like the built in flash does. What's more this flash is light and a perfect complement to the p5100.
