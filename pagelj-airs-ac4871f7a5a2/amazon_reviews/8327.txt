Unlocked and Working Great SO Far
I had to jot a quick review because I read and rely on all the reviews before I buy anything on Amazon. This phone arrived promptly and is unlocked and working great. I am in the Middle east and used a local sim card and voila! No problems thus far. I am still learning the nuts and bolts of the phone but am very pleased with it. The touch screen is a bit tricky to text so I may get a stylus as I have fat fingers but other than that--so far so good and at a good price!
