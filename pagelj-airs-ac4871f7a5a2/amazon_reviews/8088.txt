Malfunction within 2 months, after the "month long" repair, it happened again!
I will not buy any product from Nikon in the future. I bought a Nikon J1 in mid of July, at end of Sep the Playback had a problem of zoom out. After zoom to 72 pictures frame, then zoom out to the next 54 pictures frame, it then got stucked & froze and could not zoom out anyfurther. In another words, the camera get stuck, it could no longer review any pictures. When it forze at 54 picture frame, about 45 picutres were block out and appeared in gray color, etc. I sent the camera at end of Sep to Nikon's Melville NY repaire center and it took about 1 month to get it back. Within 2 week after it came back, the same problem happened again. The real problenm for me is Nikon refuses to have it replaced after I called to compalin and I was told even I have the "warranty" Nikon is "only willing" to take another look but not replacement. So why should the customer get stucked with their defect product so what is the warranty for? Once your $ in their pocket then you don't count.
