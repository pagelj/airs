I bought this washer for my toddler's clothes only (we have big washer and dryer at home). It's very easy to operate but the only thing I don't like is we need to find the connector between the washer and the sink faucet. My husband looked around hardware stores several times and couldn't find. So the washer sat in our garage for a week before we finally had to use one portion of rubber hose as a kind of flexible connector.
