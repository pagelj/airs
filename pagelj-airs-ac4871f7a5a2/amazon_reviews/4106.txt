I wish I could give this book higher than five stars
I am a grown adult and it is almost embarrassing how I started reading this novel.  I was waiting for my then twelve year old to leave her tutoring session and there was a crate of books for the middle school students to choose from to read.  This novel was on the very top and I grabbed it in an effort to merely pass the time. From the very first page of the paperback novel I was hooked.  To the point where I made my daughter wait for me so I could write the author's name and the title of this book down.  That very night I purchased this story on kindle and I loved it. In fact, I have re-read it more than once.  I for one, enjoyed the dialogue between the children, I was thrilled by the mock-fight scenes, I felt for Ender when he was being bullied and harassed by the school staff and felt the sadness he described when he was trying to re-connect with his sister.  To be honest though, I was not always engaged in the sections that described what was going on back at earth between his older brother and his sister.  I hear that there is going to be a movie adaptation of this story and I am very excited to see it.  I know the children in this story are young but that did not take anything away from the story for me - I believe some children are capable of great things when they are given no choice.
