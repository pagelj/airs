The Atlantis gene
This book was smart-i loved it!! I read 3 to 4 books per week and hardly ever find a 5 star review in them!-but I loved this book-it was exciting and required you to use your brain. Definitely a thrill with every chapter that kept me turning the pages until the cliff hanging end! Completely surprised this is the author's first novel but bravo for AG! Not many nail a slam dunk novel on their first try! Can't Waite for next book in the series-i don't think this author will disappoint!! Thanks AG, keep up the good work!
