Happy & Sweet
I really enjoyed reading this book. I loved the characters and their experiences. The daughter was the perfect addition for this couple and definitely a matchmaker. :) The ending was perfect too. Hot, sweet, simple, and romantic - in a sense. -Squeak!- This book definitely left me with a smile on my face. By the time I actually got to the last sentence my face felt like it was going to be stuck from smiling so hard from that last scene. (In a happy way, not a ha-ha way) There were great steamy scenes, some fun, understanding, and coming to terms with yourself. Plus a little, 'seeing the light'. I wouldn't mind reading this again and it's definitely 'on the fence' for earning a spot on the bookshelf. Enjoy!
