Fun read; could have been more
This book passed the most basic "worth picking up?" litmus test: I enjoyed reading it. It was fun, I always wanted to keep reading, and there were many interesting and imaginative things therein. (There were also a few moments that made me laugh out loud; generally a plus.)That being said, it was a fairly one-dimensional sort of enjoyment - almost entirely "hey, neat setting!", and interesting events springing from that neat setting. But the characters didn't really grab me, and didn't feel very deep - especially for people who'd lived 75 years! Equally disappointing was the minimal exploration (on a psychological / sociological level, not an aches-and-pains level) of that 75-year age - one of the core things which fundamentally separates the premise from, say, Starship Troopers or other sci-fi war novels, not to mention the source of the title for the book. Overall: I'm not sorry I picked up this book, but I am glad I waited for paperback.
