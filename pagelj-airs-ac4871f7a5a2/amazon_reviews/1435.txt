Excellent camera!
The movie option is worth it and the 24MP sensor amazing. I filmed a plane at cruise altitude (6 miles/10km up) and managed to zoom it so much that I recognized the actual airline with very little loss of definition. Also took many photos of stars, since one can film for 30seconds without creating star trails. Color definition is excellent. Amazing value for money.
