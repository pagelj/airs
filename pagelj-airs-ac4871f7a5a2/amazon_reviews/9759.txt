Great with a little help from the internet!
The actual product is great.  However, there was no video link with mine. And the instructions were obviously written by somebody who does not speak the English language. There are great video tutorials on the web though.  I would watch a couple before trying to do this.  I am certainly not a wiz at "do it yourself" repair projects.  I did this one by myself and it was simple enough.  If I can do it, you can do it.  Separating the glass from the metal frame was tedious, but not horrible.  Use a blow dryer to heat it up a little at a time.  Makes the glass easier to pull off.  Getting it started is the hard part.  When you put the new glass on make sure the ribbon cables are on the inside of the frame.  (IMPORTANT!!!)Again, if I can do it, you can do it!
