Decent transformer
We purchased 5 of these for our move to Sweden 6 months ago and all are still working.  Three are used on a continuous basis for clock radio/CD players while the other two are used occasionally for chargers and other things that aren't universal.  The transformers get a little warm but not enough to be an issue.  The devices we use on this transformer are only about 30 watts so I can't say how it will perform when you get closer to 200W. Just to be safe, I purchased transformers that were more than double of what I needed. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the transformers aren't properly grounded even though there is a hole for grounded prong on the output.  It would have been pretty simple to add proper grounding so it doesn't make sense to me that they didn't do it. Overall, they do what they are supposed to do and were relatively inexpensive.----Update: All transformers are still working after two years.
