Ok, seriously. I was super psyched to get this. Well, as psyched as you can be about a garbage can. I haven't used it yet but I am already appalled that is doesn't come with an AC adapter! After spending all the cash for this, you have to buy that separately. You've got to be kidding. For that reason alone. I've given this three stars. Oh, yeah, and I called customer service who tells me if you don't by the adapter made by the company you void the warranty. When I asked well how many volts should the adapter be, there was a lot of hesitation and an unsure reply. I just revised this item bringing it down to two stars. Within one year the sensor stopped work to open the lid and other than using your hands there is no other way to open this thing. Btw, my sister bought the same one and you guessed it, the same thing happened to hers within the year.
