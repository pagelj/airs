Love it!
I have this cover in pink and I love it!  It's slim, sturdy, functional, and pretty all at once.  I bought it awhile ago when I first bought the Kindle Fire - when it first came out - but was prompted to write my review today when I was looking for the perfect cover for my new iPad (I like gadgets) and kept saying to myself if only I could find one like the awesome cover for my Kindle!  So I looked at the Kindle cover closely and discovered it was the CEO Hybrid from Marware.  Went to their website and ordered the same thing for my iPad (not available on Amazon yet).  YAY!! Get this cover you won't be sorry!
