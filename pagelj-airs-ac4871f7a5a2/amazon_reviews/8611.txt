It works but.....
First I picked this up on Black Friday.  The price was too good to pass up! The good: It arrived on schedule with no damage in shipping and powered up as expected.  Unfortunately, not something every laptop I own has done that out of the box. The bad:  I didn't anticipate the huge learning curve that would be required to go from Win 7 to Win 8!  Having gone from XP to visa to win7 was childs play.  With win 8 I'm challenged, been trying to familarize myself but this is going to take time I really didn't want to spend learning a completely new (to me) process. Overall its an okay laptop and I'll keep it. But if you buy it, make sure you're ready to take the time to learn win 8 its not as user friendly as previous versions of windows and there's no way to downgrade the install version of win 8 back to win 7.  Buyer beware.
