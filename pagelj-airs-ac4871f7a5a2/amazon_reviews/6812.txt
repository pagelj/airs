Way better than the really cheap ones.
I purchased these after using the 6 for $1.50 versions on eBay. The cheap ones that I used to buy would develop fuzzy worn areas in the high use parts of my screen (far right and bottom) after about a month. They also tended to scratch easily. These are a lot more durable. I've had one on my phone for about a month, and it is crystal clear. I recently put my phone in the same pocket with my keys, and I only have one very tiny nick. That would have annihilated the cheap ones that I used to use. They also fit better in the sense that they lay flat around the camera phone speaker cutouts. The cheap ones would always lift up in one area or another around the cutouts. Over all, they are worth the extra money.
