Works on iMacs
Just got this product because my imac superdrive is super unreliable. It's true that you only need to plug in one cord for this to work, but it has to be the main cord. The secondary cord that you apparently need to plug is as well with PCs will not work alone on my mac, my computer only recognized the device when I switched it to the more direct cord. Something else I noticed, after burning a cd with itunes, it will only eject if you click the eject in itunes, the button on the device did not open the drive for me. Still, I'm happy with this purchase so far.
