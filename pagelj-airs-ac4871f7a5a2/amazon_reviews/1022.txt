BOOOMMM!!!!
R. I. P. Dell Otiplex GX280 with LCD Flat Panel Monitor!!!  Well, truthfully.... the monitor still works.  Speakers are marginal, but functional.  As for the computer's brain "BBBBOOOOOMMMM"!  One day it just starting sounding like a jet plane engine and conked off with a sign off of a puff of smoke and silence.  Huh.  Silence truly is golden.
