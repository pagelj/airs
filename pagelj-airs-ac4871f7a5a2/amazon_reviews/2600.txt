Has great story development and build a universe that is highly believable especially if you think about the trending dependency of welfare.  An action novelette that builds the story in a progression that keeps you wondering where this is all leading.  Of course it has the guy chases girl, guy saves girl, guy gets girl in the end, but hey it gives you something to root for.  A good fast read that opens the door on a new Sci-Fi universe and leaves you wanting more.
