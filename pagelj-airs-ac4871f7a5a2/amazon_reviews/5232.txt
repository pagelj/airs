Exceeds my expectations
This camera does everything I've wanted my camera to do.  Having the f2.8 aperture opening through the entire zoom range of 25mm-600mm is the feature that prompted me to BUY this camera + the overall favorable consensus of reviews here on amazon. comPrimarily I shoot RAW RW2 photo files, Aperture Priority, Manual Focus, ISO @100 & use an IMAC to view my photos.  APERTURE is my photo editing Application.  I use the eye level viewfinder almost exclusively.  Here in Arizona there is so much light it is difficult to see anything in the LCD viewer during daylight hours. I only wish it had two additional features that allowed a person to add a 5 second recording to the photo file at the time the photo has just been taken AND I wish the camera logged the GPS co ordinates as part of the exif informationI'll be surprised IF these two features aren't included in the FZ200 successor
