Best Value Computer
For a computer that cost $450, this computer is extremely worth the money. I'm using the computer for mostly web browsing and spreadsheets and it is very fast. I think getting a core i5 laptop for under $500 is rare and I would advise taking the opportunity if you are in the market for a new laptop.
