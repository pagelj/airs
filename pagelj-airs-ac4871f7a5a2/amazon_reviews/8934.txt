A weak and Faulty Laptop
I got this laptop for school assignment and some entertainment purpose. After three months of using the laptop,its start crashing repeatedly. The laptop would not start unless i m the safe mode. I had to pay $70 to repair it for the laptop to start normally. i will not recommend this to anyone that need a strong, reliable laptop.
