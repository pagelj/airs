Not yet sure, but will give another update
I posted this on questions, but thought I would post this as well.  I think Amazon should know as well."Hey anyone out there buy this 9200 Nikon Coolpix? Full HD 1080p/black? Well I had some issues with uploading and could see them on the NXr2 but they would not upload to computer, snapfish, windows or otherwise. So I called customer service they said I could only use certain SD cards brand names about 4 of them. They suggested I take them to some place like Walmart to get them uploaded. ? Wow, Really? I have never in my life had a problem like this before. Any suggests out there? Ok, I went to Nikon. com and this is the link I have for that... So, in order to save anyone else any grief, and as suggested on the Amazon site to buy Transcend SD card... it will not work, I have spent several unnecessary hours trying to figure this all out, because you will not get your pictures uploaded otherwise, Crazy, Yes, this is what I thought.. http://support. nikonusa. com/app/answers/detail/a_id/17756/~/approved-memory-cards---coolpix-s9300-%2F-s9200
