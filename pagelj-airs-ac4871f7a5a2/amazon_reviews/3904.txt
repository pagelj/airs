Can't really complain about anything.
I have been using the phone for a couple of weeks. I have the pebble blue version with 16 gb of built in memory.  The finish looks great, but when you pop of the back you can see it is just a cheap piece of plastic. The back cover comes off easily and the battery is easily accessible. Everything on the phone is plastic and all the edges are rounded.  I am not sure how you could dock this into anything since there are no flat edges like the iphone 4. The buttons on the sides work well but I am constantly pressing them by accident. I recently installed a bumper case so this doesn't happen anymore. The external speakers (one on front and one on back) have good power, but since the one on the back faces away from you its not the best place to put it. The screen is nice and big, but the phone is very thin and light. I have no problem fitting it in my pocket. All of the software seems to run fast on it.  Youtube videos are flawless, and when you rotate the phone into landscape the video takes you the whole screen. I have also copied a WMV video from my desktop and that also played well. There is an LED light on the front that lights up when you get a voice message, email or text and I like that feature a lot. The headphones that come with it are good.  I have big ears and it still seals well. There are buttons on the cord that allow you to change the volume and I think there is also a built in mic but a haven't tried to use it yet. I havent' used the camera so I can't say how good it is. Call quality is very good. Battery life seems ok if you only turn on the LTE when you need it.  If you leave LTE on all day it chews up the battery. It does take a few hours to charge the battery so I try not to let the battery drain all the way down.
