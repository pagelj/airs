Freezes up out of the box
I bought this brand new with the 64gb ultra sandisk micro sd card. It freezes immediately out of the box. Now I have to go through the trouble of returning it and hopefully I can return my memory card too even though I had to open the memory card packaging in order to test the camera. The latest technology always has bugs. Always buy the second to the latest to be sure all of the problems are fixed.
