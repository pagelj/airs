i really love this phone
i love this phone. i thought i wouldnt be happier with anything else but my droid bionic (contract phone) but when i received my droid x i was surprised. it is just like my bionic minus the front camera. it takes excellent pics. the shipping was fast. i had no problems calling up verizon for set up of my new phone. i am very pleased with my buying results. i highly recommend this purchase all the way around.
