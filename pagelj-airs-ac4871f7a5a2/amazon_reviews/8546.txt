My chemical romance
three cheers for sweet revenge is one of those albums that you wont hang on to, it gets boring fast. All the songs sound simuler and the lirics are used time and time again. The first time you listen to it it sounds O. K, but then it starts getting worse and worse. By the time you listen to it the fouth or fith time it is old! I haven't heard their ather albums so I wouldn't know if they are getting worse or a bit bitter each time. One or two of their songs are enjoying a couple of times but if I were you i would down load the songs instead of buying the entire album.
