just okay and annoying that you can't replace the batteries
I was pretty disappointed in this toy. It was an okay toy, and our daughter liked to play with it. But the animals would get stuck after only using it for a short time. Now, two years later the batteries are dead and when I wanted to replace them for our younger daughter I realized it's those little watch batteries. Buying the required three of them would be like $12. That would obviously be more than a new phone. Now I have to buy a new one but I will make sure to buy a different one that takes regular batteries.
