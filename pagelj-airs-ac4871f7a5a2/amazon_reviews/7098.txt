Found a keeper and LOVE it!!
I finally found a keeper S100 in "champagne silver" and love it.  I tried at least 3 (three) S100's and the annoying clicking sound in the video was driving me crazy.  I called Canon tech support who said they were unaware of any video clicking issues (NOT)!!  They had me turn off the IS as well as other things and the clicking was still there.  They simply said "well it's a small camera so that's to be expected).  My Elph 300HS and SX230 are small, too but there's no clicking sound during the video playback. It's really worth your while if you have to try a few to find one you like.  I am still a Canon fan when it comes to point and shoot digital cameras.... now if I could only find an SX260 without that annoying squeal, then I'll be even more happy!! Good luck out there Canon fans!!
