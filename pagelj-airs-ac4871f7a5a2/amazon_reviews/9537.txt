Best Quality BEst VALUE!!!
When I bought a samsung Led hd 3d tv here in amazon I made sure I got an Hdmi for the best picture... I was debating to get the monster cables best buy has but decided to try this one instead. I bought 2 of these and My husband and I were so amazed of the clarity it provides... You can compare this with the expensive cables they sell in bestbuy. I have one from best buy and there is no difference.. It is gold plated and is just the perfect length.. I hooked up our ps3, on the other one we got. Its a must buy for every tv purchase in amazon... It shipped free with my purchase but I recieved it separately from the tv.
