Sony DVD player
Bought two of these and had to return one immediately as after 20 minutes it simply stopped (playing different DVD's each time) and the screen went black, the remote and physically pressing buttons on the player did nothing.  This happened four straight times.  Amazon easily took it back (UPS showed up with a return label in hand), and now awaiting my replacement.  The second one we bought has frozen a couple times, but it restarts by itself in about 10 seconds... but have to try other DVDs in there to make sure it's not the DVD we're watching.  Just have to find the time to run the experiment.  Quite surprised a Sony product feels so light, and dare I say, cheap.  I almost don't want to press the buttons on the player too hard, and the remote is as heavy as a feather.  Surprising since the reviews were glowing for this model.  We shall see...
