Great Camera
I find that for the price, this a fantastic camera. Pros - "Easy auto mode" chooses the mode for the best picture and works great most of the time. Good color accuracy when in light. Like 10 seconds from button press to shoot (not bad but not great). Great and smooth video especially good for things like youtube and whatnot. Easy transfer from camera to computer; connect with required cable and then just drag and drop. Cons - It has a hard time getting color correctness on close up shots (especially dark close up shots) and it's a PAIN to take a picture of something more than half a foot in front of you because it REALLY doesn't like to focus in close-up shots. It is possible to take close up shots with good color with this camera but it takes several tries and messing with exposure settings (pretty easy to do but it would be nice if it was automatic). Sometimes it has some trouble using drag and drop and the transfer freezes halfway through and you have to cancel and start the transfer again. It happens randomly but it's just a minor inconvenience. But for like 70 bucks, it's FANTASTIC for your money. I got mine for Christmas and for the hobby photographer or family picture-taker, it's well worth the money.
