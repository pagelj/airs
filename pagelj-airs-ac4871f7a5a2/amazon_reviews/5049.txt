Bring the screen to Life
My tech-wise son advised this product - the logitech webcam C310 - so we could Skype with him and our grand-daughter.  The former webcam that we had was giving us fuzzy pictures.  All of a sudden, when we connected with the new webcam, it seemed like the screen came to Life, and we felt like we were right there in the living room with our son and grand-daughter.  It was such a "True to Life Image."
