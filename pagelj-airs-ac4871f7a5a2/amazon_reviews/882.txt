Which is worse? This player or Sony Support?
I hooked up this player last night and got an orange screen - which should be blue. I played a DVD and the colors were, or course, wrong, so I fiddled around with the settings and got the colors to be wrong differently. I read the manual, checked the Sony support Web site and Googled key words. Nothing. I went to the Sony support Web site, where this player is NOT listed (only Blu-ray players are) and sent an email off to the Blu-ray folks, asking which setting to tweak.  I got an automated response. I just called Sony support. The tech (as usual) had me troubleshoot from a script that had NOTHING to do with my problem. And, when none of that stuff worked (surprise!), so wanted me to re-configure the rest of my set-up, which I refused to do, since everything was working fine before my last player died. She then wanted me to plug something else in - I don't own anything else to plug in - because "there's no setting you can adjust to fix this."As clueless as support was, the fact that the phone kept cutting out, for 10 or 15 second intervals, making the whole thing impossible. The tech could hear me saying 1.2.3.4... and then I could hear her for one or two words and off we went again with me saying 1.2.3.4 until the call dropped. I haven't thrown out the packaging so I will return  this player and buy something made by another company because, unfortunately, this is not my first bad experience with Sony support. Not that other company's are much better...
