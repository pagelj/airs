Works Well on my computer
If you need a CD and DVD burner (and player) for your computer, this Amazon Basics DVD/CD external drive could be the perfect solution for you. It is "plug and play."The instructions are:Open package (easy with the frustration free packaging)Take out USB cord and WriterPlug cord into Writer. Plug other end into computer. That's it - your computer automatically installs the necessary driver, and immediately recognizes the writer. I tested it on my laptop, using Vista 64. Since I already have a CD/DVD burner/Reader on my computer, I wasn't sure what would happen. What I discovered was that once the external one was plugged in and installed my computer gave me the choice of which drive I wanted to use to burn my CDs. It coordinated well with i-tunes and played music and DVDs well with no hesitation. The only feature I noticed was a problem was that if your computer does not have enough USB power to operate the drive, you need to use the second USB plug (included on the single cord) to add power, or purchase an external plug. Since my computer has USB ports one on each side, I am grateful that it was able to run on only one USB plug! Still, it was very nice and very convenient, not to mention a good price, so I gave it four stars. On the other hand, it comes with a software called "Nero 9 Essentials." I could find nothing in this software that was not already available inside of windows (Windows Movie Maker and Windows DVD maker) or available free online. It is a free software that requires you to upgrade for any major features, so you will likely want to save your time and not install it.
