Nothing but good things to say.
Surprisingly fast shipment, phone worked flawlessly, all the accessories where there and worked as they should. I had to return it not because there was anything wrong with the phone, I wasn't aware that International versions of phones doesn't really work well with US carriers because the bandwidth they use is different as the rest of the world. I contacted them and explained why I had to return it and in 5-10 mins they approved me to return it. Even issuing the refund was pretty fast and without any issue. I wouldn't hesitate if I had to buy from this company again, really professional and responsible.
