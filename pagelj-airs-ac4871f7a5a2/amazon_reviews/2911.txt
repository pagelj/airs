Missing zippered pocket
I bought this case for my fugifilm finepix Ax digital camera.  The case fits this camera perfectly.  My camera dimension is 2 3/8 inches height, 3 3/4 inches wide & 1 1/8 inches depth (max).  The case is well constructed and the enclosing zipper goes along 2 sides of the case. What really disappointed me was that the advertised zippered pocket for memory cards was missing.  My case just has a pleat where the pocket and zipper should have been.  The description needs to be updated because it is wrong.
