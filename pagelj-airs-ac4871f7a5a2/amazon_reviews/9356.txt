Cool to touch - Toasts great  - Keep muffins warm...
Besides the obvious that you have a choice in colors... (I bought the red one, it is a dark orange / red color, gives a great pop in the kitchen)... the design is great. it automatically adjust to the width of the bread slice you put in, you can do thick sandwiches, bagels, normal toast. Works all good,  you can set the temperature and I love the defrost button. Out the freezer, in the toaster, set your temperature push the lever down and hit defrost. It defrosts it for you and then toast it. Nice! Got a bread crumb tray as well. There is also a little build in tray to keep your muffins warm on top of it. Outside stays cool in use.
