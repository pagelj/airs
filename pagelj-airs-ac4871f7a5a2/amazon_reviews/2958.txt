A truly fantastic tale
It's been a while since I read a book that made me want to come home from work, skip the gym and just sit and read. The story told is well written, the characters are believable and likeable.  They develop well, behave like you'd expect them too and basically they just work. As a story goes, of course you have to suspect reality a little bit.  In the end the protagonist goes a little Rambo and never seems to tire or run out of energy.  But even that is a minor bump in the road. The story is so well told that for at least the first half of his heroic acts you can see him just running on pure adrenaline. But beyond the story itself I have to comment on the writing.  It's very well done and very well edited.  In today's eBook craze I've read some books with atrocious spelling errors, wrong word forms, incomplete sentences... one even appeared to just sort of stop in the middle of a paragraph and take you to a whole new plot line.  With this book I saw no glaring spelling errors, only a few improper word forms and none of the rest.  (Ok, maybe 1 sentence that had obviously been written, then edited but not proof read.)All in all, I have to give it 5 stars.  It was compelling, fun, believable (as much as military space based sci-fi is anyway) and quite well polished.  Read the sample and take it from there.  What you read there is a great representation of the remainder of the book.  One thing though: the sample skips a bit... I'd say it's basically chapters 1 and part of 3.  If you buy the book you'll want to go back and read chapter 2.
