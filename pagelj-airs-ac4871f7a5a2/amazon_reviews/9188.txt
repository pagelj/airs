Granted this is not the same quality of machine that Starbuck's uses however for the price and the ease of use, I am extremely happy with it.  I haven't used the frothing feature yet but brewing espresso is no more difficult than brewing a regular cup of coffee.  I believe pricier models have the ability to have the clock set and preprogrammed brew times but 4 cups of espresso brew in less than 5 minutes with this.
