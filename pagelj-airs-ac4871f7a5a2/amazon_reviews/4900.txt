LG 800G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone)
I received the product in a timely fashion. It worked and was exactly as the picture showed. I was satisfied with the purchase. However, DO NOT expect it to work like a smart phone or you will be very unhappy. I am a man with man fingers and find it hard to txt without bumping the wrong keypad button. Moving screens is sluggish. You get what you pay for and for the price it's an OK phone. Be sure to put a piece of clear shield on the screen to protect it from scratches," it will get scratched if you don't". You will most likely have to cut a piece to fit yourself as I did cause no one makes a custom piece for that phone.
