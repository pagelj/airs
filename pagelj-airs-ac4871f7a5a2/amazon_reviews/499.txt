An exciting adventure story
When I first heard about this book, I thought that it would be most great if I had been an bigtime gamer in the 80's.  While I did grow up in the 80's and played some video games, I didn't consider myself a gamer.  My expectations were wrong.  Anyone can find this story engaging and exciting as long as they can except the premise that people of the future spend a great deal of time in a virtual world.  Everything else is simply an adventure of good against evil and David vs Goliath.  I highly recommend this book!
