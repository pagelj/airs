Returned it.. Defeats purpose of blue tooth
I had bought this for my iphone 5 to hold my phone while listening to itunes through my separate bluetooth device. Sometimes when you are driving through town or into different areas farther than usual, the radio station will need to be changed on the adapter as well as the car. The placement of this cell phone holder blocks the cars radio tuner display, therefore in order to see the channel, the entire holder must be removed from the CD player which can be annoying and unsafe if trying to do while driving. If you are looking for a simple holder for your phone, this is a nice phone holder. However, if you are trying to use a separate bluetooth device with your phone, I would recommend purchasing a holder that clips to a vent, and does not block the tuner display.
