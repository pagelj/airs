Eh
My new Blu Ray player came with most all the same options through wifi and the format of netflix and amazon prime is so much better on the bluray I wish I had not purchased Roku. I am just going to put it with a tv we use less often. The roku also states every few days there is a problem with the netflix account as perhaps I might need to update billing. I dont. A reset of the wholesystem is the only fix. Not a good product.
