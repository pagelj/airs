A classic sci fi book that appeals to the every day reader
Ender's Game is the one sci fi book I can hand to anyone and know they will love. The book combines many story elements and themes to develop a complicated young boy who faces the worlds challenges. It is a fun fast read, that I love to pick up and read again and again. As you learn more about ender and the other characters in the ender-verse you can more deeply appreciate the boys losses and wins and the emotions he goes through while getting there.
