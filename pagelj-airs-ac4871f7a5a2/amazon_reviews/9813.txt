Very nice product
I got exactly what I purchased. I was very nervous about buying it at first because the price seemed too good to be true, and my main worry was that the screen wouldn't be as high-res as the original. After receiving it and installing it, I can assure you that it is just the same. However, you should keep the home button and speaker mesh and install them onto your new screen because they do not come with this. The tool kit includes a pentalobe, a phillips, and a flat head screwdriver. The phillips screwdriver seemed to be too large for a lot of the screws inside though, so I purchased a precision screwdriver set from Walmart. The customer service was great, and I am very happy with my purchase.
