A critical part of our baby equipment. We don't leave the house without it!!
This is really a must-have. We bought it because we wanted our baby child to sleep on his own bedroom, and this monitor has been crucial in our success. We can sleep or be with friends and keep an eye on him at all times. The night camera works perfectly even in complete absence of light and the sound sensitivity is great. Most important of all, the reception is really really good, it works perfect even in big or multiple story houses. If you have reception issues, just don't forget to lift the antenna :DThe only drawback is that the base station can only work with the AC-adapter an has no option for batteries, but being honest, is not much of a problem. The receiver unit has a great battery life, providing that you don't keep the screen on at all times. With the screen is always on the battery life lasts about 3 hours. If you leave it to automatically turn off, and turn the screen on only when you want to see what's going on, then the battery can last easily the whole night or even more. Note that if the screen is off, the receiver is still working and you can still hear the sound from the baby's room.
