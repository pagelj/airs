Intuitive & easy to use
Operation is intuitive and the recorder is very easy to use.  It seems to be full featured and taking advantage of all features would likely some reading of the manual.  However, for simple note taking or recording meetings (my only uses to date), I was able to start right up.  Sound quality and pick up seem good to me.  An advantage is its small size:  very easy to carry and light weight.  A disadvantage is its small size:  easily misplaced and I can't read the screen without my glasses.  Since you can't have one without the other, I prefer the small size.  For frequent travelers, size and weight are important.  I just keep my glasses handy.  Overall, I am very pleased and would buy another, if this one got damaged (although it appears very sturdy) or lost.
