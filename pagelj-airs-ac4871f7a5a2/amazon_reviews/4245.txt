I will not give this product any stars because I haven't tried it out (only 1 because it's mandatory). The main problem is that the adapter needed to convert the EU electricity (220 V) to US electricity (120 V) "is more expensive that the toaster itself" and it would generates a lot of heat due to it's big size (experts told me, and mentioned that the price would be about 450 USD). I first noted this after buying it and receiving it (the product was sent really fast from Amazon though). So I will only let other people know of my mistake so they don't do the same :(p. s.: I wish they made a toaster like this for the EU
