Headache.. spoiler alert
I love reading.. I can curl up with a book and finish it in one day.. even though I've read thousands of books I have yet to rate one... until now. Where do I start.. well for one I am all for steamy hot love scenes but this book goes waaaay overboard... I found myself skipping through these scenes just so I do not have to read the same descriptive words over and over. Another aspect of this book.. that continued to frustrate me was how weak the main character was portrayed to be. I mean come on... how can one continually date a person and know NOTHING about them.. due to the fact that you are uncertain if you should ask. I finished the book because I paid for it but I will not be ordering any of the others.. please take it from a fellow book lover and do not waste your money.. unless you fancy being lead in circles.. never getting anywhere
