High Quality, Great Price
Very nice solid blade, comfortable weight with a nicely textured handle for grip.  I bought this to replace a nice Henckel paring knife that had been broken by a collision between a pugnacious pumpkin and an exuberant child.  I don't see such misfortune happening with this more solid knife!  It feels and performs better than the Henckel we had.
