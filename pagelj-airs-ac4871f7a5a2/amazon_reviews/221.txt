Another great camera from Nikon
I have had a Nikon Coolpix S600 for 5-6 years now and it has been my go to camera to have around because of it's handy size and it has never let me down, except that recently the zoom function is intermittently working.  So, I decided to replace it with the S9500 and just got it this past week and really wanted to put it through the paces a bit to see how functional it would be around town and in the field. The wi-if transfer is really handy when your out and about and want to transfer photos to a cell phone or tablet that has data capability so they can be uploaded to a website or to just back them up on another device.  I used my iPad and the free app from Nikon called Wireless Mobile Utility (WMU) which can be found in the App Store, it's really quick and easy to use. It also allows you to setup your camera and remotely take pictures with the app, I found that I could only be about 30 feet away from the camera with my iPad before the wi-if signal was lost so it has range limitations. The 22x zoom is fantastic for this size of a camera, it takes really nice clear photos even zoomed all the way out.  The anti vibration works well also if you al moving about and taking action shots. One big complaint I have so far is the placement of the record button for starting video recording.  I have hit this button numerous times on accident and there is no way to disable the video record function, it's always at the ready when you are in photo mode.
