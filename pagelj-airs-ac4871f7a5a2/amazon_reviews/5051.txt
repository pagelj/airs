Since I am not a professional chef, I was not looking for a top of the line Henckels set. I wanted a set that was functional,good looking and reasonably priced. This 17 piece set fit the bill nicely. I have read some of the other reviews which mention rusting and dullness. I have not encountered any of these problems. It is true that any quality steel will rust if water is left on it,but with care the knives will not rust. They remain sharp as the day I got them and I use them frequently. One note though, they really are not diswasher safe but just as I would not put my Lenox china in the diswasher, I would not subject any quality cutlery to the brutality of the diswasher. If you are a "Family Chef" like me, buy this set.
