Falls off when the sun sets
I have a black BMW 3 Series, and I've noticed that the normally very sticky and grippy suction cup just can't hold up to a hot, sunny day, followed by a cool evening. I've returned to my car numerous times to find it upside down near the shifter or on one of the seats. My workaround is to collapse the unit down but leave it in place. This way, if it loses suction, it at least won't fall off. I'm not sure if it's the texture of hardness of the dash material or just the temperature extremes that causes the problem, but at least for me, this product only gets three stars. If it didn't have this major flaw, I would probably give it five stars. You can easily position your phone in landscape or portrait mode, and switch between the two easily. The mounting system also allows you to rotate your phone in seemingly every direction to get the perfect position. The price is also highly competitive. Even if you don't choose this particular product, if you use your phone for navigating while driving, you won't want to go back to putting your phone in the console/drink holder or, worse, holding it in your hand once you've tried mounting it. It makes a huge difference in ease of use and safety. So, the iOttie is a great product with one major flaw (at least for my car).
