Did I ever thank you for getting this for me?
That's what my husband says nearly everyday.  He has neurological problems with his hands and has trouble holding a book and turning the pages, but this is so easy for him.  The display is easy to use and downloading books is a snap so he's reading through the classics, Ben Hur, The Count of Monte Cristo, etc.  If he doesn't understand a word he just checks the dictionary included in the software.
