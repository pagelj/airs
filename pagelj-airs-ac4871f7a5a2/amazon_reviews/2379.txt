Quick and Easy
This was a great purchase. Pros:- The plates are lightweight- The plates are easy to clean - I haven't put in the dishwasher yet so I don't know about how well they stand up to heavy cleaning- The plates are easy to remove, attach, and switch around- Easy to use - from changing temperature to changing type (grill or griddle)- I haven't cooked anything in which would require the drip pan but I like the idea of it.- Non-stick surface of plates allows me to cook without using oil or butterCons:- Using as a panini press is a little difficult to get the top plate to adjust flat when closedI would recommend this product to others - I haven't experienced any problems such as not turning on that other reviewers have noted. UPDATE: 5/15/13- I used this for cooking bacon and sausage and it was so easy to clean both the machine itself and the drip pan.- I have also put the plates into the dishwasher and they look/seem no different than if I hand-washed them.- It is a little bit of work to get the machine to open up and become a full griddle.  This is not really an issue but I thought I would mention it.- We use this several times a week since our purchase and have found it to be awesome!  Easy to use and clean and much healthier than using the stove because we never add any butter or oil.
