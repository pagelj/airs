I AGREE IT'S A FINE CAMERA!
Purchased this camera to replace an old tried and true Olympus Stylus 300 that I used for my real estate business. Checked all the consumer reviews and decided on the Canon ELPH HS 110 due to its low light capabilities and large LCD screen.  While I am not a camera buff and will more than likely not use even a quarter of the features, I was  duly impressed by the clarity of the LCD screen and the ease of using the HD video.  As a guy with large hands the only down side for me is the rather small size of the camera which makes it difficult to hold.  I did find, however, that the use of the hand strap helped tremendously!  Probably the best feature for me will be the timer and tripod socket for taking photos of my really BIG FISH when no one is around! lol
