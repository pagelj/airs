No Complaints
I had just recieved this for my Canon Digital Rebel XTi Camera and it works great! Just screw it into the lens and you are set and ready to go! The price I found on this was $6.99 and does not change often if at all when I have checked... For that price it is absolutly great because it saves a lens thats worth $500
