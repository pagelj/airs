Still waiting for the Dance to start
Slow and hardly advances the story at all. With every other book in this series I raced through to the end. I started this one that way until I realized the book is apparently one giant prologue for... what? Like others have said in these reviews, we waited six years believing that this book would answer certain questions or at least advance certain story lines. It didn't do either. Mr. Martin better get his act together, quickly this time, and recover from this travesty with a better book because right now he is doing exactly what he says that he feared. He's on the verge of pulling a Lost.
