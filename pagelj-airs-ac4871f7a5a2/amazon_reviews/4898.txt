I have just purchase my second Mr Coffee Espresso Maker! Recently, my old Mr Coffee machine was passing more water down into the drip tray then through the coffee brew basket. I tore apart the machine and discovered a defective solenoid. Thinking that a year and a half of service was poor, I purchased a DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Machine. De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker Boy was THAT a mistake. It has a separate water frothing steam tank adjusted by a knob on its top. But when I tried making frothed up milk like I always do, I ended up with watered down milk! Its totally steam driven unlike this Mr Coffee Espresso maker which is pump driven like the espresso function. The DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Machine has a very short steam stem making it difficult to get a pitcher under with any ease. Its nozzle at the end is plastic and just doesn't fit the bill. And directly under the brew basket on the DeLonghi EC155, there is barely room for a shot size container. The fit of the metal drip tray cover is extremely poor. And finally, the Espresso product produced, is very close to each other. I would have to say that the DeLonghi Will produce more crema than does the Mr Coffee maker. So why did I comment more on the De'Longhi EC155 Espresso Machine then the MR Coffee, cause the Mr Coffee is Everything the De'Longhi is NOT. And it is in the same price range for home low price espresso makers. Summary:- Frothing function is Pump Driven and has a Metal Frothing tip.- There is ample room under the brew basket for good size espresso type cups.- The Drip tray can be removed to allow for a larger cup (DeLonghi s removes but leaves a front lip in the way)- The water reservoir for the Mr Coffee is larger.- The Warm-up period is less than a minute (DeLonghi 15 minutes! )- The brew basket and filters are easy to use almost fool proof (DeLonghi s have to be carefully assembled and attached to makerand need to be disassembled to clean - more plastic parts!!! )
