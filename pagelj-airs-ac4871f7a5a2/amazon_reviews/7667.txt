Got this a couple of months ago as per the CR recommendation. It works good on carpet, not so good on hard floors. For hard floors, the brush does not turn off and shoots the bigger junk around. But it works good on carpet, is pretty light, LOTS of power, a bag change indicator, and the attachments work well. Going to get another now! Make sure to get extra bags soon, they go fast.
