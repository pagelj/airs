Another great Miele product
Miele has a long reputation for quality. This machine is no exception, although now it's more affordable. This is the lightest Miele vacuum yet, at only 9.4 pounds. This is our second Miele canister. We still use the old one after 12 years, we just wanted a second one for the hard floors. We also own a Miele dishwasher and induction cooktop. I would recommend purchasing from a local dealer though, as there are many choices within the Miele line up, and you want to be sure you get the right product for your needs. That is much easier with a hands on demo.
