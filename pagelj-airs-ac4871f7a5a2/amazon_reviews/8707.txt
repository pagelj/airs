.... I'm so upset with this washer........ Warning buzzer keeps on beeping so I need to arrange the clothes inside washer and when the washing cycle ends, it turns out that all the clothes are still dripping wet.... Then I tried and tried to minimize clothes until there's only one shirt left but still there's always a buzzing error sound that spin cycle couldn't continue....
