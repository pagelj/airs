love roku, but do not get this one if you have single remote system
so, i love roku.  i own 3.  i use them all the time. i was really excited to get the roku 3 and be able to go back to a hard Ethernet link and to get the new search capabilities. alas, this product is useless if you have a universal remote.  i use control 4 to run my theater, and the remote for roku runs on an RF standard that no outside remotes will work with and the device has no control inputs for external devices. so, unless you want a second remote for nav, it's a non starter. i'm sending it back and sticking with rouku 2. this is a huge oversight for a product like this and is not communicated anywhere on the roku website. i have to believe that there are lots of other folks who would also like to be able to integrate this into their home entertainment system, a fact roku seemed to understand on the last model. if they come out with an IR version or one with an input for external control, i'd happily look at the rouk3 again, but until then, not worth the annoyance. oh, and man are their support people difficult to deal with.  even the supervisor spoke such poor english it was difficult to understand her.  they are just reading scripts and do not have any idea what the question you are asking actually means.  one question that should have taken 30 seconds to answer devolved into 15 minutes of tail chasing.
