Nice trash can.  Quality seems excellent and slow close feature of lid is nice touch.  Really does resist fingerprints.  Wasn't quite as big as expected.  Still on the larger size for a bathroom, which is where we use.  Needed new trash can with a lid to keep our 10 month old out.  Happy with purchase.
