My third Roku, still love them!
I bought this one for my dad who has a sluggish (768 kbps) DSL connection.  The initial software update took about 30 minutes to install which had me worried about how well the device would stream over such slow DSL.  I got it connected to his Wi-Fi and had him streaming Crackle and Hulu Plus within minutes.  He can't get cable where he lives and satellite is too expensive for his taste, so he's really enjoying this.  He doesn't like to use credit cards online so he seemed to really appreciate the fact he can buy a Hulu Plus 3-month gift card at the grocery store.
