Great Walkaround / All Purpose Lens
When I purchased this lens I had also considered purchasing the Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4; the Sigma was tempting because it is a faster lens, but when you compare the images of the two lenses side by side there is no comparison.  The Nikon just produced better quality images from the test shots I was able to do with both of them.  The Sigma seemed to have a lot of issues with chromatic aberration that the Nikon doesn't seem to have.  Wish I could afford the 24-70mm f2.8, but this is a great all purpose lens that can produce some fairly high quality images.  VR (actually VRII) works well on the lens, but there is no true replacement for a large aperture.  If your not crazy about shooting with flash, this lens is a little slow for indoor shooting without cranking up the ISO sensitivity.  Nothing a tripod and remote can't solve, but that's not always an option.  Besides just having a nice range, which is what makes it a nice all purpose, I like it as a walking around  city lens.  It has active distortion control and 16mm is great when dealing with the wide scale of cities.  It can produce a fairly high quality images across it's entire range, which was something I was concerned about when I was originally in the market.  I was worried about distortions at the extremes, but it seems to keep a pretty good handle on the issue.  This lens produces some really crisp shots with a nice amount of contrast, and it seems to maintain better color accuracy than some of my other lenses.  I havn't had it that long, so I haven't taken thousands of shots with it yet, but without jumping to a $1000+ lens... I considered holding out until I could afford the 24-70 f2.8... I haven't been able to find anything better.  Haven't regretted my purchase for even a second.
