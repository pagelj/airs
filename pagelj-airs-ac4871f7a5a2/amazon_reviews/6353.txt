Simply Amazing
This pack is everything a hunter could want.  The tray on the back will allow you to pack an animal out whilst still carrying all of your supplies.  (That is if you can handle humping out around 150lbs)  The frame is light and is adjustable to your individual needs.  The rifle holder is simple but seems like it would work.  When I'm hunting though I don't want my rifle in my pack I prefer it in my hands.  The interior of the bag is huge and has a million pockets for everything you could need.  I would definitely buy this thing again.
