Less Than Enthused
1. Condition of plastic wrap (several layers of packing tape around end) and foam packing (broken/loose pieces) indicated to me this was a refurb unit.2. Set up was easy, and recording/play back wasn't a problem.3. After recording 3 DVD's, unit started losing video during record session. Tried playing production DVD and video failed after about 30 minutes. Now have absolutely no video during either record or play.4. $89 paperweight.
