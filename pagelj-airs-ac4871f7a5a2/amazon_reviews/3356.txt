First Camera
For my senior project I was creating an online portfolio of my work in the form of a blog, and I really wanted visual enhancements.  I purchased this camera after months of research and price checking and seeking advice.  It is worth every penny that I paid for it and I love it.  It's super user friendly and it only took me about a day or so of use to really get the hang of using it.  I learned early on that purchasing rechargeable batteries is a must though!  It takes beautifully clear pictures, even from very far away.  I also love the weight of it, because when I was researching it, a lot of people mentioned that it was small for a camera that does what this one does, and I wanted it to be substantial.  The LCD screen is the best!  I would definitely recommend this camera for first-timers who are enthusiastic and who want great quality pictures.  I am now eagerly awaiting a tripod/case set in the mail!
