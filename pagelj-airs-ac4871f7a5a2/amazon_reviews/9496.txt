Unbelievable Performance and Features For The Price!
I just received this DVD player tonight after struggling with a crappy Panasonic S-58 I purchased locally based on a few enthusiastic, albeit ill-conceived, reviews I came across on Amazon and elsewhere.  I can't tell you how happy I am with this unit and the myriad ways in which it excels both my previous Phillips 3962 (rendered it useless due to a sticky rental from Netflix)and the previously mentioned Panasonic model (of sorry memory), but I'll make a feeble attempt by way of this brief review nonetheless:Image quality:  The Phillips wins hands down here, offering what appears to my eyes at least to provide a level of picture quality (out of the box with ZERO adjustments) comparable to high-end units commanding upwards of three times the price.  The Panasonic, in contradistinction, offered a level of image quality that I judged to be,at best, mediocre, or what a more discerning home theater electronics fancier would refer to as "terrible".  It would indeed be no exaggeration to describe the difference as dramatic and eye-catching.  The upscaling to 1080i of my Samsung LCD is simply phenomenal.  I can't even imagine how good the image would be with 1080P compatible TV models. Features:  This DVD player has every feature you need and even some features you don't need. For those of you with DIVx-laden flash drives, fear not, as this unit provides front connecting USB facilities that effortlessly transport the tech- savvy votary of cutting-edge home theater to DIVx heaven with the the simple plugging of a cord. Price:  Cheap and good.  This is true of so few things in life.  For all those currently vacillating between "cheap dvd players", I would advise you to not look a gift-horse in the mouth when considering this unit.  Don't even think twice before hitting the purchase button and certainly don't wast your time and tire your poor eyes "researching" any longer.  This is, unequivocally, the HOLY GRAIL of cheap DVD players.  So save yourself some time and money and just hit the purchase button. Accessories:  For all those here endlessly kvetching about the "flimsy" remote, I beg to differ.  The remote is actually very elegant and well constructed for a player in this price class.  You want to see a cheap remote?  Buy the Panasonic S-58 and be prepared to cringe as the dollar-store quality Chinese toy-like polyethylene plastic tenses and creaks helplessly under the pressure of your child's feeble grip.  In any event, this complaint amounts to nothing more than the most minor of quibbles considering the superlative features and quality of the player itself.  For my part, however, I stand by my judgement that the remote is just dandy. In closing, I would like to thank Phillips for manufacturing this superb product and for providing it to the public at such a modest cost.  In doing so, they are affording the non-enthusiast public a viewing experience whose value far outstrips the mere pittance for which it is exchanged, and which will only serve to further consolidate Phillips unshakable position as the  leader in home entertainment electronics for years to come. And, as always, Amazon. com is peerless in their prompt, worry-free delivery of new products. Both, therefore, win my unqualified and unreserved endorsement.  FIVE STARS!******************************************************************************************************************************UPDATE 11/2/11:  Still working great!  DivX files burned onto standard CD-R(!) discs look stunning! SECOND UPDATE:  Everything continues to work wonderfully as of 8/5/12! I have no clue what a few of the most recent reviewers are talking about in criticizing this unit's longevity.  Perhaps theirs had been unwittingly abused at some point or the product of a bad production run at the factory.  I suppose we'll never know.  But I can tell you for certain that, nearly two years on, I can't help but be astounded at the performance and versatility of this fine little player. On a good TV at moderate viewing distances, I have found that the image quality nearly rivals Blue-ray.  It's that good.  Take my advice and buy one while they're still available.
