Rugged, large enough, and plenty of storage compartments
I've had it out camping several times, now.  It's large enough to pack everything i take.  Plenty of pockets and expandable storage.  Zippers and stitches have survived some tough usage.  The only thing I'd like to see changed is a wider sleeping bag section.  The sleeping bag will fit but it's very tight and takes more muscle than should be necessary.
