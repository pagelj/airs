Perfect (sans lens paper)
This kit rocks!  Everything you need to clean your camera and keep it that way - I prefer having lens paper available as well, so I'd have given 5 stars if it were included.  In any case, best bang for your buck hands down.  Most people/businesses on amazon cell the cleaning pen alone for $4-$8!  This is a steal here at $9 for the whole lot!  Gonna buy a kit for my brother also who just got a camera this week.
