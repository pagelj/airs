Too harsh
Update - perhaps my last review was a bit harsh as to the delivery time - my vast experience with amazon. com has spoiled me because I'm use to getting orders within a few days - this order took 12 days which to me seemed a bit excessive but as I said I'm spoiled.  Shouldn't take two stars for my impatience.  This set is very classy and we are pleased with the purchase.
