Soooo good!
I had an Amazon credit and I needed a book to read, so I thought what the heck.  Imagine Fifty Shades and the Crossfire series with a stronger female lead.  It was steamy without being cheesy or rushing things too much with the characters.  Theres one scene while they are away on a trip... omg!  Crazy!  While you're waiting for the third book in the Crossfire Series, definitely pick up this book... you will not be disappointed!  There are 3 books in this series but you don't need to read them all.  There's no cliffhanger.  Each book is about a different guy in a group of 3 friends.
