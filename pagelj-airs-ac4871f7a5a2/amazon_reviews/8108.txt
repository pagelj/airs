It is a fantastic small oven, useful for almost all uses other than the Thanksgiving turkey.  It is a bit large for ordinary toasting purposes.  There are just two of us in the house.  We use it all the time for heating leftovers, baking bread, etc., but rarely for toast.  We don't yet know how it would work for that.  The quick settings are nice -- very useful.
