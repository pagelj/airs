Nice looking toaster and easy to use.  It toasts bread very evenly.  I'm not sure what the bagel button does, I used it on english muffins and it seemed to take longer to toast than without using the bagel button - either way it works well. The price was good. My negative is it's made in China!  I thought KitchenAid products were made in the USA. It doesn't say on the Amazon site or the KitchenAid site where it was made but it sure says it on the bottom of the toaster. I would have shopped more to find a made in the USA product if I had known.
