"leather"
This case is really cute and I love how it looks! But it is not leather. I wasn't really expecting a leather case for about $3 but they mislead you by saying it is. It is also peeling on the edges, which isn't that big of a deal because you can't tell. I wouldn't recommend this product. There are many other cases on amazon like this that have pockets for cards and are a much higher quality for a slightly higher price.
