All a bunch of lies
The product didn't come with anything it promised besides a the glass and a broken screwdriver. I was terribly upset and when I decided that it wasn't that big of a deal and fixed my screen, I eneded up with a non-responsive iphone. Now not only do i have to go pay to get this fixed by I also ended up spending more money since i payed for this product when it was like $20. This company is only out to get your money, and trust me it's not worth it. By it from some other company which will actually give what you ordered for or pay to get it fixed. Don't let this company ruin your iphone like it did mine.
