I've been using it now a month and it brews very well; of course, you must use good coffee. The built in filter makes a noticeable difference in taste and clarity. The cost of the filters is worth it to me. Pouring the water into the opening is tight but manageable if you make sure the top is fully open. I like a bold coffee, smooth and not acid-bitter. This maker satisfies my preferences.
