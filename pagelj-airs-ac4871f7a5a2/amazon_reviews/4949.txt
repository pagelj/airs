Works Great - Takes forever to recharge
Love the product, works very well and it'll recharge my iPad about 3 times before its completely drained. Seems to take forever to recharge the cell tho but I kinda expected that. NOTE: It only will charge one device at a time! I Tried to do two and it flips between the two devices.
