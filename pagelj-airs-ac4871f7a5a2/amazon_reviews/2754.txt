Keeps my toddler off my computer
We purchased this product after our child played with it at a friend's house and loved it. My husband and I both work in the IT industry and often have to work at home on our work computers. We purchased this Leaptop for our toddler who insisted that she work on our "puters" as well. This allows her to work on her own laptop which makes her proud to work like mommy & daddy. She stays entertained while we get work done. Scout the "puppy" hosts a wide range of learning activities from the alphabet to identifying animals and the sounds they make. It's easy to carry, even for her, so we can take it on our travels. Batteries seem to last a long time. The price can't be beat. We recommend this product.
