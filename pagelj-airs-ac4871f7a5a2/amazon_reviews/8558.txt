As described; no hassles.
The adapter is great; we had a two dvd player set, which came with only one car cord.  With this adapter, we can use one dvd player in one car, and another in our other car, without having to move the player around each time we drive somewhere.  Makes getting our toddler in and out of her car seat much less of a struggle, since she wants to watch her video of Elmo.
