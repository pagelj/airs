You won't regret this purchase!
I have NEVER taken the time to write a review before, but this item was just too good not to talk about.  I had it loaded and hooked up in about 15 minutes and had converted a 50 min. VHS exercise video to a DVD in about 1 hour.  It will take the length of the video plus extra time for burning.  I was ready to trash all of my exercise VHS tapes, but now I don't have to.  I've successfully converted several this afternoon.  I am SO glad I made the purchase!
