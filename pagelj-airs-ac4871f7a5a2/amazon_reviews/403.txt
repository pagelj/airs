Great player but poor WiFi capabilities and buggy
The actual playing of Blu Ray and up-conversion on normal DVDs is amazing. Great Quality, however, I also bought this player so I can watch Netflix and use the DLNA to connect to my phone. The streaming is very poor, I have a brand new Cisco router located only 15 feet away. The signal is not an issue, I can connect many laptops, smartphones and my Wii console without any issues. The Wii is situated next to the DVD player and it streams Netflix without any issues. The DVD player will constantly stop and sputter and try buffering again. I called LG tech support and reset the whole machine but that didn't make any difference and then they hung up on me! They didn't call back, great customer service, I'll never buy any LG product again! Additionally, every know and then it would lose my internet settings, however, if I turned off the player and switched back it on, it then remembered it. This player is buggy and many other customers have also had the same problem with the WiFi, Netflix, internet settings and poor customer service. I'm returning this back to Amazon and I'll try my luck with a Sony or Samsung.
