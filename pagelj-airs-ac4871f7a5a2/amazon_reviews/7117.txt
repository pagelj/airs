More difficult to apply than implied
It's a fine product, but I did find it a bit more difficult to apply than was implied by the description. The video is helpful, but if you don't get the application right the first time, forget it. It does not come off and re-apply well. Not really a huge deal because of the price, but didn't really work for me.
