panasonic lumix sz7
bought this camera because i have other Panasonic cameras and i like their operation. this camera is great if it had a viewfinder it would be greater, but you don't find viewfinders anymore. the zoom, the operation and buttons the screen and picture quality are great. as you can see i like this camera, i don't have to carry my fz35 anymore for a good picture. for the price you will not find a better camera
