The perfect Second book
This is the perfect second book in photography. I read an introduction to SLR and photography a couple years ago, and since then been looking for a little more tips and tricks into photography. This book is perfect for that. There's no introduction to shutter speeds and f-stops. Just tricks, what to do in various situations, what kind of equipment to use etc. His jokes are funny, keeps you interested in the book from start to finish. Overall, buy this book if you've already read any book about introduction to photography. Now a little about Volume 2: Don't set your expectations based on Volume 1. This was more of a disappointment than anything else. Basically, Vol 2 repeats a lot of things from Vol 1 (including the jokes!) and adds a few things about equipment and tricks. But mind you, the equipment gets more expensive as the volumes progress! Most of the equipment suggested in Vol 2 runs into a few 100s.
