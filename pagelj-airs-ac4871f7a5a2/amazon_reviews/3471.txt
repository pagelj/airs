So far so good
It's nice looking, but the case is very thin and easily deformable. Mine came with a raised corner where the  lights/button meet the rest of the case (see image). I don' expect a replacement would be any better. It's just cheaply done. Edit: My fault; it was just a clear, protective sticker. Oops, so I'm rating it 5 stars. Edits after test:I fully charged mine and am waiting three months before doing run down tests (in April 2013). I will update this review then with the amount of times it will charge my Galaxy S3.
