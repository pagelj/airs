Ok for the price
The tablet is ok for its price but I've had better. The screen was difficult to use at times . I had to click on things over and over for it to respond. If your looking for something to give to a kid (gave my niece this tablet after I got a new one)  or if you want something cheap and don't really care about extra things then this is for you
