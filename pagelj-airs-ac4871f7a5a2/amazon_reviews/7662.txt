The XS is worth it
Does everything it says it does.  I love the speed of the device and the responsiveness of the controls, and I much prefer to watch Netflix on it than my Wii.  I'm also very glad I got the XS for the wired connection because even though I have 50 Mbps business-class internet at home, I often have to buffer when using wireless, but never over wired.  My only problem is that it can't play regular Hulu videos, only Hulu Plus, but that's Hulu's fault not Roku's.
