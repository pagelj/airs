I bought this vacuum cleaner after using a friend's Dyson because I liked the idea of a bagless but wasn't about to spend $500.00 for one.  I LOVE THIS VACUUM CLEANER and the Dyson is a real clunker compared to it.  The Shark is so lightweight that it almost feels self propelled-the Dyson is a heavy, heavy monster. The cord is extra long so that you can do several rooms without having to find a new outlet.  The suction is fantastic, I have two collies that shed all year around and this vacuum handles the hair just fine.  Because it's so lightweight, it's easy to actually use the long nozzle and attachments even going up stairs.  Don't worry about changing the adjustment-I go straight from carpet onto wood and ceramic floors with no problems or damage.  Now I actually feel a little sorry for my friend with the Dyson-he paid a lot of money for a heavy, awkward and expensive machine just to get the name.
