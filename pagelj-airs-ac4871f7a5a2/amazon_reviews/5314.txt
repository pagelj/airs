doggy cam
I got this camera just to keep and eye on things to make sure things are ok at home. I'm a little paranoid about the crime in my area, so this gives me great peace of mind knowing it has the alarm function. It works exactly as it should and was very easy to set up. I just purchased anther one to get a second perspective of my home, as well as to spy on the dog to see what he does while im at work. Makes my work day better to see him lounging around on the couch or running to the door when I get home.
