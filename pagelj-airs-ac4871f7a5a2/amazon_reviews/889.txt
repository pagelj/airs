Best Backpack cooler!
I bought this backpack for a trip to disney. It was exactly as described. The cooler section was actually bigger than I thought it would be. I was able to get 3 square ziploc plastic containers and 6 bottles of water and 4 juice boxes in. I used the plastic containers so the backpack would still " hold it's shape" when the cooler portion was empty. The top section was big enough to hold extra jackets and snacks. There is a zipper on the top flap which worked great for my tickets and extra money. Overall I was very happy with this bag. Since I purchased it I've used it for trips to the beach. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
