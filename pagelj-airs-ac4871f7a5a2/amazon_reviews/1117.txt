Love it!
Absolutely love my new kindle. You get a full fledged tablet at a fraction of the price.  Great customer service as well. I called both us mail and amazon with a shipping question. Us mail couldn't even tell me if my package had been sent yet. While amazon knew exactly where it was and every place it had been which happened to be in my town were it sat for 3 days because USPS is mentally challenged but that's another story.
