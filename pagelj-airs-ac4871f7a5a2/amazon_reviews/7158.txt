OK, But Has Some Limitations
EDIT: Energizer has responded to my review and addressed some of my concerns, so I have increased the rating from 3 to 4 stars. The Energizer unit does fit into the cup holder in my Honda, but the power cord sticks out such that the unit sits at an angle. It does seem to work as claimed, but it has some LIMITATIONS a buyer needs to consider. Limitations:1. Power is only 180 watts which may not be enough for the intended use. For example, my Acer laptop 120 volt power adapter's specs require 1.6 amps of power, which would be marginal output for the Energizer. EDIT:  In the comment below, Energizer noted that the unit WILL power my laptop charger since the spec 1.6 amp is based on only 100V.2. The Energizer manual states that some "small nickel cadmium batteries can be damaged if connected to the" Energizer.  It goes on to say that it should NOT be used with "Small battery operated appliances like . . . rechargeable flashlights and some rechargeable shavers."3. The Energizer has 4 USB plugins which is great, but the total output is only 2.1 amp (for ALL 4).4. It should not be used at temperatures over 100F. This would be a problem for summer weather, especially in the south.5. The manual warns that the unit draws significant power from a vehicle's battery while powering a device, and recommends that the vehicle be started every hour before the battery voltage drops too low.6. Some vehicles have a cigarette lighter receptacle that is always on (does not shut off when you remove the key).  It should be noted that even when the unit is not powering any devices, it has a current draw of 0.4 amps (at 12 volts). The manual warns to unplug the unit to prevent a discharge of the battery.7. The power output is not sinusoidal and has a total harmonic distortion of 30%.
