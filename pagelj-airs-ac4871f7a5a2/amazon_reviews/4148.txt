Tamron 18-200mm lens
For the money, this lens does all that is expected. Of course there are better lenses, but they cost much much more. But remember, it's the photographer more than it is the lens... You can go the same distance in a Honda that you can in a RR or Bentley. This lens is like a very nice Honda, and it takes you where you need to go!
