Won't let you use the the internet features because the updates will not work.
I tried everything except for burning a dvd and updating that way. I do not have a burner to make this work. If Sony can't offer an easy to use product like the ROKU than I will just send it back and something else. Today's technology doesn't require any need for burning DVD anymore.
