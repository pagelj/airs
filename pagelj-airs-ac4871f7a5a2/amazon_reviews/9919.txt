They work
They do their job well. Good picture quality and have some girth to them. I don't have alot of these cables laying around, but seem to be well built and seem to fit well in the ports. If I had an internet Blue ray to use the ether-net capability I would comment, but I don't. They do pass signal to my receiver through ARC though.
