I'm so surprised!
Holy son' of a motha' this works!  The suction is blind-blowing... hehe get it?  Anyway I'm happy that this product is living to its promise.  I have this installed on my glove compartment to hold my iphone and Nexus4 next to my LCD screen.  I love the fact that 1.) easy to install 2.) stays put and never comes off 3.) I drive roughly and this product minimizes the rattling / vibration so I can still see my porno while driving... j/k so I can still see my GPS. 4.) complete sexiness!  I recommend depressing the holder to prolong the life of the springs that retracts the holder so this product will last you a lifetime.  Great buy!
