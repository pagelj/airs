4th Roku
We are Netflix junkies and actually watch Netflix more than anything else these days. We originally had the  720p Roku and kept upgrading every time they brought out a new one after that. Naturally we purchased the Roku 2 XS very early on and I admit the first week or two I was a little disappointed, but Roku has upgraded the firm ware a few times now and it is pretty stable, at least using the wired network  connection. I never used wireless much so I can not say much about that.  The first time you start up the Roku 2 it will download the latest firm ware so you should be good from the start. There have been many reviews that describe the features so there is no need to repeat them. One thing to keep in mind should you buy one is there are "private" channels that are not listed in the channel store but you can still add them with the proper codes. `Here are a couple of the Roku channel lists that includes private channels too. Some are no longer private, and some are no longer available.[...][...][...]If you are an Amazon Prime member there are several movies & TV shows available for free, but I do not think the Amazon  channel is as well organized as the Netflix channel, so we tend to use Netflix the most.
