This is a pretty cool concealment case. I recently bought a Kel Tec P-32 as well as this case for the woman. The P-32 fits snuggly. This is designed to be a two-hand draw. You draw from the case with one hand and push through the holes at the bottom with the other. For reference, this pistol is 5.1" in length, 3.5" in height, and .75" in width. Please ignore the 1-star reviews on this product where folks complain that nothing fits; it's called doing your research. You don't buy a size 8 shoe for your size 11 foot and then complain that the shoe is too small!
