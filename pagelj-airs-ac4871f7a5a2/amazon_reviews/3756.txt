Tasty Dogs better than Microwave dogs
**********Up Date 5/24/2013**********Well I have used this on Ambassador Old Fashioned Wieners ("Old Fashioned" is a term they use to describe a natural casing and the sausage/wiener meat is pushed into it and then the ends twisted to make the links). These are thin wieners (thinner than Oscar Mayer) so no problem to use this, however these became overly tough, though tasty, I can not recommend it to cook old fashioned style wieners. Still does a great job on the Oscar Mayer Hot Dogs. One last thing sometimes grease from the hot dog can make it smoke, no big deal.**************************************************************************************I like this product.  Every now and then I like a hot dog, but the microwave though fast just doesn't cut it, I used it anyway UNTIL I got this from a local retailer on sale for $19.99. First of all read the directions it's not long.  I did two empty "burn ins" the directions don't say this but I recommend this. There is a sticker that says it's normal to smoke for the first few uses, I say do them empty. Like the directions say different hot dogs and buns will cook differently and room temperature hot dogs cook faster, YUCK not safe food handling. This is what I did with Oscar Mayer Hot Dogs (Original)from the  cooked them on #2 and then put the buns in and cooked them at #5.  PERFECT. Now the buns I used did not toast brown but they did toast, and it does say in the directions different hot dogs and buns will cook differently and it's basically trial and error.  I still liked a the toasting it did because the bun did not get all soggy. I am very happy with this the dogs cook almost as fast as a microwave and definitely taste better because it's like they were grilled on a BBQ. I will add to this as I use other brands of hot dogs.
