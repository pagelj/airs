Great mount
I have purchased three of the Cheetah Brand mounts.  The first was a for a 26" tv and the other two were for a 42" tv.  Two of the three are up and working properly.  The third I have not gotten to yet.  The only thing I recommend is you will need a longer screw driver to tighten the screws once the tv is up.  That was a pain, but nothing too bad.
