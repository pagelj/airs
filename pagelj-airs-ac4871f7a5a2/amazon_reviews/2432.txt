Good laptop light
While I cannot speak to durability because I have had this three LED light only a few days, I am satisfied with it.  It illuminates the keyboard on my 15.6" laptop just fine (and my older eyes need lots of light). It is not too big, not intrusive.  The flexible "wire" is stiff enough to hold in the position I place it which is near the keyboard so it doesn't block my view of the display screen.  I was attracted to this particular light because of the on/off switch... am pleased with this toggle switch. The USB connection is appropriately tight. The packaging describes the item as having a 17 inch Ultra Flexible Arm, a metal tube. The manufacturer is Honk.
