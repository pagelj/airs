Sony BDP S 580
I bought this product two days ago. I am using it mainly for playing Netflix which works just fine so far. The menus are easy to navigate and set up is easy but not fast. Some people complain about being unable to play Netflix. In order to do that, you have to first find your registration code ( click network icon,then Activate Enhanced Features and pres enter)after that register your unit at Sony web page([...]) and then at Netflix. Both registration did not take more than 10 seconds. I do use slow wireless connection ( up to 2.7 MB) but the picture quality is quite good without delays, etc. I am using windows 7 and it might helped with recognizing the unit on my network right away without a glitch.  Before using this unit, remember to turn on your computer  so you can proceed with your registration and activation right away and you should be just fine.
