Love IT!
I love this Samsung Tablet. It has clear sound and great screen resolution. This is my first Tablet and I wanted something affordable yet with good reviews.  I have found it easy to use and logically set up. I am traveling next month to visit my out of state daughter and didn't want to lug my lap top with me. The first time on the Tablet I was able to access my email without any problems and that was my main concern. I am looking forward to puting my music and pictures on it while using the apps. This tablet is something that I can grow into without  it being out of date in a few months.
