Bracket is OK, Documents are pitiful.......
This is a pretty decent bracket overall, for cheap.  Comes with a nice bag of fasteners to mount the TV and (2) big wood screws and anchors to mount the bracket to the wall. HOWEVER, be warned that the instructions do NOT tell you what the pilot hole size needs to be for the anchors.  I started out with a 1/4" hole and it was too small.  Then I drilled to 5/16" and the anchors spun because the hole was too big.  So I had to Spackle those holes over and I just gave up and moved over to a stud. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints about it and would buy it again.  Other than the anchor holes, I would have given 4 or 5 stars.
