Surprised our house hasn't burned down by now
I was under the impression that when I set the level of done-ness and heard a ticking sound that the toaster oven was, in fact, counting down until my food would be done to the desired level, at which point the oven would turn off and ding. This was a poor assumption, apparently. Whether you set the oven to light, medium, or dark, it just keeps toasting. And toasting. And toasting. It never dings. It never turns off. It just burns the food. Once, in fact, I opened the door, pulled out the food, shut the door, and manually cranked the knob to the off position--and the toaster oven *still* didn't turn off. I sort of feel like I could just light a fire in my kitchen and put bread on top--it would be the same system. We are keeping this little hazzard unplugged until I can lug it to a proper disposal area.
