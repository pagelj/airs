Excellent!
I love my Roku 3! Fast downloads and streaming.  I was worried that my internet speed of 5mg wouldn't be enough for streaming HD movies and shows, but I haven't had any problems.  Works flawlessly.  I'm getting a second one for my other tv. I just wish it had a better channel selection.  There are a lot of channels to choose from, but the content is below my expectations. I'm mainly using my Roku for streaming with my Amazon Prime account.
