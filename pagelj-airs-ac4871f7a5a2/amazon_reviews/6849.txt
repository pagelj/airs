Terrible Firmware
What an absolute disappointment. The player has the capability to play mp4 files, as well as mkv and many more, but alas only through the usb, and not through streaming from your server, using dlna. It however doesn't seem to be able to play flv files at all. I'll be returning my unit tomorrow, really getting sick and tired of trying to find standards being upheld by corporations. They throw stuff out faster than their tech/customer service people can learn them. And the result is flawed unit with terrible firmware.
