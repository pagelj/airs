this phone is really good
I had this phone for 3 months already and it is fast, I have no lag issues yet. I had the Samsung galaxy indulge 4g for two years and I always had problems with it everyday. I don't have problems with coverage or data, the data on metro is faster than sprint and the other small counter parts of it, mainly just happy that I got this phone, the battery last all day even after listing music for 12 hours and I still use the internet for like 2 hours more and talk, I still have about 40% of battery after all that, I have no problems with this phone, I really enjoy having it
