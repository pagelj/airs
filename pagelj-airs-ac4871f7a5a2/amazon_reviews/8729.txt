I bought this vacuum cleaner 10 months ago and I should have returned it 9 months ago. I cannot use the setting for low carpets or bare floors - on low carpets and bare floors without it overheating and shutting itself off! Additionally the on-board tools do not work - they lack strong suction. Also I have to vacuum over an area about 5 times before it picks up all the dirt!  A waste of money. I need to buy a new vacuum!
