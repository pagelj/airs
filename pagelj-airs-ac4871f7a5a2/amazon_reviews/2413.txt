This Roku ROCKS!
My girlfriend wanted to add another Roku to her home.  She has one already in the living room but she wanted one for another room too so we looked at what was available.  This Roku has great alternatives for using RCA style cables for sound and video and will work with many stereo and TV input/outputs.  We like the remote on the LT better than the gaming remote found on the top of the line Roku. Roku LT Streaming Player
