After recently inheriting a beautiful German Shepard, we found ourselves using triple the amount of "Swiffer" pads (... or, more..) that we were using before the dog came to live with us. We wondered whether we should buy stock in "Swiffer" or, proceed to Plan B -our faithful Amazon. We previewed many of the Amazon reviews and promptly placed an order. Upon arrival, it was easily assembled in about 3 snaps. The vacuum is lightweight and, after a few swipes, we were used to the flexibility of the vacuum. It is so easy to lift and move about, as well as being extremely effective, that we use it everyday. It does extremely well along baseboards and moulding. It has plently of strong direct suction that effectively picks up ALL of the dog hair. We could immediately see how well it worked via the clear recepticle. Amazed at what it picked up! Recepticle is very easy to clean. I dump it and run a damp papertowel around it and it's ready for the next use. The cord is plenty long to run down the hallway/ entry and back around to the large kitchen/dining area. We were initally concerned about the possibility of scratching the hardwood but, no worries here. I was so pleased with it, I immediately bought one for my brother and his wife, who just had their hardwood put in. (3 cats, 2 dogs) They love it. Great Bang for the Buck! Knocks the expensive models outta the park!
