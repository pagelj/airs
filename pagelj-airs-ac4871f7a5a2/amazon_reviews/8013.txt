We are quite happy with this
We were looking for something like this to hold our iPhone in the car. This device works well-- it sticks to the windshield with no problem and it hold the phone well. It is easy to remove the phone if necessary. Finally, the price is quite reasonable and we were not able to find a similar Car Mount Holder in the Apple Store.
