Cute, but not worth the $
I have a friend who purchased the Kate Spade red patent leather cover for her Kindle Keyboard and loved it so much I wanted something similar for my regular Kindle. I was a little disappointed in the lack of choices, but settled on the black and white dots pattern. When I received it I felt totally duped because I paid roughly $70 for a case that is made out of cheap materials (it feels like cardboard) and really doesn't offer any support, cushion or protection for my kindle. Even the Kate Spade tag on the front is made of plastic and looks really cheap. I was really hoping for the same kind of quality that my friend found with her case, but I guess not. It will defintiley make me think twice before purchasing anything Kate Spade, especially as this was my first experience with her products :(
