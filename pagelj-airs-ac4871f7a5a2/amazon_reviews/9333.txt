Just bought another one!
My daughter had a camera like this for 3 years, she played with it all the time!  She actually liked the games more than the camera. They are easy to play (the memory game was her favorite).  My son is 2 years old and wants my phone/camera to play with.  He's quite destructive, though, so I needed another option.  Unfortunately the Vtech camera we had was long gone, so I headed over to Amazon to purchase a replacement. I can't wait to see my son's face on Christmas morning when he finds his very own camera!
