comfortable in their own skin
i have read reviews of those that love love love this ,calling it a masterpiece ,and other that trash it saying they where long time fans and this is a piece of poop... I am 47 yrs old ,why is this important , well i have listened &gone to see to more rock,country, rap ,punk and jazz ,and blues artist then i can remember ... I like this band ,that said this is not a masterpiece ,but a band that is comfortable in their own skin now and flexing great musical muscle..."Black parade" was a huge leap forward for them & this is a solid follow up .. much in the same vain that "Joshua tree " brought us U2 we know now or like prayer intro'd us to the big voice we now think of as Madonna.... I like all the songs on this album ,the 1st 10 r super ,i personally believe its about 3 or 4 songs to long... it could of been a really really tight album leaving us wanting more ... that said the remaining songs are still really good and this is a minor crit of the work ... if your a fan of good solid rock music ,buy this if your a mcr fan and looking for the"old mcr" go away ... now ,,No real artist of any kind stays the same or all they are doing is variations of the same and that's boring..
