Heavy But Happy
After watching youtube and deciding what tomahawk i want this one is still my favorite choice. The M48 green tomahawk looks cool but not durable. The other tomahawks look weak and to small for me. The cold steel one is a little heavy but worth it. Built well very durable looks like it will last a long time its a little long but thats ok with me. You will love the sheath no belt straps but you can make one easy. Keep it dry because this cobalt steel not stainless it will rust but it will last longer. Great multi task weapon and camping tool when your out in the woods.
