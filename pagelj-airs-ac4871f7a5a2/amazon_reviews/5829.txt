remove the paper or the green lights won't come on
The batteries come fully charged, so you would think the green charge lights would light up as soon as you plug it in. Well, don't forget you have to remove the slip of paper separating the battery from the charger thingies. The paper is really thin you don't even know it's there. But you'll think it's defective (like I did) if you don't find it and disgard it.
