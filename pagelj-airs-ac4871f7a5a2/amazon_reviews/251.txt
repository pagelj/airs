I purchased this coffee maker at Sam's Club, not on Amazon but wanted to post on here to keep people from making the same mistake.  Was really excited to have both coffee & hot water.  Unfortunately, it was a mess.  The first one took 3 or 4 weeks before it started leaking water out of the hot water chamber.  It was slowly dripping from the seams on both sides.  Took it back & got another one exactly like it.  Only took 2 days & not only was it dripping from the sides, every time I poured water into the hot water chamber, it leaked out into the coffee pot!  If I didn't have the pot on the unit, I had a HUGE mess.  Took that one back as well & am planning to look at other brands now.  Very disappointed in Cuisinart for selling such a poor product.
