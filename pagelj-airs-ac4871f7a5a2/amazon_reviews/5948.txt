macbook success
Apple has really out done themselves now!  Although it doesn't have a retina display or a disk drive, it is still the best computer I've ever owned.  It is super thin and light weight, and the guy at bust buy that showed me how to use it even dropped the one on display to prove to me that it is virtually indestructible.
