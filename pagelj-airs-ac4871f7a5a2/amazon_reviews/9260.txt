Nope, Not a good idea
I've bought 3 of these and all three were wrong. The frame of the new screen either didn't fit or was it completely backwards. Given the nature of small electronics, these components are fragile. That said, it is a rather delicate business to install these screens and given that they don't fit anyway, it only compounds the issue. I am 0 for 3 with these screens and would recommend just taking your iPhone to the Apple store for repair rather than doing it yourself. If you must tackle this on your own, buy 3 or 4 screens..... you WILL break at least one of them.... if they even fit at all. Instructions: Good (online)Included Tooling: Good (free guitar pick too)Screen: Poor (Low quality, improper fit)
