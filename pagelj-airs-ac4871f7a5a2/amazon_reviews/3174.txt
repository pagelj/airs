I was somewhat disappointed...
I ordered this Razr because it said it was new, AT&T and by Motorola, but after charging it up and turning iton the name that comes up first is T-Mobile!  The phone came with a charger and after the phone was fully charged, Iwent to pull the box with the prongs attached and the box started to come apart where the seam is and I had to reallytake hold on it so it wouldn't come totally open and the wires would be totally exposed! I still have my old charger from my previous razr and I use that to charge the phone battery and that is every other day!! What's that about?! I work and so I'm not on my phone through the day and I really don't text.. but I ordered it and that's what I got.
