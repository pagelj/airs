Returning it right away
The baby monitor arrived expeditiously as every other product I buy from Amazon.  As soon as you open the box, you realize that the quality of the materials is substandard.  The monitor is made of cheap plastic, and the back clip/stand will not stand to the test of daily use.  On the positive side, the monitor has a really big screen, but that is where the positive ends.  This product was evidently not engineered with the end user in mind:(1) It lacks a video on/off switch.  If you turn the VOX on, the video will turn off after three minutes of silence, so if you want to check on your sleeping baby you would have to turn the VOX off.  If you leave the VOX off, the video will be on constantly, draining your battery and disrupting your sleep.(2) There is no battery charge meter so that you can track your battery life.(3) The camera has red lights around it that turn on when the infrared is on, potentially disturbing your baby's sleep.(4) If you want to toggle between two cameras, you have to go through the entire 4-camera cycle every time.  The monitor should "know" how many cameras you have paired and only cycle through those.(5) Forget about monitoring two babies in different rooms simultaneously.  Unless you stay awake all night and cycle through your different cameras every so often, the camera the monitor will ignore the camera that is not selected.  If you fell asleep with the monitor looking at baby #1 you will never know when baby #2 wakes up crying at 3AM.  There should be a function that "listens" to all cameras and feeds video of the camera that picks up noise. Bottom line, we are returning this product.
