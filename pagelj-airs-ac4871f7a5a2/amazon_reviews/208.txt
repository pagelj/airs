I LOVE THIS COLLAR!
I wasn't expecting too much because of the price, but then again I couldn't justify spending $100 or more on a training tool that was only going to be used temporarily BUT I love this collar!  I got it for my 65 lb pitbull who I could never trust off-leash.  He would come when he felt like it, especially with all the distractions outside.  He's been wearing the collar for a few days now with no corrections yet, as I don't want him to associate the collar with the correction.  Today, we went to an open field... he ran around like a crazy man and hesitated coming back to me, so I used the vibration mode on setting 55 and he immediately noted it and came to me!  Success!  We did this for about 30 minutes.  So, needless to say, it was $25 very well spent!
