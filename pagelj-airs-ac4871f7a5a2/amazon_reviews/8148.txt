Great Album
I wasn't the biggest MCR fan going into this album but my girlfriend likes them alot so I listened to their previous album and started to get into them.  The variation of songs on the Black Parade are something that isn't found much these days.  You have the teenage angst song appropriately named "Teenagers", the anthem songs "Welcome to the Black Parade" and "Famous Last Words", more morose songs "Cancer" and "Terrors", and the rest are all good too. My favorite song is Famous Last Words and the radio played Welcome to the Black Parade to death.  This CD will definitely be one that I keep coming back to.  Great job, MCR.
