Product not worth the money it costs, customer suport terrible
I would never recommend this product or the company that produces it to anyone.  The DVDs produced are fuzzy, with lines and wobbling pictures and did not meet my expectations in any way.  The customer service department from this company is  no help at all.  After contacting them several times, and even being required to send them a video clip, they refuse to honor their product and will not except returns of products that do not work correctly.  They have never mentioned sending another product to replace the faulty converter.  Save your money - buy something else.
