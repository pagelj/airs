Little disappointed with the selection
I bought this with the purchase of a new tv so that I would get a more HD experience through netflix, amazon, as well as previously owned dvds. The product has not disappointed in any of these areas. I chose this over Roku so I could play dvds. Previously I used the Wii for netflix and got this product because it offered amazon. Of course right after I bought this Wii put amazon on it. I am regretting the purchase because Sony really does not offer many other channels on its network. Can only hope they continue to expand their offerings. But I might return it.
