Thrilling...
This is an incredible HD player.  Just when you think DVD was a step above VHS, think again... it will make your regular DVD's look like VHS.  The picture is super crisp, colors are richer, deeper, and more realistic than before.  Subtle little details that you didn't notice before all of a sudden come alive.  For example since the HD player comes with King Kong, things like little air particles in the air become noticable.  The sound is also amazing... with surround sound and a large HDTV you're set for the theatre. If you are already using your 360 to watch DVD's this player will also make normal DVD's look better alot better.  Even though it'll scale regular DVD to look better, it won't compare to HD DVDs.  Comparing regular and HD on my Toshiba 34", DVD's were tremendously grainy, blurry,  and duller.  High definition is definetly here and the way to go.  You might not want to bother with this if you don't have an HDTV, but if you do this is what is necessary for maximum picture and sound. The only downfall as most have stated is its lack of HDMI, currently it can only play high definition analogy-wise only not digital with HDMI.  Hopefully Microsoft will consider HDMI in the near future for the Xbox 360, for now this is an incredible upgrade for your game and home theatre system.
