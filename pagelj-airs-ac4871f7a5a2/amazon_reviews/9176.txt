Better than I thought it would be
I was a little skeptical about this, especially since the thought of eating a raw egg is not appealing to me.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this does exactly what it says.  It took me a little fine tuning regarding what type of egg I wanted, determined by the amount of water added.  But after that it has been a very good purchase.  I enjoy this item.
