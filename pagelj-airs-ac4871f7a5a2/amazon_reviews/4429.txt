Heavy duty TV mount
We recently purchased this Cheetah Mount, and was suprised how strongly built this mount is.  Was relatively easy to mount, if wall studs are within the specified spaces, which is also good, is that mount has variable distance holes that can be used if the studs are not on the usual 16" space between each stud, which in Our case, an older house where the studs are definitely not always on 16" alignment.  No special tools are needed, a wrench, pair of pliers would be enough but a socket wrench does makes things easier, otherwise, not very difficult and can be done within an hour.  After hanging this mount in place, I did put a lot of my weight on it (200 lbs.) and, it proved to be more than sufficient for the weight of all of today's large Plasma, and, LCD TV's.  This mount is very universal, and, can be used mounting all brand names of televisions.  The said movements, and angles, of this mount are excellent, and the movements are not flimsy whatsoever, no one has to be worried about how much they would angle their television of this Cheetah mount.  This mount also comes with a 10' HDMI cable, which is a great addition for the price of this mount, which is priced at about $169.00 at one of those "Best" retail stores.  This is an excellent mount, and for the price, is a definite must for those that have, or are going to purchase a Large television, don't take a chance leaving it on a stand, where it could be knocked over, warranties just don't cover any damages on televisions that are caused by getting knocked over.  You will be very pleased when purchasing this Cheetah mount.
