Really Works Well- Once It Get's Going!
I find this player easy to use. It has nice features and the set up was very easy to accomplish. So why the low review? Starting it up is a real wrestling match. You turn it on and it says "loading" ... you wait, and you cannot do anything ... you wait, and wait, and ... you get the idea. Also, opening the tray is the same problem. We have experimented and held the 'open' button when off and it opens (sometimes) ... you put a disk in then .... um ... uh ... So, we turn it off, then on again. Still, it cooperates when it feels like it. We've 'lucked out' by holding down the play button when it's off- but not always. It's an enigma because it works great once ... it does, however the insanely slow bring-up has become a deterrent to using it. I plan to return it and get another brand.
