Not for me,  but okay for teenagers
My grandchildren talked me into reading this book. They are 11 and 14; this is great book for that age group, but not for a 65  year old man like myself. I read the entire book though I was tempted every chapter  to quit wasting my time. Nothing  really happens for the first 80%  of the book. The author  states that from a  letter he received the book had a profound impact on a couple of teenagers, which I think goes to prove my point that this is a young adult book and a very good one for that age group. I am at a loss to understand the awards it received. Usually Science Fiction books have to appeal to a wider audience than this one did to receive awards.  If you ever saw the movie "Starship Troopers" you will also wonder about the originality of the book. I am always encouraging my grandchildren to read so I  don't want them to think I dismiss what they read, just as long as they get in the habit of reading. I also read  "The Hunger Games"  at their suggestion. This is another book aimed at a younger audience though I think it is too violent for them. I also think it was not original. Watch the Japanese move "Battle Royale". It was aimed at teenagers, but when it was released the Japanese government insisted  on an equivalent X rating because of the excessive violence. The violence was in my opinion was  less than "The Hunger Games"  The author of  "The Hunger Games" when questioned about the similarities of her book to the movie she claimed she had never seen the movie. I think the violence in this book is not excessive, especially the way it is presented. I have no problem with my grandchildren reading it.
