Easy to install for two people. Strong sturdy construction supporting a 55" plasma. Excellent adjustment to tilt, escalate range. Nice unexpected touch of the inclusion of many different types of mounting bolts. This wall mount meets it all! Glitches are... level is not not level on the unit so an external one was needed. But that's all folks!... and we were going to pay $300 for installation and $179 additional for the mount! Huh!
