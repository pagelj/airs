I'm very pleased with this Cuisinart toaster oven. The toast darkness setting mechanism is easy to use, the bread toasts quickly, and once I found the ideal darkness setting, the results have been consistent. The oven and broiler work well, too. It will certainly stand in for my regular oven this summer.
