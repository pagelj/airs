An Amazing Jouney
I have not seen any DVD version of this film but have seen the theater version in 3-D three different times (once on IMAX screen, which did not add that much to the movie).  At the end of the movie the first time I viewed it, the audience actually clapped their hands (something that I had not witnessed in any movie for several years).  But, the images from Avatar were that extraordinary.  It is eye candy for senses and well worth the money spent.  As I said, I saw it three times with three different people and was anxious to see it every time.  In fact, if anyone asked me today if I wanted to go again I would gladly attend.  I have not seen this movie in 2-D so I do not know how it will translate into a DVD. The plot (good guys against bad guys - in this case the bad guys are human) has been done so many times before.  A lot of the characteristics of the good guys seemed to be replicated from American Indians and the human military personnel versus the scientific personnel was somewhat of a cliche.  One factor of the movie that should be well received with today's economic problems is the depiction of the big corporation's willingness to sacrifice whatever in order to realize profit. What makes this movie great is the magnificent scenes - floating mountains, the flying episodes, the vivid colors.  This may sound like more of a travelogue but there is enough story (including a love story and incredible battle scenes)to make this a very entertaining film. I am not sure that I would be satisfied with a 2-D DVD version of the movie but I would be afraid of a 3-D version based on current DVD technology - I am not inclined to purchase a 3-D TV due to current cost, limited programing and the potential problems associated with a new product.  With that said, I will most likely purchase the DVD (now or in the future) in order to revisit this tremendous film.
