It worked fine for about 30 cups of coffee and then the pressure droped to 0. Since it was under warranty, I took it to an authorized repair shop, about 3 months ago and I am still waiting to to get it back. Apparantly, service dept. can't get the parts to repair it. With this kind of lousy customer service, De'Longhi has lost me as a customer for their other products as well.
