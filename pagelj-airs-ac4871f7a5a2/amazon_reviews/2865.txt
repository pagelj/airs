The vacuum was fairly easy to assemble with the step-by-step instructions. The suction is great.  The thing I like most is that the debris is contained to the bag, so I don't get that stale dirt smell every time I vacuum.  I also like that the power switch is right at hand level and the power cord is very long. I'm so glad to have found this little treasure.
