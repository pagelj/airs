Fantastic!
For the price I paid for these headphones, the sound quality is great! I have a lumia 920 & these look even better with the phone! I always run through a cheap pair of headphones because the headphone tip usually breaks and starts losing sound in one ear. I have had these for about two months so far, and even though that is not a long time, I can happily say if they broke tomorrow I would still be happy wit the purchase I made.  With all the great reviews, I ordered 3 pairs. So I'll say it again, for the quality and the price, you cannot go wrong. Buy them!
