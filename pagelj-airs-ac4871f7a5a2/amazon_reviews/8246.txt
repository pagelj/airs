I use this little vac to keep the tile floors in the upstairs bathrooms clean. Does a great job, is lightweight, and stands up straight on its own for easy storage. The whole dust cup configuration is pretty standard for stick vacuums of this type, and I've been pleased with the performance and convenience.
