I received 3mm, not 2mm...
Has nobody else noticed that this tape is advertised as 2mm wide and what is received is 3mm wide? Am I the only one out of 125 reviews that go wider tape? I bought this because I needed 2mm wide tape, not 3mm. Thankfully, it's not too expensive. I guess I'll have to try one of the other 2mm choices.
