Nice camera, a little slow in low light
After trying a similar Panasonic and Nikon, the third time with this Canon was the charm. Really nice feature set, incredible pictures in good light (exceptional outdoors), reasonable 'pocket to picture' time. BUT, I am finding it a little slow and finicky indoors in situations where the flash is needed. Takes a few extra seconds to adjust focus for the flash I guess, which can mean the difference between a good and bad picture when the subject is little kids like ours. All of my previous Canons were made in Japan, this one is made in China. Sign of the times, I guess, but pretty disappointing. I'd rather pay an extra $50 for quality for something as important as a family camera.
