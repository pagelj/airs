I raised my three sons watching this lovely ditty!!
The issues raised promote healthy moral issues regarding friends and being different and successful in social groups. It is so so funny while focusing on issues that mean much to some and not so much to others. Respectability toward persons of good intent while removing yourself from persons that aredamaging to anyone. Goes further than 'sticks and stones will harm you but words never will'.  It's a start to a conversation with childrenregarding the fact that words can be very harmful... and not all people are good.
