Excellent Customer Service
I was shipped one battery and it was defective.  I returned it and my money was refunded.  In an attempt to give great customer service, Tech-Orbits sent another.  The battery worked, however it's still not able to hold a charge longer than a half hour.  I am very appreciative that they were willing to ship another free of charge.  There are very few businesses out there that try to make things right.  I thought it was excellent customer service.
