It works in the sense you do get a cup of decent tasting coffee in the end. However I noticed (1) the first 1-2 ounces of drop is basically clear water, which indicates the extraction is not working well in the beginning; (2) I poured in a full glass water up to the max marker, only got 90% back coffee. The rest was either stuck somewhere inside or evaporated, a mystery; (3) only 3 holes in the hot water drop head, 6 would be better for even extraction. I noticed this in the used coffee in the scoop; (4) the coffee may foam up to touch the hot water drop head, and I had to rinse the coffee grinds off in the sink after use, holding the coffee maker up side down in the tab water, a messy hassle. A deeper scoop may avoid the problem. After a few times I put it away in my office closet and went back to my usual mnaual extraction, the best, the most mobile, and free coffee making.
