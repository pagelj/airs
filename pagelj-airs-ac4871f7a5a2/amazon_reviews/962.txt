Definitely recommend this toaster.  I purchased one from a store for $20 and it was cheap. Decided to try Amazon as I am not patient when going store to store to look for small appliances.  This 4 slice toaster fit our needs and budget.  It does not toast bagels evenly the first time, but we are still getting adjusted to this appliance and overall, we love it and are very happy with the purchase!
