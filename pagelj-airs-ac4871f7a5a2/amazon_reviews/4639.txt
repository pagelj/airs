Very poor quality
It is a great idea, but the quality is so poor that you should save your money.  I bought one and it worked for a few months, then the toaster started buzzing and I thought it was going to start sparking.  I called the company and they sent us another one, but that one stopped working after a few times.  I gave up on it and tossed it into the trash.
