slow and heavy but good image quality
This is an all in one lens and for one that goes from 28mm all the way to 300mm the quality of the images is very good. At almost all focal lengths it is a f5.6 lens so it takes 4x the light of a f2.8 zoom like the Nikon 70-200mm or a 17-55mm lens but is the same speed as the Nikon 70-300 while being a lot wider at the short zoom end. At a focal length zoom of more than 70mm the inner barrel of the lens starts to extend out the front and my 300mm the lens has doubled in length. Not a subtle lens to use for street photography if that is your interest. VR is excellent and I get sharp images at 300mm at 1/125 second which is quite good. The old rule of thumb was a reciprocal exposure of 1/focal length but in actual practice with long lenses I find that I need twice that speed so to guarantee a sharp picture every time with a 300mm lens I need 1/600. To get this with a shutter speed four times as long demonstrates the benefits of VR for a slow lens like this one. Autofocus is very fast and I never felt I had to wait for the lens to lock on before pressing the shutter. I detected no tendency to front or back focus with this lens on my D700. Lens comes with a pouch but I see no benefit to using one either for storage where the lens goes into a plastic drawer or in my camera bag where I want to get to it quickly. The lens hood snaps off for storing the lens but it stays on for the most part when in use though not anywhere nearly as securely as a screw on lens hood. The lens works best on a camera like the D700 where ISO 1600 is not a problem in getting pictures with minimal noise. It is not a good lens for cameras like the D2h or D2x which struggle at ISO 640 and are worthless at ISO 800.
