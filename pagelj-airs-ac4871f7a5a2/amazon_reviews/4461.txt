If you like motion sickness...
I remember watching this movies as a kid. I always loved it so I wanted to give it as a gift to my daughter for Christmas. The picture quality is terrible. The picture shakes and moves back and forth, it's hard to watch, even giving me motion sickness. We paid $4.99 for this and I'm debaiting on weather or  I will send this back.  I guess you get what you pay for and this movie is probably something Disney won't "re do" like they would a classic, like dumbo or Cinderella. Maybe next time!
