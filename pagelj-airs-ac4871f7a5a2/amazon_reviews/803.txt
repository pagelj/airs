Surprisingly high quality
It didn't take much effort for me to set this up with my Windows XP machine (I know, I'm behind the times), and the video it produced was surprisingly good - better than the one in my late-2011 Macbook Pro or any of my housemates' webcams.  Not only is the resolution sufficiently high, but the color is picked up much better than I expected for something of this price.
