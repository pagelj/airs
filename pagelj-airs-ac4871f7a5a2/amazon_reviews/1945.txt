absolutely fabulous!
this backpack is absolutely fabulous! im going back to highschool for my senior year in about 3 weeks so i wanted an amazing backpack. This was the right choice! i got it today and when i opened the package i was blown away. it was gorgeous, so gorgeous that all i could say was wow! i love all the pockets and the material on the inside is a beautiful gold color it even came with a cute pair of pink socks that said gift on it, i decided to take it out for a spin around town with my friends and i got alot of compliments on it also it was big enough to fit my purchases and hold my other stuff. all i can say is senior year here i come!
