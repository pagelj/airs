well, it won't even turn on!
I got this on two day shipping so we could take it on a road trip tomorrow but it will NOT turn on, though it shows fully charged. I will have to send it back but don't have time now. GRRRR. I have never owned one of these before so I read and re-read all the instructions and tried everything at least twice. The design is fabulous with the swivel etc - and though it has many features I probably wouldn't use, it would be a great deal if only it worked.
