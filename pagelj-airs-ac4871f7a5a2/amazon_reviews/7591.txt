Love my Griddler!
After much research I decided on this grill.  It's very stable and doesn't have the "cheap" feel and look.  I've cooked steak, chicken, and fish and have been very happy with all.  I've not had a problem with grease running out the back but only to the front into the cups.  I do wish I could get the bottom of the meat to get as nice and brown as the top but this isn't a real problem... just a preference.  I highly recommend the Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler.
