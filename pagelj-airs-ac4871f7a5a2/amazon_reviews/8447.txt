Love it...
The phones shipped the very next day. I really like the PRIME feature even though I don't order a lot I order enough during the year that it makes up for itself, esp when I order large products. I also like it for movie watching on my smart TV. Now on to the Panasonic KX-TG... I love it!!! My husband is currently playing with the features as I type. We have always used and bought our parents Panasonics but this time I did web research and this one was the #1 rated home phone of 2012. I can see why. We are going to use the bluetooth feature soon.
