Netflix Problems
I'm overall very pleased with this Blu-ray player, with the exception of issues while viewing Netflix.  As is also mentioned in other reviews, as well as the product forum, I have intermittent issues with black flashes while streaming Netflix.  I've been streaming a lot to try to get a sense of how bad the problem is in order to determine if I should return this.  It happens with about 75% of the movies I've streamed.  With some, it's a minor nuisance.  With others, movies become unwatchable because the flashing occurs multiple times per second.  From what I've read on Amazon and other sizes, neither Panasonic nor Netflix can figure out what's wrong.  I'd like to think that this problem would eventually be fixed, but since it has not been yet, that's probably unlikely. I'm probably being overly generous by only deducting one star for this, since the Netflix streaming feature is very important to me.
