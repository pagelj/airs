Just ordered my THIRD one of these.  I am verifying that these have about a 2 year shelf-life.  Bought 1st in 2005; 2nd in 2007.  Toaster died in both.  On 2nd one, kept on making hard boiled eggs (the coolest feature) but no-go tonight. Can't believe I'm doing this, but when ALL the parts work it is fantastically wonderful.  Either this product is really good or something is wrong with me. (This review submitted by the mother of "Sir Richard Jones" - what's that about?  Need to ask the kid if he's been using my logon.)
