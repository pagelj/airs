Great Portable DVD Case
This portable DVD player case is a must have... it's small enough to carry everywhere and has enough space to fit a few dvds and the charger. We had a hard time finding a case that was made for our SUV (Nissan Rogue) and for a rear facing carseat. It stays securely on the headrest and fits nicely under the seats.  I would recommend this to everyone!
