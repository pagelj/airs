The Black Parade -- An Exceptional Album!
I'm a new fan to MCR, but their Black Parade video promotion got me hooked on their unique implementation of 70's glam rock elements (a la Queen) and neo-Punk.  And yes, there is some Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Aerosmith thrown in there (whether intentional or not!)  I bought the album today and listened to it through a few times and was drawn into its music.  Each song is very accessible.  It's not a cheesey, manufactured album, and every track stands on its own merits. I don't know if MCR will continue down this path, but they have a sure-fire combination of sounds that will draw a broad fan-base.  I'm hooked.
