I bought this product about 3 weeks ago. The coffee is delicious! Its really easy to operate too. However, the steam wand's function entirely stopped after 3 weeks. I called Krups to troubleshoot it, and she told me I would have to return the product, and that there was no hope that it would fix itself. Basically, this machine is a gimmick. The coffee maker is durable, but the espresso part is for the infrequent user. Do not buy this if you intend to make yourself a latte every once in a while. Overall, I am disappointed in this product. I really liked it; then it broke after light usage. I only had it for 3 weeks!!
