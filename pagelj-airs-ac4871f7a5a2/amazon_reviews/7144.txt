Works For Me
It fits my Panasonic DMC-FZ35 and protects that great Leica lens so I'm happy with it. I must confess that I was momentarily confused as I'd expected it to mount on the outer ring, but it fits on the lens itself. Just extend it and it fits like a charm. I personally feel quite relieved knowing that the lens won't accidentally get dinged or scratched while I'm using the camera. I'm not intending to play catch with it, but why take the risk when you don't need to.
