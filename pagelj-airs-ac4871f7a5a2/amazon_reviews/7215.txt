great for kids
i bought this little laptop for my 11 year old daughter:pros:- the size and weight are perfect for her- the keyboard and the trackpad are surprisingly good and easy to use (even for me)- the cpu, ram and hard disk are enough for playing minecraft, open a word doc and web browsing at the same time.- the screen is bright and clear, not too reflective- it arrived with ubuntu os but i replaced it with windows 8 pro and has been working flawlessly for 4-5 weeks so farcons:- i haven't tested it with a clock but the battery life and the time it takes full charge again are not what they should- the heat at the exhaust of  the proccessor, if you place it in your lap wearing shorts is more annoying than serious, anywaysaccessories you might consider:- in regard of the point before, Opteka X-Stand Ergonomic Portable Natural Airflow Cooling Stand For all 12-17" Laptop / Notebook Computers for extra peace of mind and improving the line of view- Case Logic QNS-111 11.6-Inch EVA Molded Netbook Sleeve (Black) for carrying and caring it, have just the right size for the laptop plus power cord/charger. originally i was considering the touchscreen version but i'm very happy with this purchase, add it to the low price tag and for me is 100% recommended
