Great Job
It showed up quicker than I thought and in better condition than advertised.  I was amazed to find the DVD intact.  The binding is a little sideways but it has no effect on the product.  Also, since it is a tech. manual I plan to cut the binding off and drill some holes for a three ring binder.  Great job guys!!!  Thanks
