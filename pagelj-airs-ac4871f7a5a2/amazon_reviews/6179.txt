Rationality at work
People offended by critique of established christian doctrine would do well to stay away from this film. Indeed, this film takes us on a journey of one mans tale of having lived for 14,000 years. It`s a tale that will grip those whose innate curiosity will cause them to keep viewing even though the premise stretches the imagination, but I believe not such a stretch as is required for a belief in present day accepted religious magic. I give it 5 stars...6 were it possible.
