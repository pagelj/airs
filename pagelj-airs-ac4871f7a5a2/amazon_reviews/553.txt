It's great when a product performs as advertized
This product works great - unlike the Samurai Shark which is advertized by that loud mouth schnook. (they send you 2 Shark devices because they know it will break soon - both broke and became unusable the first day). I have sharpened all my knives with the Ozitech Sharpener and it shows no sign of wear and tear. I highly recommend it.
