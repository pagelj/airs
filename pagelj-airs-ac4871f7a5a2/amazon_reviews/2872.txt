Love this thing other than the tighten screw is ridiculously long.
I took out the tightening screw and used a set screw and tightened it with a small allen wrench I'll keep in the glove box. Every CD slot I've seen, the screen is below the cd slot so guess where the 2 inch big wing nut hangs into.... They whould have put it behind the phone, would have hid it.
