Get Roku Instead of Smart TV
BOTTOMLINE: Roku works great with varying internet speeds and has better functionality than SmartTVs with built in Apps. It is apparent that Roku has put alot of effort into optimizing their product, whereas with many smart TVs, Apps (for internet streaming) are an afterthought. MY STORY: I have an older generation Roku that I love. But then I recently decided to buy a new LED TV and decided to go with a smart Panasonic Viera with  the idea that it would have the same Roku functionality built-in without needing to have an external box and remote. WRONG! I have Verizon DSL internet which is considered high-speed, but not super fast like cable internet. Netflix doesn't work at all using the Panasonic TV's built in App - there is constant interruptions and errors. I can't be 100% certain, but after alot of troubleshooting and calling Panasonic and Netflix, it seems that the TV requires a much higher internet speed to work smoothly. In contrast, Roku works beautifully, with great picture quality and zero interruptions using this same exact internet connection. Also, navigating Netflix to select programs is a MUCH better experience using Roku as compared to the Panasonic TV App. And, the Panasonic TV doesn't even have a Hulu App. Roku is fabulous. Any of the complaints on here are splitting hairs.
