Was happy to finally reach the end
There's a lot of bad Sci-Fi stories out there, and this is one of them. For me it was just way too ultra-fantastic; wasn't even remotely believable.  I did not enjoy the story line and found myself having no empathy with really any of the characters. Usually, when reading a good story you begin to associate with the main character or at least one of the supporting cast.  Not so here. The ending was boring and anticlimactic.  This is a very thinly veiled commentary about different cultures fighting because they just don't take the time to understand one another.  I appreciate social commentary on occasion, sure, but the author might as well have labeled the various races with their 'earthly' counterpart names. Very poorly done, IMO. Why two stars instead of one?  I will often stop reading a story when it becomes obvious that the story line and characters are this bad.  It gets two stars because I *did* finish reading the thing- it had something that that made me want to finish it.  By the ending, however, I kinda wished I hadn't.
