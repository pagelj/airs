What? You havent read this yet?
How can you consider yourself a fan of Science Fiction if you've never read Ender's Game? Actually... I only just read it a month ago- but boy am I ashamed of myself for having waited so long! I had to read it again a week ago since I couldn't believe I'd loved it so much, and when phrases like, "The best book I've ever read!" come to your mind- you'd better be pretty  certain. It goes high on my list with Dune and very few others. It will  enrapture you. The story is simple. It is the future. The Earth has had  a severe run-in with a race of hostile aliens we call the "Buggers". They  have invaded our planet twice, nearly wiping us out if it weren't for some  amazing luck. Now, decades later, the Earth prepares to retaliate against  the Buggers- defeat them before a third invasion can be launched against  us. We have a massive fleet, but need a leader. With that in mind, the  military turns to children for salvation... filtering out the most brilliant  strategic minds and molding them into commanders with what it takes to win  the war. At age 6, Andrew Wiggen (ENDER) is their best hope. This is the  story of his trials and training and SO much more. Card does everything  right in Ender's Game. As a 24 year-old, I couldn't recommend any book  higher. If you are new to sci-fi, this will get you addicted. ............
