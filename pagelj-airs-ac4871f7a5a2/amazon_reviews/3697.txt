Great for travel
Great bag. I had it shipped home and then sent to me in Egypt while I was there doing some photography for the Arab spring and it served me really well. Very accessible and easy to use. If your looking for functional this hits the mark. Perhaps bulkier than other camera bags, but I dig the across the chest strap. Its been around the world with me now for more than 6 months and there are no tears or problems. Also - I got into a really nasty bike accident in Turkey with the bag (and Cannon T3I) on my back. I broke my arm but the camera still works fine, so it would suggest good protection. I'm really happy with it. 5 stars.
