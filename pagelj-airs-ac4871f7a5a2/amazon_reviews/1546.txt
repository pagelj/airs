Mine was original
The screen assembly was not a Chinese knock-off - what I received was original, with Apple written all over it. Also included was the narrow perimeter adhesive, which was die-cut and ready to apply. This is nice to have because it seals the screen edges from ingress of dust and goop. I do recommend wearing safety glasses removing the old glass during disassembly. I had a few shards of glass go airborne. The delivery was very prompt and beat the estimated arrival date by 18 days! My daughter is much happier without a busted up ipod.
