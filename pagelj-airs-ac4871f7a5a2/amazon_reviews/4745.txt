GREAT Portable DVD player
I bought the older model 730 from Sears on close out and recently bought the 750. Only diffii battery life ( as per Sony) is the 750 is 3 hours and the 730 was 5 hours. Easy to use features for my 9 &10 yr olds who now avev their own DVD for trips... no more fighting over what movie the both will watch. Got a car seat hanging case so teye can watch with the DVD in full flat open position. Resolution is perfect for the size. Cheaper models like Coby and the others have big pixel res that's annoying, not this Sony.  highly recommend this unit because it even includes a REMOTE!!
