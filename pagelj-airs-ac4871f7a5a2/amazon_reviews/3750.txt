Decent but not snug for Canon SD1000
This is a decent camera case for my Canon SD1000 Elph.  It fits the camera nice enough but the pocket on the front could be slimmer.  It's a little "puffy" for just a battery or extra memory card.  I bought this one and the slimmer neoprene Caselogic UNZB-2 at teh same time. As a guy I prefer the UNZB-2 neoprene more because it will fit in your back pocket, or coat pocket much easier and has zero extra bulk.
