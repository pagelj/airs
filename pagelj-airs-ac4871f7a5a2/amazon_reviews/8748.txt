Fun read
This book is candy for anyone who likes sci-fi, grew up in the 80s, or has played video games. The story follows the 80s movie model of having an underachieving kid who doesn't have any friends end up being the one to outsmart everyone else and become the hero. Clearly Cline had the time of his life writing this book, and his enthusiasm and non-stop nostalgia can occasionally dominate the story and creep into author intrusion, my all-time literary pet peeve. I don't want to get into details, but it can be hard to keep up with the wave of cultural references from the worlds of role-playing games, arcade games, 80s movies and music, and any other niche reference of geekdom or fandom or whatever (do you know what a vorpal blade is?). Luckily if you really don't know what something is you can easily look it up on the internet. Great story, cool adventure, and interesting glimpse at a version of what could be. This book is going to make a fun movie, and is one of the more inventive sci-fi novels to come out in the last few years.
