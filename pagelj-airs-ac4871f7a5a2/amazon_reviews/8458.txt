Good SD Card
What can I say? It work's, reads/ writes at the advertised speed, and I don't expect it to give me any trouble. I lost one of my 8gb transcend SD cards, and found it in a pants pocket 4 months later. It had been through the washing machine numerous times and it works great. I highly recommend this product.
