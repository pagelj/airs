RE-SET over and over and over again
Sony set out to make this product as complicated as possible. They succeeded at that. To connect via WIFI... you must type in a long, long WEP key numberand the remote U must use will make you type double letters so it will take about 20 minutes. USB drive works today... not tommorrow so you have to reset by unplugging waiting 10 minutesand then you get to type in the WEP key all over again because sony did not see fitto build a product that could put this in memory... unplug it and all your settings WEP keyare gone. DO NO BUY THIS CHEAP CHINESE PLAYER.
