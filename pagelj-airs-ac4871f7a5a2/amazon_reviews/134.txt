like it so far
I purchased this phone on Amazon from  a seller. The phone came in a generic Verizon box with a charger and  a USB based charger. It also came with a 4 page pamphlet on how to use it. I went online to the Verizon website and downloaded the user's guide. It was actually easy to set ringtones, answer features, etc without it. It's a nice phone if you don't want a smart phone but need/like to text. My husband went to a Verizon store to activate the phone for me. My old phone was over 7 years old and I wanted to get a plain phone but with texting capabilities. Things went OK till I got my first bill. I noticed they had added a data plan ($10/month)!!! I called Verizon that night and told them to take the data plan off since I didn't not want it or need it. Again, as some other reviewer said, this phone DOES NOT need a data plan!!! I'm really upset that the person at the store added a plan and DID NOT even say anything to my husband before doing so!!!!
