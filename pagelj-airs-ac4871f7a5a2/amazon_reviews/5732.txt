Strange toaster, but it's good at frozen waffles.
Picked this toaster up this week at a store. Figured I'd check the reviews to see if others found it as odd as I do. My main objection is that the bread doesn't come up very high when it's finished. I suppose this could be a feature in some cases, as it might stay warmer if you don't take it out right away.  But as another reviewer commented, it's tricky to get English muffins out without burning your fingers. So far it's been ok as long as I pull up on the plunger when I'm taking them out.  I'd considered returning it in anticipation of future stuck English muffins (or burned fingers). But I discovered it does a better job on frozen waffles than my old toaster did - warm on the inside without burning on the outside, yay!  So I guess I'll keep it and hope for the best. But it is a tad unnerving. Others have also commented on the weird handle. The distance of travel is short, and you have to press down fairly hard in order to get it to stay. I suppose it's just a matter of getting used to it, but I can't imagine why they designed it that way. You'd think toaster handles would be a mature technology by now.
