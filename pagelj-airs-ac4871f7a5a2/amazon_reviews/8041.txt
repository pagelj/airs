Canon's Worst Ever
I have been photographing professionally for 36 years and virtually all 35mm in my inventory is Canon, so I am more than aware of the quality optics which they can produce. However, this is patently the worst lens I have ever seen Canon roll off the assembly line. Even at the higher shutter speeds (1/1250) and on a tripod as well, this lens lacks any degree of sharpness. Do NOT purchase this lens unless you're an absolute Novice and will be photographing the family pet romping in the backyard. Save you money and go with a higher-end model.
