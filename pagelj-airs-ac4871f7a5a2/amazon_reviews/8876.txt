LOVE HATE THIS TOASTER
I love the way this toaster looks on my granite counter and love the size of it. However, this toaster burns everything if it is not set on lowest settings.  I have lost so much bread just testing and hoping I am wrong. Sadly, I am right everytime.  When I toast it on the lowest setting sometimes it is acceptable but mostly it browns underdone or burnt.  To me this is not Sunbeam quality!  This is the first Sunbeam toaster I have owned that is so cheaply made. Is this Chinese quality?  Where is it made?
