This mean green little machine for a hundred bucks beats out $500 and $700 vacuums I have tried in the past. It would seem that the more complex a vacuum, the heavier it is and the easier it breaks. This guy, on the other hand, I have bumped up and down stairs, run over hard and soft surfaces, and basically abused - and it still picks up more dirt than any of my other machines ever did. Trust me, I hate a dirty carpet. I suffer from horrible allergies. I love this vacuum cleaner so much that I bought three of them (and it was still cheaper than my cheapest Dyson) - one for permanent use upstairs, the second for permanent use downstairs - and the third just in case. I don't know why I bothered with the third, though. I'll probably never use it; these other two will most likely just keep on working. It's just that "When you find something wonderful, buy three of them" kind of mentality. Maybe I'll leave it in the box and give it to my daughter one day when she goes off to college. ;)
