Not natively compatible with Mac OSX /iPhoto
I just got the camera and I'm pleased with the quality of the photos.  However, I was shocked to find out that the camera isn't plug and play with my Macs. Or iPhoto. It is my fault that I didn't actually think to look at compatibility when I bought it, because it seems hard to find an electronic (especially in cameras) that isn't Mac friendly anymore, but here is me telling you that it is only Windows friendly natively. That said, I found the way to import my pictures from this camera into iPhoto from ehow. com that involves a few more steps, but for those who like "easy", the way almost everything is on a Mac, you may want to factor this into your decision if you are considering the Lumix.
