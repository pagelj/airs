I love the name, and the product makes a really good cup of coffee. Make it in the morning, and the carafe, still has it very warm for supper. Owned this coffeemaker before, and used it until it finally died-after years of use. Went right out and got another one, and it's as good as the first. Especially for the money, it's a very good coffeemaker.
