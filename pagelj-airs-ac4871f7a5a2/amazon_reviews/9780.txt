Support from Foscam (Calvin)
My new Fi8910W would re-boot when pointed at something in bright sunlight.  Foscam support was available by phone with a 2 minute wait.  After the initial screening questions the suggestions were do not use an extension cord, its is not an outdoor camera (true, it is not built for outdoor weather, but the web browser tool does have an 'outdoor' setting for viewing outdoors), your router must broadcast its SSID, and this will work only on wireless.  After this, Calvin took control of my system, changed my router to broadcast SSID and the camera worked.  He was helpful and courteous.  He was a pleasure to work with. He even took my browser to Amazon so I could do a feedback. The reason the SSID change fixed the problem was that it was getting dark and the IR cut filter no longer was being invoked and the camera was not re-booting. What finally fixed the problem was I simply rotated the lense 1/8 of a turn.  This must have loosened something (perhaps the mechanical IR cut filter) and the camera started working fine. I am now very pleased with its function, clarity and for keeping watch for critters in my garden the vivid colors are very helpful.  This camera is much better for viewing outdoors than prior Foscam camers without the IR cut filters.
