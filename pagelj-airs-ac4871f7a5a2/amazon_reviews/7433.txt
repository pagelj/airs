good video and probably fine as a bluray player, but not "universal" by any means
This player has great video quality. However, It has a poor GUI that seems to be divided into multiple apps and each one takes time to load. In addition it is very fussy about what audio files it chooses to play. I knocked off a star because it does not support surround sound from Amazon Prime. And no, it never will, Amazon does not support Panasonic.
