Remarkable
As a low-budget amateur film-maker, this recorder was a great discovery for me.  I use it with a flip camera, recording sound with the Flip and also with the Zoom.  The timing on the two is accurate enough that I can synch the Zoom sound with the Flip video in iMovie, and it stays synched longer than my typical clips.  Under good conditions, the Zoom can provide professional quality.  I find getting the volume high enough to catch full dynamic range without saturating is a little tricky.  Hand holding can introduce a little noise.  Wind is a problem.  It takes only one battery, which does not last long.
