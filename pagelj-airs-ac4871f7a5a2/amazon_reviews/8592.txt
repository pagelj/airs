Nice Story
Star Wanderers Outworlder  is a nice little story with a wide range of emotions running through our main character.  I did feel almost claustrophobic with the description of the space vessel they were traveling in.  I would have enjoyed the book more if it had contained more adventures out of the ship.  Perhaps in Mr. Vasicek's next book.
