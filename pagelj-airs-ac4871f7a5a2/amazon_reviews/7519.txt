Real camera!
Bought this for our 3 year old granddughter BUT the 6 year old granddaughter loves it. In fact, her father used it to take some pictures! After taking a picture you can select fun designs to add to the photo like crowns, hats, ears, etc. It is designed for small hands and survives falls!
