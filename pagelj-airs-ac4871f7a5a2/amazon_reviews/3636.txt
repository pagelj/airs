Seems to be Working Great
I decided to ensure that I bought a card that would have no issues with my new Panasonic HD-V500 Camcorder. I researched speeds and looked at a lot of reviews and on balance it seemed as if Sandisk was the safest bet. I researched speeds as it is confusing especially as Sandisk changed their definitions a few months back. Their Ultra cards are 30mbs and the Extreme cards are 45mbs. (Beware - you can find Extreme Video cards rated at 30mbs). I decided to spend a few $ more and ensure no lag delays and future proof myself. This is an Extreme 45mbs card with the new UHS 1 rating. It is extremely well priced at $1 per GB. (Costco has the 16GB version at $18). It works well in my camcorder. I noticed no lag or delays. Why look at anything else at this price? It is not worth it.
