Nice Product
The Dinerware came very well packaged and damage free. I bought it for every day use and have been following the manufacturers recommondations for cleaning w/ good results. I have a more expensive Onieda set for more formal use but would use this set to compliment it. This set is more Ornate in style for every day Dinerware use but it has good weight and a solid feel in each piece. I thought the price was fair and I got what I paid for. I would not purchase this product as a formal setting but used every day or in a buffet, it would be a good choice.
