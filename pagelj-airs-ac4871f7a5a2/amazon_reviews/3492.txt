SO. EFFING. GOOD
I cannot say how lazy I am when it comes to making breakfast. I hate it, I dread it, and I just can't stand it. This little gadget has saved me time in energy that I could use sleeping instead. The little sandwiches this baby makes are quick, easy and oh good. Def a well made and smart product. LOVE!
