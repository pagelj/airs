I bought this thinking it would be an upgrade to my plastic trash can.  It is however I am regretting not buying the larger rectangulartrash can b/c this one is not that large since it is has a narrow round shape.  This can cannot use regular grocery shopping bags since it is too tall and there is nothing to hold the bag up.  I use the tall kitchen bags from BJs.  Nice but I would have been happier with the rectangular one since that would allow me to fill up the entire trash bag.  This one is narrow so I feel like I am wasting a large bag with it. Quiet step close.  You can also keep the lid up if you pick it up manually.
