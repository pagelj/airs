Loved it!
I enjoyed this book very much. The hero is a great alpha male type, who is rich and used to issuing orders. The heroine is a smart lady, used to dealing with needy children. Her excellent perception of people's needs causes her to give this challenging male a chance in her life, though at first, she is very hesitant. They each learn more about themselves and family relationships, while exploring this new attraction to each other. Sexy but warm, you'll enjoy this e-book.
