Well worth the $12 dollars
You'll want to have a good quality tripod and a remote shutter release to use this product. Most photographers need these anyway, so it's no big deal. High quality Macro lenses cost hundreds of dollars. This extension allows you to use your existing lenses as Macro lenses for 12 bucks. This is perfect for the infrequent macro shooter or for someone who doesn't mind fiddling a bit to take macro shots. By fiddling, I mean this extension disconnects the auto-focus and F-stop adjustment because there are no lens contacts for these inside the extension. You have to set the f-stop where you want it before putting on this product and you'll need to focus manually once you have your shot composed. Very minor issues if your using a tripod, which is commonly used in macro photography anyway. The remote shutter release is recommended too. But, you can cheat by using the 2 second shutter release timer if you don't have one.
