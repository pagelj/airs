Cute and roomy enough
The Skip Hop Zoo Lunch bag looks just like the picture. It's adorable and practical. But expect no more. For a toddler preschooler it is roomy enough, 1 banana, 1 apple and 1 sandwich will fit in, but not much more than that. Both my daughter and I are happy with the purchase.
