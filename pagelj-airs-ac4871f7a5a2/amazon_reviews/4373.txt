I have enjoyed using this Oster microwave oven, partly because of the low price and also because it has done a great job cooking many types of food. The keypad is easy to push and operate, the glass carousel is a good size and the space for cooking is well laid out. It's not displeasing to look at either. At 1.1 cubic feet it is a decent sized unit and the price is refreshingly low.
