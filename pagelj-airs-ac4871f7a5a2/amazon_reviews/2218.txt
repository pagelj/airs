ok, I guess.
Sad to say I couldnt review this with accuracy until I found someone with a non-hd Kindle Fire. I didnt realize there WERE any around, the price difference being negligible. That said, it went on easy enough, but doesnt look like it'd survive a fall. I know its not a "case", but I couldnt get this to fit with any of the 4 cases she has. No case and cover combo works. They cant, or without a cover, the case would be loose.
