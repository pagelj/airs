RIP OFF CITY
I thought this would be a really good investment and thought it was very affordable. I bought a phone that tripled the minutes and time I bought through the parent company, but when it comes to the company charging back the minutes used... they charge four times the actual use. So not only is the whole thing a lie, but its a cheat too!!!!
