This Mr. coffee 4-cup switch coffee maker works great for me. It takes less than 5 minutes to make 4 cups of coffee; the 4 cups means small 4 coffee cups, so 2 mug cups of coffee if you use mug cups. I got Melitta's paper filters for 4 to 6 cups, and these fit perfectly. You might want to add a little bit of extra water when you make coffee because the filter and coffee absorb water, and coffee tastes bitter if you just add water to the line that coffee maker tells you. I add about a quarter of extra, and all kinds of coffee taste great so far!
