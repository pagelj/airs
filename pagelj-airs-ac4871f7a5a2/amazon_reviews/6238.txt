Giant capability from such a small box
This palm-sized device is a magical marvel. Set up is a breeze and the device has proven flawless since start up. Netflix streaming using the Roku 2 XD is a breeze and the picture quality is extraordinary; ditto for amazon prime instant videos. The device is easy to use and a true delight! My unit is located in the basement of my home, while my D-Link wi-fi router is on the second floor. The wi-fi connection has been flawless from the very start, with no detectable hiccups or mishaps with the connection. I didn't think Roku would wow me as much as it has, but I have to say I'm rather impressed by its overall performance. It's a true genie in a bottle!
