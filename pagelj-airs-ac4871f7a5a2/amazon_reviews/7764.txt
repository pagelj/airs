You get what you paid for...
This $20 cam is just that, a $20 cam.  It has a narrow field of view, it's 640x480 (not sure how this qualifies as 'HD'), and the recordings mine take have a repeating stutter to them.  There's also no option to flip the recording, so if you have to mount the camera upside down, your videos will all be upside down.  There's a repeating video glitch on the LCD screen which seems to coincide with the stutter, but it only seldom shows in the recorded video.  The mount is OK, and I appreciate that it uses a standard threaded camera mount. This means I can use other mounts with it. I don't think it was used, but it had the unmistakable smell of cigarette smoke to it. I didn't stick mine on the windshield because here in south Florida, the heat would just melt the thing in one day, so I used a weighted pad/mount on the dash, which means the camera is upside down (and so is the video.)  The AmazonBasics GPS Dashboard Mount works perfectly. This way I can take it and put it down on the floor out of the sun when I stop somewhere. It's easy in VLC to flip the video 180 when viewing, so it's not the end of the world.  Besides, once the novelty wears off, you won't be watching every video you take with it unless there's an event you want to see, like an accident. The other video modes (1920x1080, 1280x720) are just upsampled from 640x480, so for the best image quality use 640x480.
