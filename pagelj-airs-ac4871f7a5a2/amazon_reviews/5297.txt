A very good album
The four stars are because this album, although it is very good, it is not a masterpiece. Church of the machine, through the looking glass, the relic and lady of the snow are really masterpieces, but orion the hunter really is a let-down. it is still a good song, but not a Symphony X good song. Despite that, the album is great. Michael Romeo's guitars are excellent (specially the relic), Mike Pinniella's keyboards are awesome and Russell Allen's voice is just great. Thomas walling's drums are not as good as Jason Rullo's, but still good. Thomas Miller's bass I haven't heard very much, because I'm not into bass guitars, but the other Symphony X albums have great bass. Get it if you can!
