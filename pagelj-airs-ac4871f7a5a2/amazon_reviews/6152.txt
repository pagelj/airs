20 month old loves it!
1 1/2 yr old loves it! I originally purchased this about 4 months ago from another place. I then recently bought it again from amazon since we think our daughter left it somewhere. My daughter was 16 months old when it was originally bought and loved it. It was very easy for her to work everything and lightweight enough for her to carry around. We left this in our minivan as an alternative toy after she started throwing her books and needed something to occupy her time on longer drives. We love that it can be personalized to your kids name as well as emails can be personalized from mommy,daddy, or another relative or another persons name. With the one we just bought from amazon we put one of the emails "from" our daughters little brother. It is too cute! She always smiles when she hears she got an email from him. We also purchased a similar product from vtech which I have provided the amazon link for. Vtech Preschool Learning Tote and Go Laptop - 2010 VersionI believe that product is more for older kids so if you have a youger child this laptop would be better. Both products will continue to provide educational enjoyment for your child as they age, however the vtech product is more suited for older (it does say 3 and up on it)kids.
