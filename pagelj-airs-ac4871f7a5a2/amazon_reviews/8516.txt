3 faulty cables
I purchased 3 of these cables. I have a Xbox, PS3, WD TV Live Plus and my PC hooked through an Onkyo reciver and my TV. The xbox gets generally more use than the other devices. After 10 or so minutes of use, the screen would go black for a second or two and then came back; sometimes the audio would go out. And everytime this happened, the "HDMI" led from the receiver would start blinking. At firts i thought there was a handshake problem betwwen the xbox and the receiver and ran thru all the possible solutions google could provide to no avail. I switched the bluerigger cables and the problem persisted, then I decided to try the cable connected between the xbox and the receiver on the DirectTV box which is hooked directly to my TV. Three minutes passed and the image started cutting off so clearly the cable was the culprit of the problem. Since the cable used for the DirecTV was now placed between the xbox and the receiver, I decided to use a DIFFERENT bluerigger HDMI cable between the TV and the DirectTV box. After a while, the DirecTV signal went black and the pwer button started blinking, then the image came back but with a 480p resolution and everytime it was resetted to 1080p a loss of image and downgrade of resolution came by.  Decided to test that cable with my xbox and again 1-2 seconds of blackouts. Two faulty HDMI cables? I tried the third cable and after a while the same issue plagued the xbox and DirecTV box. Then I tried the three cables with the PS3 connected directly to the TV and the three cables failed. Did the same tests with the old cables I was using before the blueriggers and had no trouble at all. Why did I bought threee cables if I already had functional ones? Because I wanted a high speed cable to hook up my PS3 to my new Onkyo and opted to get three since the price was low. I cant imagine if this was a bad hatch but having 3 HDMI cables failing at the same time is unacceptable.
