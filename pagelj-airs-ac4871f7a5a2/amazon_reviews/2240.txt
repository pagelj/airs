Didn't work - defective one?
I was excited to get this after reading all the reviews, but unfortunately I have to give out only ONE star - wish I could give out ZERO star though. I charged it fully on Thursday. The coming Monday night, my daughter had to go to Emergency Room so I brought my "out of battery" iPod and New Trent to ER hoping the music would calm her down - it usually does. I hooked New Trent on to my iPod and turn it on. The blue light stayed on for about 10 seconds then it went off. I tried several times and the blue light never stayed on and of course my iPod was still "out of battery" :(I thought maybe it was charged 3-4 days ago and maybe the "ON" button was pressed while it was stored in my purse. So I charged it fully again - it took less than 1 minute to have it fully charged this time. I tried connecting it to my iPod again. Same thing happened. I pressed the ON button and the blue light indicated that it was fully charged. Then the blue light went off within 10 seconds. I tried several times and finally gave up. I guess I just got a defective one....
