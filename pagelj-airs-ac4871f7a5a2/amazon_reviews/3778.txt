Kingston 8 GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SDC4/8GB
I got the the Kingston 8 GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SDC4/8GB on time as promised 2-3 days.  So far I have no problem with the micro cards other than it's slow (It would be better off spending a little more and spend on a class 10 instead, I think it would be worth the price).  I would rate the cards 3 out of 5 stars for prompt service and I got what I paid for.
