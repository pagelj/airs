Great Everyday Camera Bag
While I own several camera bags, from the Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras (Black with Green Accent) to the tiny ones, this one Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG is just right for my every day use.  It's not big and bulky or heavy and I can carry just the lenses I need. I can fit two lenses, one with the hood on backwards and the camera with an 85mm lens with the hood backwards.  I fit the remote control on the inside pocket and cleaning cloths and on the outside zipper pocket I fit the external flash.  I have a little bit of everything I may need on a quick trip to the park with my kids without it being big and heavy.  The quality of this bag is the best! The zipper on top and on the front pocket makes is perfect at not worrying about my lenses falling out and the metal clip is perfect for a quick close between lens changes. Overall, I am very happy with this bag.  The size, the quality and how it feels carrying it around.  If you have lots of equipment to carry then you will need a bigger size but for two or three lenses on quick every day trips, this is the one to use.  I love it and I know you will too. :)
