Amazing Telephoto...
I would not suggest the 67 mm adaptor and filters as they don't fit well and are hard to get on and off. I returned this part of the order. I bought some 58mm from lensmateonline  that work great! Both the filters, adaptor, new lens cap and flare cover. I also love the Megagear leather cover as the bottom gives you a good grip on this camera more like a NIKON would have. The camera is just plain amazing with what it can do with the telephoto!!!!  Since I bought mine, many friends also got one. Several of us had other cameras. I like my NIKON D-80 with 18-200 VR lens but it just doesn't get out there like this one. Plus this one would be LIGHT to carry in situations like my Africa trip... and give you the ZOOM to reach out an touch animals you really don't want to touch, ha..
