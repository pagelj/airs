Best backpack for price!
This backpack came much earlier than I had expected, as most everything from Amazon seems to arrive earlier than expected! I have now used this back for over 1 month, and am very happy with its performance thus far. On the description, I believe it talks about the "Suspension Strap System". At the time, I didn't have any idea what that was, so I will take the liberty of describing it. The Suspension Strap System is about a 1" section of stretchy material on both straps that sits on the collar/shoulders. As you add weight to your bag, the suspension straps work by alleviating some of that weight. It really works! I have five classes, and I can definitely say my back and shoulders hurt less by using this bag. All-in-all, great product and a GREAT price. I would highly recommend this product to any college student looking for a heavy-duty backpack.
