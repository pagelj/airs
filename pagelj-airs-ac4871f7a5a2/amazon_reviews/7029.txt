A fascinating book...
A very good book.  I found Ender's psychological stress to be very  realistic, and truly felt for him. There are only two problems with this book.  First of all, Mr. Card, you fail to distinguish between intellegence and creativity (creative people tend to have higher than average IQs, of about 120, but many geniuses lack creativity, and vice versa), although Ender was obviously both (which does sometimes happen). The other problem is that the genius strategies are mostly limited by the fact that the author is NOT a genius.  They're not dumb, they're intellegent, but when you have an entire battle school of geniuses at work I believe you'd do better than "in space any direction can be up". Beyond that, the book is pure classic.
