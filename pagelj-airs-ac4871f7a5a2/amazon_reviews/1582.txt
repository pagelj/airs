Let's see, at about $4 a latte, we've already saved nearly $800.  Okay, not really, because we wouldn't have hit up the local coffee shop quite as often as we make our own lattes, but you get the point. This machine is awesome!  My wife and I are huge coffee/espresso drinkers and this thing has been amazing.  We've had it for about 4 months.  We live in the coffee capital (Seattle), and the lattes that come out of the EC155 rival many of the local shops.  Because we make lattes almost exclusively, I can't comment on how just a plain espresso tastes.  I don't know if the milk helps mask any deficiency in taste.  What I do know is the EC155 makes latte making quick and easy, and the result is delicious and cheap. I won't go into all the details since many others have covered them.  Yes, the wand is small, but we leave the EC155 by the edge of the counter leaving plenty of room for frothing (if you don't know how to properly froth, google it - the first few days I just had warm milk).  Buy a tamper, trust me - the one on Amazon with two sides works perfectly.  You need small cups to fit under the pour spouts.  You can use shot glasses or espresso cups with the grate in place, or remove the grate an use a slightly larger cup.  Many claim there's a big difference in taste when letting the machine heat up for 15 minutes.  Can't say I've noticed it, but I generally turn the machine on before I cook breakfast and make the espresso after just in case. Bottom line: for less than $100, you can't go wrong with the EC155.  There will never be a day one of these isn't in my home.
