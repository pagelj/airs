This is a sweet bang for the buck!
I recently upgraded to the S2940 (Walmart sells the S2950 in their stores as the S2940), after using a Nikon Coolpix S570 for about a year. At this time, the price difference between my old Nikon and the new Fuji is around $30, and let me say that it is worth every penny and then some. The Fuji takes such better quality pictures, from low light to bright sunny light, and the video is drastically better because it's 720 high definition. All the features that you get are so much more useful and you actually will use them. At least I seem to. :O) The reason why I am comparing my old and new camera, is so when you read this little blurb, it will make you think twice about not investing a little more money into the camera. You'll get a noticable jump up in picture and video quality, plus getting some nice usable features that work well. Normal "point and shoot" cameras are decent and simple to use if you are a teenager or a great-grandparent, but point and shoot is just.... point and shoot. Thanks for reading!
