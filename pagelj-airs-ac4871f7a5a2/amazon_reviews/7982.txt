One of the best books I have read this year!
5 stars! I am at a loss for words, but sometimes a few words are worth more than a million. This is not a traditional review, this is more about me sharing my feelings. It's the first time I have cried so much with a book and I loved every minute of it. I knew this was going to be an emotional journey and I embraced it with all of my heart and cried for Colton and Nell and for the people I have lost too."He doesn't fix me, doesn't heal me. He just makes life worthwhile."This is a beautiful book that brings hope to the people that think there's no light in this world, that feel they are not worth it and that happiness is just a dream. In honesty it all comes down to that, bringing light into the darkness and this book is a shining star. So thank you Jasinda for writing such an inspirational story and for being a ray of light. I will never forget Nell or Colton, they'll always be in my heart. Favorite quotes:"I don't want it to get easier.""Why?""Because if it get's easier... I'll forget him.""Only you. The good and the bad. All you, all beautiful.""I'm thinking this is the best moment of my life. Honestly. I feel closer to you right now that anyone... ever. I'm thinking... I want to experience moments likes this with you forever.""I'm not just falling in love with you, Nell. I'm falling into you.""I realize I'll always miss Kyle, and a part of me will always feel guilty for just being alive when he isn't, and that's something I'll just have to live with."
