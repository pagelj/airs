Works well and seems to be of good quality
Holds my knives well.  My only complaint is the anchors that come with it to secure it in the wall, don't work.  They don't expand in the wall.  I had some other anchors that I used and had not problems.  This could be an issue for those not installing into wood and without alternative anchors.
