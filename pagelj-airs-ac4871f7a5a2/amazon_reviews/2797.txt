Great monitor, but interferes with wifi
I've had the monitor for almost a year now, and it works great!  I even bought a 2nd add on camera to see my girls entire room, not just her crib.  That being said, I want to warn you that this may interfer with your wifi.  We have Verizon FIOS and couldn't figure out for the longest time why our phones and ipad would not get a good wifi connection all the time.  We now know its this monitor.  It's very frustrating because I'm not going to quite using the monitor.  Just thought buyers should be aware.
