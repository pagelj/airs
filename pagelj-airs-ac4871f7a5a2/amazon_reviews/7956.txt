Nifty
Bought this for my wife. So far from the one peicer to this the quality of talking over a blue tooth has definetly improved. No where near the static, echos or background noise from my one piece and I can actually hear her when shes talking to me. Not having to ask her what every couple of minutes is nice. Plus it doubles as a fancy head set which is nice for running with out wires getting ripped out by my hand.
