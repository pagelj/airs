Fun Ride with Twists and Turns
Rarely do I completely miss a "surprise" ending before it barrels down on me, but I didn't see this one coming.  A tad too much AI & hacker detail for me, but that didn't get in the way of my read overly much.  I like speculative fiction.  I enjoy writers with imagination who take me for a "what if" ride that helps me ponder the specifics of human existence through twists that I have not yet previously considered.  Good Job, David K.
