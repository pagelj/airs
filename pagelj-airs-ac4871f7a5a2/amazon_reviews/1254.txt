Cheap price cheap quality
You get what you pay for. This thing looked cheap in the pictures and it feels cheap now that I got it but it seems to work just fine. It is nicely small and light weight and the price can't be beat. I'll have to see how it holds up in the long run but it seems to be OK thus far. Go ahead and buy it so long as you do not have high expectations. Like I said, you can't beat the price but you get what you pay for.
