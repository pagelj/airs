Exceptional
As many reviewers have noted, Cline draws inspiration from Neal Stephenson's Snowcrash and William Gibson's Neuromancer novels, but Ready Player One is not really derivative.  It's an update to the canon of cyberpunk fiction; although you don't have to be a fan of this genre to enjoy this superbly written epic adventure. The novel is prescient about the (largely dystopic) future, where people turn away from the increasingly dismal real world and immerse themselves in a multi-player simulation world called OASIS; but it is also steeped in references to 70s and 80s culture that gave rise to computer programming; video, board and roll-play gaming and design; new wave and heavy metal music and geek-as-chic aesthetics.  Oh, and the notion that corporations are pure evil. I won't go into many details, because so many reviewers have already covered that ground, but suffice it to say that Ready Player One is fast-paced, thought-provoking, impressive in its detail about new technology and, as I mentioned before, 70s and 80s culture.  Cline captures cyber culture in its every nuance, and he incisively projects where our current cultural, technological, political and financial trends could take us. An exciting, beautifully detailed, sometimes harrowing book, Ready Player One is one of the best books of the last few years.  If you like authors like Philip K. Dick, Neal Stephenson and Daniel Suarez, you'll love Ernest Cline.  Highly recommended!
