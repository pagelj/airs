Works well
I bought this high speed device because I read where the speed was needed for the full HD video and the high speed picture burst mode that my Canon SX40HS camera would record.  However I haven't taken any of this type of images as yet so I can't say how well it performs.  However the memory device is working fine and does transfer images quickly to my computer.
