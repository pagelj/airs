Pricy but works like a charm
Just slipped this case on my Paperwhite and I'm pleased. I would have been a bit more pleased if it was $25 but for a leather cover ... could be worse I guess. It adds VERY LITTLE bulk to the unit. I will be using this like my other Kindle in traveling overseas ... planes, buses, taxis ... and I need it to be protected. I need to be able to quickly close it up and slip it back in my messenger bag without worrying it'll get scratched up or broken. This provides that. I've read other people complain about weight. So I was a bit worried till I got it. It only adds exactly 4.5 oz to a 7.35 oz unit. That's still only 11.85 oz's and that's not much for traveling. Not when you consider the protection, the instant on feature and how it feels in your hand. The plastic tray that the unit sits in is coverd on the back with the leather and the edge of the tray has that same rubberised material that back of the Kindle has. Another benefit is the lack of finger prints all over the back of the unit. You don't get it with the cover. So I'm not constantly wiping it down. Regarding the instant on feature. If you have the thing completely powered off (white screen)and close the flap ... upon opening it the unit powers up. Close it again and upon opening it up you'll notice it's in the standby mode with the screen saver picture showing. So to power it off for flights you'll have to actually use the button to power it off before closing and stowing. No biggie ... I've enjoyed the magnetic flap instant on feature of my iPad ... so I was really happy to see it on the Paperwhite. Most excellent ... now Amazon ... work on that pricing!
