Poor Reception Qualities
The triple minutes for life was what grabbed my attention, but I also had a good experience with my 1st Tracfone, a Motorola basic flip-open model that I started with. Unfortunately, the LG800G has not been anything close to a good experience. I added a micro-SD card and a Bluetooth adaptor to my laptop to enhance the phone's utility. The phone has simply been very undependable. I get "Emergency Calls Only" and "Service Unavailable" messages quite often. Every call is usually dropped almost immediately and has to be re-dialed. Reception is completely inadequate - the other party repeatedly has to ask what I said due to the dropouts. Triple minutes has been no bargain with this phone. I will have to dig out my receipt and see if there's any kind of warranty or repair service available - or just start all over with another phone.
