Never again...
No view-finder. Mediocre lens (Though Nikon touts it as a Nikkor lens. They shouldn't be too proud of this one.) Smart focus not very 'smart' at all (A lot of my photos are taken along the Atlantic Ocean shore and smart focus cannot focus on the horizon of the ocean. Only the landscape mode will.) Most photos 'washed out.' And who really needs all these silly modes? I would have gladly given them all up for a decent lens and a view-finder. If I pop-up the flash, I expect a flash in any mode, but not with this camera. I paid full retail at $280.00; I easily paid that much for what should be at most a $100.00 camera. This was my first Nikon, and it is my last Nikon. Never again. It's back to Canon for me.
