Fantastic
After reading the pre-reviews of others, I had decided to wait for a future release before buying this movie. I glad that I didn't! This is by far the best release that I have seen in Blu-Ray. The picture quality is far superior to any other Blu-ray release that I have screened on my system. It is truly motion picture quality (of course, not in 3-D). The soundtrack is 5.1, but you won't be disappointed even if you have a 7.1 system. The sound is pure, and discreet with excellent separation without sounding contrived. Honestly, I was stunned after watching (and listening) to Avatar in Blu-Ray. You may have to upgrade the firmware in your DVD player to play this release. I have a Samsung BDP3600 Blu-ray Player purchased this past fall and I still had to upgrade the firmware. The movie takes a long time to load, longer than other titles I own, but after it does... WOW. I haven't looked at the second disc of extras (not Blu-Ray). Will report back when I do. But for now, this is a MUST BUY, if you are into Blu-Ray, home theater, surround sound and of course the movie, Avatar!
