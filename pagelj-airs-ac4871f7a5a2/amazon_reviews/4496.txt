This was a great coffee machine for us for about three months. Then the coffee side of the machine died in mid-brew for no apparent reason. We used it to make a full pot every morning and most nights seven days a week. If you consume lots of coffee at home this might not be the best machine to buy. For the record, we normally get about a year out of a coffee machine before we have to replace it.
