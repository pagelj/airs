Burned to a crisp
Oster 6307 Inspire 2-Slice Toaster, RedWhy is it that we can send a man to the moon, but can't build a reliable toaster? The item I purchased was as follows:PRO:  Beautiful red color, reasonable construction and packaging.  Plenty of room in the slots for bagels or thick-sliced bread.  Nice row of indicator lights. CON:  Performance was terrible.  From the mid-point on the dial down to the number 2 setting, one side of the bread was brown and the other assorted shades of black.  The lowest number produced nothing.  I wearied of wasting bread and returned the toaster. Based on other user reviews, quality-control is very inconsistent-you may get a good one, then again, you may not.  Hope you fare better than we did.
