Two Words: Roku Rocks!
Well a few months back we decided we were sick of paying for cable TV. Tired of having to get a bigger channel package just so we can get the 10 channels we actually do watch on a regular basis. If we want movie channels included forget it, your bill goes up to over $100 a month. So we decided to cut the "cable" umbilical cord. We started using our Wii to stream. At first it did a decent job then things starting going down hill. It would take forever to load and would buffer several times during a show that is if we could get the program to load in the first place. Not to mention navigating video selections with the Wii remote is a huge pain in the butt and forget about trying to stream on Sunday nights with the Wii and everyone in the neighborhood creating high traffic on the WiFi connection. So we started watching TV on our tablets instead,leaving our fantastic 50" HDTV Flat Screen to go unused. So I decided to start doing some research on a good streaming device. I came across the Roku on Amazon and thought we will give it a whirl. Wow we are over the moon about this thing! Streaming Amazon Videos & Netflix is a snap. Loads so fast and never gets interrupted [no more buffering or long delays here!] even on a busy Sunday evening. Pausing, rewinding, fast forward is a breeze! No delay when resuming to play mode. Search mode is amazing. You can search all of the channels for a single show/movie you want to watch and Roku will check all the channels and show the different prices. The remote is great and even comes with ear buds so a single individual can listen without disrupting others. The Roku has a very cool phone app that turns your mobile phone into an extra remote and it works seamlessly! This player gets two giant thumbs up, as good as it gets,... goodbye Cable T. V., Hello Roku 3!
