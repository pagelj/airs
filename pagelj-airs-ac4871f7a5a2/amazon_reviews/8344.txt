DEFECTIVELY DESIGNED CHARGER CONNECTOR
We purchase this Dec. 2011 and my 9 yr old LOVED it. HOWEVER, there appears to be a design FLAW in which the receptacle in the Kindle Fire will eventually come lose and not allow the Kindle cord to stay connected to charge UNLESS you PERFECTLY set the connection, which will take 5+ minutes AND it does NOT come lose on it's on (which it will based on the lose connection and wait of the cord/connector). WE tried EVERYTHING and even had a new one sent to us under the warranty, but to no avail. Several of our friends say they have the same problem. This is VERY frustrating for our 9 yr old and us. AMAZON... are you reading this?  THEIR IS A DEFECT WITH THE DESIGN BETWEEN THE USB CONNECTION PORT AND THE CORD.
