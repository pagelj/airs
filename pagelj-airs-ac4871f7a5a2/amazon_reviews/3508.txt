works great
Worked right away, includes mini and micro adapters, with my particular tablet (Novo Elf II) bluetooth wasnt an option, so this keyboard/case/stand was an easy choice.  Three "clips", two on lower edge, third spring loaded one on upper edge, hold tablet in place, when open, but when closed, as you carry it, tablet easily falls out. Id give it a fifth star if clips had a non slip surface AND there were more space for the full sized USB connector to fit in case when closed.  Still, well worth the price.
