It's about time....
I can now bang out an awesome breakfast within the confines of a toaster.  No more oven, pans, lids, skillets, spatulas, etc to leave behind in the sink and get yelled at for not cleaning.... thank you super toaster. I love it.  I would give it 6 stars they day they add a little bacon terrace to go with the egg balcony... now that would be amazing.
