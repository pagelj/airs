My first TV mount for 58" Samsung Plasma
i have this mount for my 58" ultra thin Samsung Plasma. I am very happy with it. Install was swift. This mount is is sturdy enough so I trust it to hold my Sammy worth 2 grand. Bubble level is a good addition. They also shipped me a bubble bar separately. Trust me, it comes in handy for TV mount install. Otherwise, you would end up hanging your TV crooked. The mount also tilts down enough that I am satisfied with the view. I have my TV about 4-5 feet from the ground on the mount. The mount comes with 4 hardcore bolts. I had 2 installed on each studs per instruction. The spacing between the studs in my wall is like 20" or more, but definitely not 16. You can always buy more bolts from Home Depot. I believe the mount has enough holes in it and is wide enough to accommodate 3 studs 16" apart (6 bolts needed).  For those buying this mount, make sure you use stud finder. Dont stick the bolts in dry wall. I used this stud finder from home depot for $20 and works great: Zircon E50.
