Phenomenal!
This weather radio is perfect for emergencies! It feels strong and robust. It is packed with a great manual teaching you everything you need to know. It is packed with every adapter you need for anything you want to charge! The flashlight is bright, the radio has great connection, the solar panel works surprisingly well and cranking for 1 minute equals 70 minutes of flashlight. EFFICIENT! Buying this radio is a no-brainer. You won't regret it. I am going to buy 2 more for my wife's car and mine. Awesome!
