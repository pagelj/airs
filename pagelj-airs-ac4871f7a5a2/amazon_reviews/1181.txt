I am on my second Grind and Brew and am ready to purchase a spare.  I love this product.  I clean it each night before bed, fill with water and beans, and set the timer.  I had my first one for a few years, and have had this one for about 4 years. I like strong coffee, and when I use the correct amount of beans I get it!  I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this pot.
