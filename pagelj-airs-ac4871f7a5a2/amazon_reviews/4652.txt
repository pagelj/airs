I Hate This Phone
Android is great, but after 7 months of ownership words cannot express how much I hate this phone.  The reception is terrible--my wife reliably gets a signal on her little throw-away when I cannot on this phone.  The screen is unreadable even in the shade if it's daylight--you have to be indoors.  The rotate screen function is entirely unreliably.  You cannot zoom into the screen except on a few apps, and the font for some apps, such as Contacts, is miniscule.
