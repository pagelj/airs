it's a very easy using stuff. Without the help of my husband, I can put it together and clean it after using. Clean quite well for my small apartment. I love it! Except it's a little bit heavy for one hand, still needs two hands all the time which is a little bit inconvinient when u need to move a chair or sth. But good over all.
