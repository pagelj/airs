Great for Feral Cats Too!
We have a baby on the way.  We also have a dog and 4 cats, one of which is feral.  All the cats are indoor only... even the feral one!  It's awesome to actually know what she does when we are not upstairs where she lives!  Long story short, it works great and the price is good.  The volume is weak, but it's hard to expect better video for the price.
