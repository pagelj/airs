After reading the other reviews, I was afraid this oven was going to be way too big for my needs but it's fine; fits nicely on the same cart as the microwave I replaced (also a Panasonic and lasted over ten years)which was quite a bit smaller. I was tired of the black and woodgrain so ordered the white one and it's nice. Also, I always choose the super saver free shipping when available; this arrived three days after I ordered. I like the way the door operates and the functions are easy to understand. I don't use popcorn in a bag. I make my own and haven't tried that yet. Reading the candid customer reviews on Amazon really helps me make a choice in selecting products. The price of this oven went up $11 the day after I bought it! I'm completely satisfied with my purchase.
