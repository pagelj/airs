Idiotic spacefarers and stuff
I am through 32 % of the book, but already, two different set of space explorers have acted like school kids. The female interest, after starting off as a potentially serious space explorer, soon turns out to be a teenager who has a fancy for beautiful things on strange planets. Others are no better either, and obeying the Captain's orders come difficult to them. If you have watched the movie Prometheus, you would understand as so-called scientists act like they are on a picnic. Sad, because the plot so far looks interesting, but the character development is only getting worse. It is a bit like watching a horror movie, where everyone in the movie goes running towards danger.
