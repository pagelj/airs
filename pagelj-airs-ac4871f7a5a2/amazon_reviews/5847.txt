Fast Router, Good interface, Superior wifi speed and range
This is the best router I've owned.  It's got great range and the best of both worlds because it has open source firmware so if you want to use 3rd party firmware like Merlin, you can get more features and get the benefit of 3rd party firmware using the best drivers for the Broadcom Chipset.  Often 3rd party open source firmware doesn't have the benefit of using the same drivers as the manufacture uses.  I've also noticed Asus has incorporated lessons learned from the 3rd party firmware into their firmware updates so they are making good incremental improvements to the routers stock firmware. The routers web interface responds very quickly.  I haven't found a single desired feature missing from this router.  I think Asus beefed up it's hardware compared to other wifi routers and they incorporated features and tweaks of 3rd party open source firmware to make a router that has it all... great firmware and hardware. The 5Ghz band doesn't seem to work as good as the 2.4Ghz band, that's my only complaint.  But I used to use a Cisco Linksys router that had similar problems with 5Ghz.  Basically connections drop on 5Ghz even at close range.
