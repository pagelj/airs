Great Camera in the Making
Picture Quality:Good - Supports up to 640x480. Probably can not make out a license plate number or get a great shot of someones face, but it will do okay for general surveillance. Sharpness is OK and can be fine tuned on the lens. Product Features:I must say, these guys did a really good job with the functionality of this camera. The manual included on the disk is pretty clear and easy to understand. The software seems to work pretty well. The iphone app also works well, although it really depends on your internet connection. I did not try the built in DDNS service but I had zero problems setting up the camera on a third party dynamic dns service. Problems:The vertical panning function has broken after 2 days. The motor can be heard just spinning but not moving the camera. The horizontal panning still works well. I am not super concerned about the vertical pan so I do not plan on having it replaced just yet. Additional Information:Since this is going to be used for surveillance, I needed a much longer power cable. The barrel connector is "Type H" and can be found at radioshack. The power source required to the camera is 1.5 amps @ 5v. I ended up making a new power cable which I can run out to my porch. Camera is not advertised for outdoor use, so even though it is protected from the elements, I am not sure how it will hold up.
