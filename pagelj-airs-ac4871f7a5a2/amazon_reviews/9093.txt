I felt compelled to leave a review because I LOVE this machine! However with 2,190 reviews ahead of mine, there isn't much I could add. Hope this helps someone... I will say it's absolutely amazing how well it cleans. I did follow another review's advice and only used Oxy Clean and water. It was crazy to watch how dirty the water came out over and over.  We had stains in the carpet from several years before, and even a spot that appeared to be a tar type substance came out. I uploaded some before and after photos on the main product page. I would recommend taking pictures. It's so truly amazing how clean the carpets get that the pictures help you realize and appreciate the difference. Totally worth the money! I would highly recommend it.
