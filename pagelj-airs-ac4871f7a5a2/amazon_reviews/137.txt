Do not buy this product
I bought this product thinking I was getting a keyboard for my kindle fire and boy was I disappointed. There is currently no supported keyboard for the fire so don't waste your money. The case also does not secure your kindle, as mine has slid out on several occasions and I have had the product for less than a week. If you want a case that contains a useless keyboard and will drop you kindle then this is the case for you. If you value you kindle investment then this is not the product to buy.
