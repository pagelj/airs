Sturdy and functional
I wanted a backpack to use for when I travel to carry all my essentials in. I usually use a large tote bag but it's a pain because it either slides down my shoulder or I have to carry it along with other things. I wanted a backpack that was not too large but also made of a strong material that wouldn't fall apart in a year. This backpack is perfect sized for what I need and it's made from a good quality canvas. It also has multiple pockets and I love the the extra side pocket that conveniently holds my Nalgene. It's large enough to carry important thing like my wallet and passport along with my phone, extra charger and my netbook and there it plenty of leftover room for the extra odds and ends. I also love the color and simple design. I am a girl, but I am not into those glitzy overly colorful bags that look like a rainbow threw up. Highly recommend it.
