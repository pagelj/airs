light and stylish
Of course this is subjective but compared to the original design of the 40-150mm (non 'R' designation) this lens looks stunning, with its all black color and redesigned zoom ring. It has a much better textured grip on the zoom ring. The zoom friction and manual focus ring are pretty much the same: zoom is not too stiff, not too loose. MF ring is very smooth. pros:-decent to great image quality for a zoom-very light and compact-modestly pricedcons:-plastic mount (a major letdown and it almost prevented me from buying this, but there really is no alternative, size/weight/cost-wise). I would personally prefer a metal mount even if it adds a few extra grams.-feels plasticky and a little cheap
