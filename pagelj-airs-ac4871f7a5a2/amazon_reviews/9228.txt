Classic for a reason.
To an avid reader this book is a nightmare. This is a world where firemen come to burn books because they are illegal. Guy Montag, a fireman, starts to question everything when one girl asks him a simple question. - "Are you happy?" Thought provoking and beautifully written, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic for a reason. Showcasing the disadvantages to censorship, it makes me glad to live in a world where we can read and enjoy what we choose.
