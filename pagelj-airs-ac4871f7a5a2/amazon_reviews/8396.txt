Going to be a great series!
I got this book as a freebie a while back and actually forgot about it.  I started reading it this weekend and was impressed.  It is a hot little short. I would have liked to know what transpired with his son.  I may read more about him in the series.  I am starting the next book now.  Looking forward to reading more of Liliana's books!
