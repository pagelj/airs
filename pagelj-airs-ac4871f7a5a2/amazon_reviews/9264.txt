Not Bad
I would highly recommend this laptop if you need something that is:-small and compact-cheap-has the basics that will let you write up a document, surf the web, and check e-mail.-long battery lifeCons:-Netflix and YouTube isn't that smooth. It's safe to say this shouldn't be your go-to media platform.-a little on the slow side when it comes to startup and load times for apps. In other words, I wouldn't get this laptop if you expect speed to be an important factor.
