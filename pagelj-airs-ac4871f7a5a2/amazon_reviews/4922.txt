Great Player at Great Price
I bought this to replace a Sony Blu-ray (not 3D) player which I grew frustrated with. Basics: the unit itself looks good, however, I find its little display too dim to read behind its smoked cover from my usual viewing distance.. not a big deal.  Discs load quickly... much quicker than the Sony it replaced. The remote control is much more intuitive than the old unit's. The picture and sound quality through my home theater system are excellent, better than the old unit. Extras: The built in WiFi is  easy to set up and really cool. Since I don't have a "Smart" TV, this player provides the internet services. The built in WiFi also makes firmware updates a snap. It recognizes my laptops, pc, and smart phones and displays their photos in HD on the big screen and can play their music all without wired connections.... cool. However, I can't get the cellphone remote control app to work. I might need the next generation phone. It's also very convenient to simply plug in a USB thumb drive into the front of the player to see the photos on the big screen or play the music on it through my surround system.3D:  I don't have 3D capability with my TV to comment on this feature. I definitely recommend this player.
