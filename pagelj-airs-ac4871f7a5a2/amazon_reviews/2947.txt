Cute bag, but didn't work for me
I purchased this bag for work to put my laptop in it.  It fit my laptop, but the bottom of the bag was very thin and would not protect my laptop from being damaged.  I also thought the handles would be a little longer, but unfortunately they were too short to easily put the bag on my arm if I had a winter coat on.  Very cute bag, but would not work for what I needed so I had to return it.
