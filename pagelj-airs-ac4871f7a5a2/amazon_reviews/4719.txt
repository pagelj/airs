Not a review of the product itself, but if anyone is shopping for a small coffee maker with a longer auto shutoff time, keep shopping!  I've been looking in vain for a 4 to 5 cup drip coffee maker with at least a 2 hour automatic shutoff.  I thought I'd finally found one! Amazon's description says, "2-hour automatic shut-off for safety"I received the shipment today, opened the box and saw that it says 1 hour automatic shutoff.  So, I closed up the box and requested a refund.  Disappointed because reviews of the coffeemaker have been so good.
