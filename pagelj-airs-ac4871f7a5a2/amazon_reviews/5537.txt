Otterbox For Kindle Fire
I just received the cover and have to say wow.  At first glance the screen protector looks like it isn't worth anything, but once its all assembled its not flimsy feeling.  I would advise to be careful when pull the peices apart so you can start to put it on your device.  Once the cover/case is on the fire, it fits like a glove.  The stand part of the case, to me feels like it might fall off, but that's easily taken off when not in use.  Overall its easy to assemble.  Its comes per-assembled all you have to do is take it apart and put it on the kindle.
