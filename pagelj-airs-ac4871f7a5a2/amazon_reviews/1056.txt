Awesome pictures
We first bought a $100 digital camera, it was good, but wanted something a little more.  When comparing these pictures to the other, our daughter just pops right out of the picture.  We can not believe what great pictures they are.  I can use the camera as a point and shoot and my husband can use all of the controls and make the picture what he would like it to look like.  We love it!
