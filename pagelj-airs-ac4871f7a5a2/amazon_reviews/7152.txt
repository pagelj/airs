Not that good
This stuff is a petroleum based product. I used it a few times on my Jaguar seats and it did nothing. I followed instructions and allowed it to soak into the seats and did this for months with no change in the condition of the leather. I guess it depends on the leather. Mine is top grade leather and I guess it only works on lesser grades of leather. I tried a preservation quality conditioner from another company (expensive stuff) and it worked very well.
