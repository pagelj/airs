Just got it today and it works great and looks great.  It is quiet and it's keeping my dogs out of the trash, even though they figured out how to open it, it makes them uncomfortable that it opens and closes by itself.  The opening is not as easy for them to stick their noses into as it is a little taller and narrower than the previous trash cans we have had.  My dogs are smart, they can open doors and get into child proof cabinets but so far this little can is keeping them out of the trash.  13 gallon trash bags fit perfectly in this little unit.  It was delivered timely and undamaged.
