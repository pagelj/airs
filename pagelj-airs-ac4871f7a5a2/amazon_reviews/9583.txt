Not too good:(
I like the phone but I'm having problems making calls... every time I make a call or receive call it always blink/flashes and its really hard to touch the screen to answer or hung up. I bought this phone for me and 6.0" FWVGA Screen MTK6577 Dual Core 1.2GHz Android 4.0 3G Smart Phone N9776 for my husband. well it seems like my husband was having the same problems on his phone too it keeps flashing and its really annoying because We both sometimes get important phone calls from our job or family members and it really hard to answer when the screen is flashing. We both regret buying these phone, its not even worth the money. oh and the battery don't even last an hour I have to charge it every chance I get. The keyboard is very small its very hard to text/type mesg I have to redo redo redo OMG I just want to break this phone already!!!
