Roku Rocks!
I got the Roku for my mom last week, who loves Netflix but doesn't have a PS3/Wii/Xbox to stream from to her TV (for obvious reasons).  I set it up for her, sat with her for about 5 minutes and flipped through the menu with her, and then left her to it.  I called her today and she said "I was supposed to go do some work today, but I just got hooked watching movies all day long".  She loves it, she finds it very easy to use (yay!), it's super small and cute, it's totally intuitive, and now my mom can finally get the full benefit of Netflix (especially considering they just hiked their prices up!). My only "gripe" is the box says it sets up in 6 minutes.  This is far from true... it took me about 35 minutes.  The Roku had to download an update, install the update, then it spit out a code which you have to enter via a computer on the website, then create a Roku account, etc.  It wasn't difficult, don't get me wrong, just be prepared to spend longer than 6 minutes!  My expectations should have been set differently, and then it wouldn't have even been an issue. Overall though, very happy, and very relieved my mom is happy with it too.  The fact that she finds it easy to use and is shirking her to-do list to watch movies instead is a testament to how cool this little thing is! :)  She's also very excited about the fact that Angry Birds is on it, because now the grandkids will have something to play when they come over (although I'm still trying to get her to play it too! ;)
