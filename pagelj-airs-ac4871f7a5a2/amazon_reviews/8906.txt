Hyperion deserved that Hugo
_Hyperion_ was a really fun read. I didn't know what to expect, but it was much more of a character study of six of the pilgrims much more than an action book, although there certainly was enough of that to keep one interested. It's divided up into six different novellas, with each of the different characters telling their story of why they've been selected for this final pilgrimage to the Time Tombs. At first, _Hyperion_ felt incredibly familiar to me, even though this was my first time with it. The reason that it is so familiar is because Simmons pays quite a bit of homage to several prominent literary artists. Hyperion's format is strongly reminiscent of Chaucer's The Cantebury Tales, but on an alien planet, of course. John Keats, author of the original (and unfinished) epic poem, _Hyperion_, plays a pretty large role. The capital of the planet is named after him and one of the characters has a very special relationship with Keats. There is quite a bit of language in _Hyperion_, which I found a bit disappointing, but overall I think the book is great and really presents some very interesting ideas about time travel, religion, politics, and literature (there's also a nice tip of the hat to Norse mythology). I'm highly looking forward to getting my grubby little hands on the rest of the series.
