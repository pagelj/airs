Cuisinart TOB-155 Toaster Oven
I annoyed my wife by buying this toaster oven because of the counter space it takes up, but after making a spot for it she has been using it lately and seems to like it now. After having this for a month, it seems to work really well.  It cooks bagels, waffles, toddler food (nuggets/corn dogs), and even kid cuisine's (those tell you not to use a toaster oven) pretty evenly.  My wife has also used it a couple of times to bake small portions of deserts and they turned out great as well. The important thing to remember is punching the right combination of buttons for what you are trying to do.  *I undercooked some waffles and realized that I hadn't pushed 'defrost' after 'toast'. One other trick is the timer, which I had to experiment to get correct.  I kept wanting to hit 'start' after entering the cook time, but that turns off the oven.  After entering your time, you just walk away. I can update my review later if there are any issues, but so far this oven is working very well.
