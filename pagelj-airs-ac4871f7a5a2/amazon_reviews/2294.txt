IMP120D iCarrier SUCCESS
Recently purchased this product for a long trip overseas.  I use both an iphone and ipad and was concerned about the battery life over the 12-20 hours flights, long day trip excursions where traditional power supplies would not be readily available.  This product performed wonderfully.  In general, its a great product, holds several charge outputs to my phones etc, with only one charge of its own battery. It is also very handy in that you can charge 2 devices off it at the same time.  The dual usb outputs was very useful whether charging my 2 devices or sharing one with a friend/colleague. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a battery back up with the most to offer.
