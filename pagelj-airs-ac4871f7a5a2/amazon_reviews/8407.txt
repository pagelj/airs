Not Bad
This movie was a little over the top on the action and killing but for someone who is looking for a decent action flick this would fit that requirement. You could kind of look at this as a newer Die Hard style movie but obviously it lacks compared to that franchise. Overall though it wasn't a bad film and definitely worth a rental/download.
