Nice, it works, had most things included.
All in all the mount was very nice. It feels solid, is pretty simple to assemble, and has some nice features (like a built in bubble level!). However, I had some problems with mine, but it was likely a fluke. Upon installing it and hanging my TV I noticed that it.. wasn't level. The level in the unit said it was, and an external level on the center said it was. But I took it off and discovered the top bar was slightly warped. So it was level on the right side, but had a small slope on the left side. Enough not to see it if you were just glancing at it, but very noticeable if something is hanging on it. I might expect that with wood, but, not metal. Anyway, it took repositioning and tilting the mount a bit to get it correctly. So, you might want to check that kind of thing carefully. Don't assume everything is perfect!
