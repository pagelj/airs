Excellent paring knife
I received this paring knife after sampling and handling Wusthof Classic and a variety of J. A. Henkel knives.  The Mercer has a different gripping (a special polymer rubber) which feels perfect in your hand and gives absolutely nothing up to either the Wusthof or the Henkel.  Most culinary schools and many chefs swear by these. Highly recommended.
