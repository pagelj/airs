I bought this a little over a month ago, and it's worked like a charm since day 1. It has plenty of space for anything/everything that I would ever want to cook in it (including my frozen Jacks Pizzas), and I haven't had a single issue with it, so for $90 I couldn't be happier. I did a fair bit of research before buying this guy, and after doing my due diligence, it seemed like a pretty safe choice in terms of reliability, and when you throw in the fact that it's reasonably sized and still comes in under 100 bucks, I really don't think you're going to do much better in terms of bang for your buck.
