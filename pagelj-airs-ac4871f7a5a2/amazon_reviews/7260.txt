Best $3 I have ever spent
Do not hesitate to purchase this HDMI cable. I was skeptical at first because of the price, but it arrived on time, clicked in to the HDMI slot firmly and does its job just as good as the more expensive cables 10 x this price. Why waste money on a brand name cable that has a fancy description, when they both do the same? Go for it and don't look back. Glad I did!
