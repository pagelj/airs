best computer i have ever owned
Greetings fellow amazonians I picked up this laptop because being on the road with my canival I need to stay connected to all my friends I meet out at home and out here. Mong my trailermate also needs to have access to skype so he can reach his mom when she's available (she is a CIA operative who is normally deeply embedded in some third world country). We had a desktop, but between the space and the fact that it was a little old I felt it necessary to upgrade. The only issues I have with this laptop is that some of my old games are not compatible with it. I have my floppy disk copy of zork which now I can't use and I do not understand why none of my f-key commands do not work on this new laptop. Maybe if amazon would give me a handbook or conversion kit to help out us new users I would appreciate it more. Even with these issues I still give this product 5 stars because the screen is a huge upgrade from the monochromatic green that I had on my desktop. Thanks amazon!
