Power to go
I have not fully tested its capabilities yet concerning how many charges I can get out of it but what has impressed me so far is how well it charges my phone. Even with the screen on and while playing games the battery rapidly charges my phone. I use a longer cable to keep the battery in my pocket and charging while using it so now I never have to worry about running out of juice!
