Canon Lens
I am not happy with this product because one of the contacts on the lens will work for a few minutes then I keep getting ERR 99. I have tried to contact CPHORSE several times with no reply. It seems like this is common with this seller. He doesnt't want to have any returns. I now have to send the lens to Canon Tech Center to get fixed, which i am very unhappy about.
