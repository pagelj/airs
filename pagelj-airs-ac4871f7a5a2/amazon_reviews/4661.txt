I weep
I weep for the paucity of reading comprehension skills in this world. I really do. I also weep because I always swore I would not use the "reviews" section to comment on things that were not the product in question, yet I find myself forced to do just that in this scenario. At any rate, the DIGEST version ("digest: noun. a collection or compendium, usually of literary matter, especially when condensed." Remember Reader's Digest? Chock full of wee versions of books?) costs the same as other "free" things on Amazon--$0.00. Well worth it, even if it weren't free (which it is).
