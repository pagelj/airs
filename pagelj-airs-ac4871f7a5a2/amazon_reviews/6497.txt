Great seller!
Great Seller! Tablet stand carrying case is exactly what this is being used as. Item arrived on time in great condition. However, the USB is a full size and my Nextbook 7 has a mini USB slot. I purchased an adapter but the keyboard did not work. I knew before I purchased that this might happen. It does not matter to me but was worth a try! Target was selling these for twice the price I paid here. I knew up front this might just be a nice carrying case and stand and even thought even if that is all it is used for, it is worth every penny at this price! I can now go from room to room and the Nextbook with a 7" screen is held nicely by clips around the screen. I will put a piece of soft cloth between the screen and keyboard when I shut it to protect the screen. Nice magnetic closure and carrying case. I am happy with this item even though I could not get the keyboard to work with my device. It comes with a stylus pen I cannot use but can give to my husband for use with his cell phone.
