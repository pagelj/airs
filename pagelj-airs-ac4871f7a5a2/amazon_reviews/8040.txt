Good, but heavy
Obviously I should have checked it before, but I did not and when I received the bag I was surprised how heavy it is. I guess that's due to the quality of the materials used, indeed they seem very good and so far it seems a very well finished product, but when when you have to carry the thing a whole day and you start adding all the stuff that you can load it with (and trust me, you can load a great bunch of it) you will feel it in your shoulder.
