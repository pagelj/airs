My Friends Love This BackPack!!!
I am a five year old girl and I got this backpack last month to hold my school stuff.  I like it a lot!  It looks just like the backpack on Dora Explorer and the map is really cool.  It is plastic, so it seems very durable and I love the face and eyebrows which look just like the map character on the PBS show. I sometimes use it to pretend like I am Dora exploring my way home or to other places. I would highly recommend this product.  (dictated by BELLE, Review typed by Mom)
