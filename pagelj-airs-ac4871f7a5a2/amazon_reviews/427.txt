Room 5800+ 12mp pics... WOW...
I plugged this into my 12MP Kodak camera saw it reported room for about 12,000 photos.  (Since I previously had a much smaller SD card, I generally took pictures at less than the 12Mp that camera is capable of).  I bumped it back up to 12Mp and still have room for 5800+ pics ... lol... Wow.  Good thing I've got rechargable batteries - now I never have to hesitate to take a picture. Works well for me!
