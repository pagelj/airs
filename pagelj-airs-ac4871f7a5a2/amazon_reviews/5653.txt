Great Product! Love the App
I bought this camera as a solution to a baby monitor, although it is a bit more expensive than a traditional monitor the FOSCAM IP Control 2 app for only 3.99 on iTunes has allowed me to hook my camera's up to my iPhone and iPad all using the iCloud. This makes it easy to check on my children from wherever I may be. It gives me a piece of mind knowing i can watch them even at work. Great all around product i love where the technology is going.
