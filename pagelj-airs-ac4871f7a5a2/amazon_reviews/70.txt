If you think about dropping $5 for a latte at Starbucks, this is quite a deal. Even though it won't make you superior quality of espresso and latte (Starbucks uses machines that costs $$$), this machine makes pretty good latte. I drink americano by french press so I don't know how the coffee only tastes like but when you 'stamping' right, I see right amount of crema with great aroma. I've tried espresso shot a few times and it was great: but I just use this machine mainly for latte. Very compact and does all the job that you want. Been using it for an year and surprisingly I use this almost every morning: you only need 3 min to make a latte that's less and waiting in a drive-thru line at my local Starbucks. I sometimes utilize this to make hot chocolate (mix Starbucks cocoa powder with hot water and pour steamed milk on the top) or green tea latte (same methodology). I've bought all the equipments (milk frothing container and espresso cup) from Crate & Barrel. Highly recommend for entry-level latte lover. I'm hunting a better machine which can make Starbucks quality latte but I still think this one is great for its value.
