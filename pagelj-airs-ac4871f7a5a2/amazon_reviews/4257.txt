Quality product BUT ....
The product itself is quality - very well stitched and keys feel firm.  My 4 stars is for cheap outer packing:  Be very careful opening the very thin plastic envelope because that is all that stands between so-called protection and the product. Do NOT use a knife or scissors except to get a finger rip hole started in a corner - you can feel the keyboard easily through this thin bag envelope.  Good thing the USPS was lucky and semi-careful or you would get a damaged product through normal mail carriage. Also, be sure your tablet has a full-size USB port for this to plug in, otherwise you will need an adapter to mini.
