We bought this vac two years ago, primarily based upon the Consumer Report review at the time.  We needed a vac at a second location and didn't want to cart our cannister vac back and forth from home. I must start off by saying the noise is deafening.  My wife says I have a hearing issue (OK, I do) but I can surely hear this machine running!  Sounds like a jet taking off . . . no, several jets. I could live with the noise but the real problem is that it really sucks.  No, I mean that in a purely vac sense.  I don't know why other purchasers have said there's no suction with this unit.  Ours will almost lift the wood flooring up!  On carpets, even with the setting at the highest level away from the floor underneath, the unit will pull itself down (on installed carpeting) or pull the carpet up (for throw-rugs) to essentially stop the brushes and create a firm grasp on what's below.  You will need to either shut off the unit or try and lever the head section up to free it from the carpet. As cited by others, the hose is exceptionally short and you will have some difficulty in reaching things you want to vac with the limited attachments included. Well, hope this helps in your decision.  As I said, ours is two years old and we do have the headlight and the bag-fill indicator.  No big deal with either in my opinion.
