I love these cases!
I used the pink one and gave my best friend the blue one! I strongly recommend these cases! My favorite part is the material-- it's great because it is flexible but firm at the same time. I've gotten so many compliments on this case and my friend has also. The only thing that sucks is that the pink one did get a little dirty kindof quickly but I still think this case is well worth its money and it can deffinatly be cleaned to take the dirt look off. so yes i do recommend this case!!
