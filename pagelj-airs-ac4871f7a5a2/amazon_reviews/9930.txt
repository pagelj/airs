An ok book
I thought this book was ok. The plot was just too rushed. The 3 month trial just felt like a 2 weeks trial and they really didn't do anything much. Maybe adding a honeymoon with some laughs would have made the book good. Not the best romance book, but it's good to read if you don't have nothing else to read and just want to pass some time up.
