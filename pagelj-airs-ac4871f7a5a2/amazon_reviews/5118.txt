Timer is worthless for toast and bagels
I had a GE Toaster-Oven for over 32 years (a wedding gift) which served us well until it simply wore out.  I purchased this Black and Decker one and it is truly unreliable unless one stands next to it as it toasts.  Once the setting is made for toast or bagel, then you have to set another infinite rotary switch to begin the toasting process.  The timing is so inconsistent that just a slightly higher setting can burn the toast/bagel.  You have to stand there and watch it as it toasts to take it out quickly.  A lower setting takes forever to toast anything.  I've resorted to a standard toaster with a timer that works and the toast pops up upon completion.  Seems like the old stuff is more reliable.
