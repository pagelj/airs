Good while it lasts.
We have had two of these.  The door has broken on both of them.  The spring-loaded arm becomes out of alignment and the door won't close.  I was able to fix it by bending the arm assembly for a while, but now it is shot.  It also gets extremely hot to touch and the rack/tray does not extend out when the door is opened.  You have to use a mitt or pot holder and the tray is awkward to remove as a result.  It functioned well when it was working, but the door is cheaply attached and prone to failure.  Time to try something else, but the reviews of all the products keep me guessing if any company produces anything of quality anymore!
