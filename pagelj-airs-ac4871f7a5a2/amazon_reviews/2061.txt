Outside? AMAZING. Inside? Not so much...
I was ecstatic to find out that Moshi made a screen protector foe the Kindle Fire! I have friends that use this on their Samsung Galaxy lll phones and say that it was the best investment ever. So when I came across this, I was super excited.-Easy application- it's magnetic!-Easy to clean! Even brings its own shami type wipe-Works wonders outsideThe only downside? When you use it indoors it sort of takes away from the brightness and resolution of the screen. Seeing how I use it more outside this works for me so I can't complain. Great investment!
