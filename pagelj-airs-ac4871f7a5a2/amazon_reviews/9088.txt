Bluray/Video streaming
As Some people may know or not know Sony Blu Ray DVD/streamers use Sony Servers, after having my player for over 1 yr. I find it totally useless for Netflix service, Connection problems, Long buffering, and as far as band width I have a 6m download service. every time I turn around it stops to buffer, while at the same time  I have a LG Streamer playing the same moviewithout so much as a blink. Sony Servers only give me a 0.4 to at best 0.8 meg down load while other 3.3 and 4.1 meg downloads. the DVD works great but the Streamer service is JUNK. don't buy for video streamer if that is what you want it for. I checked with several customer services and they report it has the HIGHEST tech support calls over ALL other brands. when I use it for Crackle or other services that are free it works Ok but still not as good as other brands. therefore my conclusions are it is the SERVER that you must go through to use PAYED services that is the biggest issues. Now this is NOT A SONY bashing report, the rest of my equipment consists of:SONY Speakers, Sony TV, Sony multi CD player,DVD, VHS player, Real to Real tape, Cassette tape player, big screen, I like SONYall the above are all SONY. so stay away from SONY BLU-RAY/VIDEO STREAMERS till they decide to get their ACT TOGETHER.
