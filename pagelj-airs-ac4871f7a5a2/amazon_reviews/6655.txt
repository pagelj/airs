Fantastic backpack.
I bought this for 2-4 day hikes and like comment #1, I can load it up and keep it well under 29 lbs. But unlike other commenters who complained about the hydration bladder compartment, my Platypus 3-liter hydration bladder fits perfectly. No problems. The water (5.5 lbs), dome tent (5 lbs), backpack (4 lbs), sleeping bag (1 lb)and Katadyn water filter (20 oz) combined for about 17 pounds. Everything else was more mass than weight. If I go with a pup tent instead of the dome tent, I can get the weight for a four day hike down to under 25 pounds. If you hike with a group, you might be able to include the dome tent and still keep it under 25 pounds per man. The key is to pack carefully. Figure out in advance what you'll likely need as you hike and keep those things easy to get at. You can hook lots of things (knife, compass, mace, insect spray, etc...) to the straps. Seriously, what do you really need so fast that can't be hooked up or put in the netting or many external pockets? I would not hesitate to recommend this product. Good quality at a great price.
