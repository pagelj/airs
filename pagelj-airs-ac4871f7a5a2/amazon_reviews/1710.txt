Not Bad
I was a bit worried on the quality of this product but i was amazed on the size of sound this small speaker produced! The bass is decent and clarity could be better on the high volume it can sound ugly but with small adjustments with your phone can change that. Im not too picky when it comes to electronics but this is good for its price and size. Love it so far no problems yet but hopefully none in the future!
