I mean it exists...
This isn't as thick as it seems in the picture. It's a cooling fan, alright, but at least for my computer it doesn't work at all. It's also flimsy, annoying (it lights up on the bottom and that looks cool but you have no way to turn that off), and loud. Mine also had hinges loose around one of the fans when it came. Overall probably not even worth $6 but it's better than propping your computer up on CD's, I guess. My computer is cooler just sitting on top of the fan without it being plugged in than when it's plugged in.
