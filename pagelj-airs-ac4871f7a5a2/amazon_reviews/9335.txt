I bought this a couple months ago and it's gorgeous - looks like a piece of nice furniture - I have it on my uncovered patio but every time it rains water gets inside the garbage bag which to me is a big drawback - for the past 5 years I have used regular white kitchen plastic garbage cans with lids in the exact same location on my patio that cost less than half the price of this Suncast and never once did I get rain water inside them. Thought I would doll the patio up with this Suncast Wicker Trash Hideaway but to be honest when it needs to be replaced I will go back to the other kind of trash cans rather than put up with rain water getting inside the garbage bag every time it rains.
