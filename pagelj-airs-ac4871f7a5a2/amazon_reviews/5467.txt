Really good, for what I'm after
I read for enjoyment and entertainment.  I'm happy with Sarah Kings work enough that I've read the first two "Zero" books.  The second one twice. I also read the Outer Bounds books and the Mellenium book.  All were nice ways to pass the time.  I'll probably read them again at some point.  I wish she would make the other books available. I'd like to read the rest of the Zero and Outer Bounds books. I hope she isn't going to pull a Patrick Rothfuss on us (Release the first two books of a trilogy, but not the third.)
