This is our second one as the first stopped working properly after many years of use so we had to get another.  Love that ready made coffee when I wake up in the morning and stumble into the kitchen knowing I will soon be alert and ready for the day with this quality machine realiably  doing it's job with a quality cup of fresh brewed coffee.
