Best Card On The Market
See my review about the SanDisk CF card as the same attributes apply to this card as well.  My camera has both a CF and SD card slot so that I can shoot JPEG's on one and RAW on the other.  Or simply rotate between the cards for safety.  SanDisk cards are so reliable I don't ever think about needing to rotate between the two cards.  Instead, I shoot RAW files on one and JPEG's on the other.  I've used SanDisk memory cards for years and never had any problems - not with failure or performance.  For the money you'll pay, they are simply the best.
