best toaster i have ever used
what can i say nice toaster, a little loud ( beep when it starts and when it pops up ) but still worth every penny. i love it. i took it out of the box, warning before you make toast, plug it in and put the control on four. press the start button and burn of the oil on the internal parts (watch out it stinks). after that good to go. i use it on 4 or 5 and the toast or bagels are nice.
