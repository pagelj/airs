We actually really like this coffee maker and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because we haven't had it long enough to rate its durability.  I like the fact that it turns itself off after a while (not sure how long) so we don't have to worry about coming home to that burned coffee smell and a carafe that's difficult to clean.  The programming feature is easy to use and saves a bit of time in the morning.  We're not terribly particular, so this might not fit the bill for real coffee connoisseurs, but it was a good purchase for us and was reasonably priced.
