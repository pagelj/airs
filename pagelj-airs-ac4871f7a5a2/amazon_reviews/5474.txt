Got better towards the end
Maybe it's just me, but it seemed a little stilted at the beginning, but I guess that was the point considering the social group Beatrice was in.  As I got used to their societal arrangement and they started introducing the other groups, the story got more interesting.  Somewhat reminiscent of The Hunger Games and I think if you liked THG, you'll enjoy this book.  The second book, Allegiant, continues the story, and by then I was really interested in how things would turn out.  Am really looking forward to the third book and have already preordered it.
