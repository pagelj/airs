Another great Canon body
I've been using this body now for several weeks and have been delighted with it from day one.  I upgraded from a 350D (Rebel XT), so obviously there's a lot to be pleased with.  The difficulty of the auto focus system is relative.  A lot of people have complained (on various forums) that it's difficult to use or simply doesn't work.  It is VASTLY different than the AF on other Canon bodies, including the 5D2.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase.  The video is great, the images are beautiful, and ergonomically it's a dream.
