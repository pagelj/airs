PYLE of Cheap Chinese Electronics
Purchased these prior to a long road trip.  Installation was not difficult, instruction were not much help though, the wires are too short for my Honda Ridgeline.  The infrared headphones are CRAP and did not work at all. One unit you could see the infrared leds weren't even turning on.  BUT, our old wired in headphones worked, we had a picture and they made it through the first 1000 mile trip.  By the way there is no external audio on either unit despite having a tiny speaker.  The only reason I know that is because one unit QUIT working completely, so I did a partial disassembly to look for loose connections.  I hooked up the defective monitor to the connection on the one that still works, NOTHING.  It's just a white screen, so I know I still have power, but no picture.  I have contacted, PYLE, who will repair or replace the unit.  Great, but I pay shipping and enclosed $15.00 money order for return shipping.  I find this decidedly uncool since the unit is less than 3 months old!!!  So I'll be out 30 bucks in shipping fees for $65 unit?
