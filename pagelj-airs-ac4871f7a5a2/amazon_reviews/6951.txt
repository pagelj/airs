Well, we've had this for about a month now, and it gets daily use.  So far we love it, EXCEPT I really am not getting a good froth.  Other than that, it's easy to use and makes wonderful coffee.  My husband would agree with another reviewer in that he says it's not strong enough.  This is the most expensive coffee machine that I've ever purchased, and am very happy with it and would recommend it.  Loved the Illy pods it came with and will have to get some more!  It makes a really quick cup of espresso!  NO MESS!! This is nice as I am unable to function in the morning without it!
