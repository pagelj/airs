Overall, I am satisfied with this coffee maker.  For starters, the coffee it makes is delicious.  I have been using a French press for the last 5 years, and was weary about buying an auto-drip brewer, but I was not disappointed.  The first batch of coffee turned out rich and hot.  It is also aesthetically pleasing to look at.  I like the simplistic toggle controls and dials.  However, it is not very ergonomic.  The water bin is right up next to the filter.  It's hard to pour water into the bin without spilling it into the filter.  I have learned to pour it without splashing it, but there should be some sort of separator or conduit that assists in the pouring operation.  Also, the measurement indicators are inside the bin, and are impossible to read, so it's a good idea to measure the water before you pour it in. Instead of a glass carafe and a heating element, I wish it had a stainless steel carafe.  That way, I could just have it turn off right when I am done brewing and then keep the coffee warm for hours.  On this machine, if you want warm coffee, you have to keep the heating element on.
