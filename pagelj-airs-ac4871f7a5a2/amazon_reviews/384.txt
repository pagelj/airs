great product
Based on reviews I bought this using the Amazon discount.  Loved it instantly.  Since I have never used a grill I thought it would require some experience before getting a good result.  My first dinner, a salmon steak, was beautifully seared on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Cleanup was a breeze. Since then I've grilled a variety of chops and fish and the results are consistently excellent. My only minor complaint is that the drip cups do not catch the grease from the top griddle.
