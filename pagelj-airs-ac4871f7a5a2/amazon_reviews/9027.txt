It works great, good suction.  The on/off switch is located on the body instead of the handle.  This makes you reach down to stop, which is not good in tight spaces.  With one hand holding the handle and the other holding the cord, you can suck up the wrong things easily.  The cord does not go up high on the handle, it is high on the body so you have to hold in one hand to keep it out of the way.  You have to assemble the handle to the body when it arrives. No big deal, but you can tell that Hoover is saving a few bucks on assembly and shipping size which results in a inconvenient switch and cord. It is light weight and handles well.  I got a great price on Amazon. com.
