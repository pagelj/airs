Got what I was looking for
I really like this player. As the first BD player I've purchased, I wasn't looking for a lot, except the wireless connectivity for Hulu and Netflix. I've since started using Pandora, too. Everything works great, and there is very little lag time. Some of the other reviews mentioned slow connections and suggested changing the IP settings. Mine was doing very well at first, but I tried changing the settings to see if I could improve the speed, and it actually made it worse. So I changed it back to the default, or local, or whatever (maybe auto-detect?), and it worked better than before. The picture quality is great, and I love that Hulu gives me better definition than Dish network SD does. Only owning a few Blue Rays isn't a big deal if you're not worried about the highest HD, as this plays standard DVDs and upconverts the quality.
