Easy to use, Plug 'n' Play
Easy to use. Perfect standard fitting. My blu-ray-3d-player requires an HDMI plug into the tv, but my blu ray player does not have an audio outlet. I was able to use the Digital Audio Optical line to plug into the Audio outlet on the TV to plug and transfer sound to my surround sound system.
