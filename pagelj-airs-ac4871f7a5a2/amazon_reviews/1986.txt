A little gem!
I have had this little gem for a few days now.  I am so impressed by the image quality you can get out of the Micro four thirds format.  The Olympus E-M5 has so much technology packed into such a small package.  My other camera is a Canon 5D Mark II. While the 5D is clearly the an incredible machine I am finding myself reaching for the E-M5 almost every time I go to take pictures.  The Oly is VERY configurable and you can set it up for a variety of styles of photography.
