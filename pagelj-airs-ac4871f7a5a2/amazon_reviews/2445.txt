Initially, I was skeptical about this vacuum; it is the smallest full size vacuum that I have ever seen. However, from the first test run I was impressed w/ the power this cleaner had behind it. Additionally, I have decided that I prefer the compact size of this cleaner to the monstrous size of most full size vacs. The compact size makes it very maneuverable and allows you to get under/around most tight spots.  This would be a excellent gift for a mother/grandmother because of the compact size and because it is so lightweight. I have owned a Dyson, which I have loved, for the past 10+ years and would have replaced it with the same were it not right before the most expensive holiday of the year, Christmas. I read tons of reviews on many different vacuums and felt that the Shark seemed to have the overall highest customer ratings. I am in agreement w/ the majority on this product; it is a great vacuum, at a low price. The only complaint that I have about this product is that the cord is a little shorter than I would like and the attachment hose is also shorter than it should be( I can not reach the ceiling corners w/ it sitting on the floor). I would, absolutely, recommend this product.
