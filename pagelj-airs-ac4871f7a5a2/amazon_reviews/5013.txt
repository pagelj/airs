Eneloops do the job.
I put two Eneloop AA batteries into my Kodak Easyshare C182 digital camera. I took flash photos one after another, in order to drain the batteries. I counted 250 photos before the low-battery warning automatically shut off the camera. That's a pretty good number of photos from one set of batteries. I'd never have gotten anywhere near that many with alkalines. And you can recharge these Eneloops up to 1500 times, so maybe one set of Eneloop AA batteries will let me take, eventually, more than 350,000 photos. If I take 20 photos each day, then two batteries would let me take photos for about 48 years. Four would suffice for a lifetime. The camera will wear out before the batteries do. I bought 32 of them, just in case there are other things that need AA batteries, also. And I bought 28 AAA size Eneloop batteries, too.
