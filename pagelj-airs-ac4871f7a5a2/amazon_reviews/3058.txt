You cant beat these
Ok this is an honest review of an average person. First off the look. Look is very sporty and has a race car look to the cable. I have two of these cables hooked to a plasna 42 inch. I have them hooked to a ps3 and xbox. The visual is so clear and vivid. I am amazed at the picture but with all yhe good reviews its a no brainer. Can watch 3d movies no problem. The games are better than ever and movies are to real. And kinda scare me. Well if you want cables at a fair price that perform like the best , its fair to say these are your best bet
