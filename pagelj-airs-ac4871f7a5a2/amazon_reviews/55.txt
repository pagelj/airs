Roku is better for Amazon Prime video
For my purposes, this thing is very annoying. I'll prolly hang on to it because i don't have another Blu-ray player, and it does have both co-ax and optical audio outs. The sound and picture are pretty good. But:1. It doesn't remember where you are in an Amazon Prime video so that you can resume playing from that point. So you'd better hope you do because you'll be fast-forwarding from the beginning...2. ... which is all the more infuriating because the fast-forward and rewind both start out way too fast and then accelerate.3. There's no image preview of the stream as you fast-forward and rewind. It's all about reading the time code, and trying to get to a particular spot, which will drive you insane (see point 2). And if you don't know what time code you're looking for (see point 1), you're going to be at it all day.4. It takes an uncomfortably long time to resync an Amazon stream and start playing again. Since you have to wait for this in order to see if you've even gotten to the ballpark of where you were seeking to, discomfort gradually becomes agony.5. If you eject the tray while it's playing an Amazon Prime video, it stops playing the video and goes to the main menu, even tho you haven't inserted a disc yet, or even indicated any intent to play one (maybe you were just ejecting the disc that's in there). You did take note of the time code before you hit the "Open" button, right?6. It forces you to register a BRAVIA account with Sony before it will let you use streaming video.7. Just sitting there, it hums intermittently. If you're looking for a device primarily for Amazon Prime video and you value your sanity, i suggest you look elsewhere. If you don't care about that, it's pretty good for the money. It would perhaps be okay for Amazon if all you ever do is start at the beginning and watch all the way through, maybe with a pause here and there.
