Bad Quality!!!!!!
At first I didn't believe how bad the quality was, so I converted a VHS tape using this software that has already been converted by a professional service. I then compared the 2 dvd's and the difference was night and day. I even tried it with different software. Not only does this not compare to other professional services I have used in the past but the quality is bad and there are even freezes. Not worth it.
