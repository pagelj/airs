This product has no electronics to sequence valves, pumps and vacuums,for filling with water, release of water or rinse cycles,like a regular washing machine. Nor does it have a tub turning, within an outer tub. It is a simplistic product with a single tub and a weak motor which isdirect connected to a 6 inch diameter white disk with grooves on itwhich spins at the base, which tries to turn clothes by direct contact. Heavier clothes prevent this disk from spinning. Absorbent clothes like a single large towel or a small blanket will not spin at all. Clothes need to be washed in small groups requiring more hands on to put clothesin and out. There is no rinse cycle; instead there is a fragile-looking white pipe stemmingfrom the base which can be manually positioned on the ground to drain water slowlyor which can be hooked manually to a clip on top to keep water inside. Slow drain of water (through gravity) leaves much dirt on the clothes. There is one of those mechanical timers which makes a click-click-clicksound which directly applies power to the disk spin motor for a maximumof around 10-15 minutes. This product fails to do any rinsing, which is the toughest part ofwashing clothes and does not turn medium weights of clothes. Until this product has a stronger motor designed in, it is a ripoff. When turning (or failing to turn) this product consumes between 170 and 190 Wattswith a regular 3-prong US AC power connection. Unfortunately, there are not many choices in this small washer arena.
