Great Product!!
Here's just a short little review for the Roku 3:The packaging is very easy to open and the Roku is the first thing you when when you open the Roku Box. Included are the Roku, Remote, 2 AA Batteries, Power Brick, and Purple Earbuds for use with the remote. The Roku itself is very small and lightweight and does not take up much space; however, if you are still worried about the size, you can buy the additional TV Mount to hang the Roku on the back of your TV. The Remote is very light as well even with the batteries in, and does not feel very durable, even though it is very strong. The Roku is always on and cannot be turned off unless unplugged, though, Roku says that it takes up very little energy. There are many different channels to chose from, some of which may not be displayed on the Roku website. I would recommend that you go through the website and install any channels you want from there, then start searching for Roku Channel Codes to download private channels that are not displayed (such as CNN, BBC World, etc...). One of the only downsides is that Roku does not support YouTube; however, there is a channel called VideoBuzz, which has access to all YouTube videos. Overall, I am very pleased with the Roku 3, and would recommend this for anyone looking for a streaming device for your TV/Monitor.
