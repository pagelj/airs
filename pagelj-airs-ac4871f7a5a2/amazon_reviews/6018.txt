Compact and Trendy!
This is a sleek, well-finished bag. I love the Cabernet & Jet combination.. Compact & Lightweight yet spacious enough to accommodate the essentials ( Laptop, charger, a few pens, maybe one or two magazines. ) I love the soft (velvet??) sleeve for the laptop. There is a separate pouch for your charger.. I got this bag for use with my 13" Macbook. Would definitely recommend it!
