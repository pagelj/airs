For years I've been using a cheap knife set.  I got sick of taking forever to cut vegetables (and of always having my knife slip rather than cut), so I decided to get a more expensive set of knives.  I've been skeptical for years of getting expensive knives because I'm not really a fan of washing dishes/utensils by hand. Anyway, when they arrived my first test of them was to cut up an onion.  The difference was night and day.  Usually -- I diced the onion in probably no more than 15-30 seconds, tops (after peeling it).  The cuts were so smooth and proper that I didn't even cry while I was cutting it.  And as for washing these knives -- if you're prompt about cleaning the knife right after usage, it takes only a little bit longer to do it by hand than it would take to put a cheap knife in the dishwasher.  And the built-in sharpener is convenient and easy to use.
