I'm in love!!!!
I owned a blackberry before I switched to the galaxy 3 and I'm never going back.  This is the best smartphone out there. The thing that caught my attention first was the large screen, this phone feels great in your hands and is easy to use. The only complaint I have is the battery life  but that could be my fault cause I cant put it down ;)This phone is a great buy!
