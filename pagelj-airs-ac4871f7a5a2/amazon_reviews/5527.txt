Handbag Review
I was very excited to receive this product. I was a real good price, and the purse was really cute. The moment I received the purse I noticed that the material was not the best, but it was still cute. I decided to take my new handbag out for the night. That same night the purse's straps broke off. I was very unhappy with the fact that the purse only lasted me one day. I did not put that much in the purse, so, I doubt it was due to too much stuff inside.
