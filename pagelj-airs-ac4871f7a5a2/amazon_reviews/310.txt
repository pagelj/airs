This vacuum does not have a strong suction.  It lumbered along barely getting up crumbs from our shag rug for 6 months then finally stopped working.  The suction got worse and worse, until it wasn't worth using it anymore.  I wish that I had spent a little more money and got a vacuum cleaner that worked and lasted.
