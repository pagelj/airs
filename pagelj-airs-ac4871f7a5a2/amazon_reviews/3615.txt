Very upset with this product.  When we received it, it wouldn't run, the start button would work for the timer and make the beep sound like it was working but the microwave wouldn't run.  About a day later it started working, we thought maybe it was just shock from the shipping.  It worked for about 2 weeks and then started to do the same thing again.  I contacted panasonic and they gave me two service centers I could have fix it under warranty- both service centers were 2 hours away in opposite directions- how convenient!  They told me I could ship the product to the service center and pay for the shipping, by that time I could pry buy a new microwave.  I problem solved myself that the reason it wasn't working was because when the door was shut it must not be able to reach the sensor inside to let the microwave know to run.  When I hold the door shut with some force then it runs.  I contacted Panasonic again to let them know this.  Its been over a week and they havn't even bothered to follow up with my concern.  So No I would not recommend this product
