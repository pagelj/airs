Very nice small "fixed blade tactical knife"
First of all, I was very impressed with the shipping of this product. I got it 2 days after placing my order. I was then impressed with the packaging, it was not over done but just right IMHO. The box the knife came in was what I would expect it to be in, it was a standard product presentation. The knife is pretty much exactly what I thought it would be. It's sharp (could be a bit more but I'll take care of that)won't shave you but will do basic stuff and could be used for defensive situation if needed. I'll have this inside (velcroed)of zipped pocked of a gun case I carry one of my weapons in at times. So it's out of way but can be accessed easily if needed. I'm pleased with it and for the money it's a good deal.
