Great camera - but doesn't fit in *my* pocket...
"Pocket" camera? You have to have very big pockets... I've been using a Sony DSC-TX66 for the past 6 months as my daily camera and generally love it, but when I saw the enthusiastic NY Times review for this DSC-RX100, I got very excited and ordered one. The RX100 is a great camera. It is fast and takes great pictures and has every manual setting that a serious photographer could want. But compared to my DSC-TX66, it is huge. My TX66 comfortably fits into my front pants pocket with my wallet. The RX100 does not comfortably fit into any pocket I have, even by itself. This is a big drawback for me. If the photos from the RX100 really were *amazingly* better then any other smallish camera, I might find a way to live with the extra size but I shot both cameras side by side for several days and I really don't think there was a clear winner on image quality. I know that the RX100 has an amazingly huge sensor, but in real life it does not seem to make a noticeable difference in final image quality- at least not for the photos I take. I even took a lot of low light and fast motions shots, but the fact is that the smaller TX66 is also a great low-light performer. One plus is that this RX100 does finally have a standard micro USB port which is nice. The TX66 (like every other Sony I've ever had) uses a proprietary cable, which is just one more cable to have/lug around. Overall, I am sticking to my TX66. If you are looking for lots of manual settings and focus, and don't mind carrying your camera around your neck or in a bag, then maybe the RX100 is for you. If you just want to take great pictures, and want to always have your camera in your pocket then I'd recommend you look at the older and smaller TX66 instead.
