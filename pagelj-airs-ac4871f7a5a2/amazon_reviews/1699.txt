Takes Great Pictures
I use this camera every day all day taking lots of photos. It takes great shots even in low light situations. I am on my second one, it does not like to be dropped on a hard surface floor. Not many cameras do. The only draw back to this camera is that the LCD is not very bright and it is impossible to see it outside in bright sunlight.
