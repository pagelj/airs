Great knife
Feels really solid in your hands. I have a Rada 8" chef's knife and I use that about equally as much as I use this one, for different kinds of jobs. This one feels a little more substantial and solid than the Rada, though it's not quite as sharp. It's a great knife though, I use it a lot.
