Highly entertaining!
This was a great story. I was quickly drawn in to the story and had trouble putting this down. The characters were wonderful and real, I could easily attach people that I know in real life to each of the characters here. I enjoyed this style of writing allot. I'm looking forward to the next installment of this story!!
