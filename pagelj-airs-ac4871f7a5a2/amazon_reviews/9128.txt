I like to share my experience after I have had a chance to use the product for a while and I must say, after only having this vacuum for a month, it is a wonderful product.  I purchased the vacuum based on other reviews of folks that had the product for a while, and I must say I agree, it does the job the description says it does.  I have a siberian husky that has lots of hair, and it picks the hair up and leaves my carpet looking like it has just been cleaned by a professional.  I am very happy with this and would highly recommend it to anyone who has pets with lots of hair.
