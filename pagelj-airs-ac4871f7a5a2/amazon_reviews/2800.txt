Charge Sync Cable
To whom it may concern:  I will not order from this company again.  I received the wrong size, it was supposed to be a 6' cable but was a shorter one and to boot, it didn't work.  I ordered it to charge and sync my iPod and iPhone.  That's all I have to say about it.  Actually 1 star is even too many. Regards,Susan from Clarkston, Michigan
