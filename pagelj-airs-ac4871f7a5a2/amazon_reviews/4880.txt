Wonderfrul Camera
I purchased this today at Best Buy for more than it is listed on Amazon.  However, I need it for a trip and didn't want to worry that it would not arrive in time.  From the moment I used the camera in the store I could tell it was amazing quality.  The zoom is incredible.  I was able to take a photo of a sign all the way across the store and it looked as if I was standing a few feet away.  The fact you can up load pictures online or back them up is a great feature that a lot of the cameras I looked at didn't include in the same price range.  Overall, I'm pretty pleased with my purchase.
