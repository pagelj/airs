Wow. Best Sci-Fi Debut since Old Mans War.
I have been a science fiction fan since the late fifties. The problem nowadays is that everything is just the same old thing. That is why when I run across something that is new and well written, I have to comment on it.  The Martian by Andy Weir is just such a book. It is an extreme "Survivorman" story set on Mars. It is as if the writers of "The Big Bang Theory" wrote "Robinson Crusoe". It is heavy on the nerdy science part of science fiction but despite that it is impossible to put down.  Mark Watley, botanist and general handyman on a mission to Mars, is, through no fault of his own, stranded alone on Mars. He must figure out how to survive for more than 500 days until his first possible hope of rescue. He does some things that are incredibly brilliant and some that are just plain stupid.  The majority of the book is his log entries which are funny, sarcastic, fatalistic and, since he is basically talking to himself, have a ring of truth to them.  I remember feeling the same way about "Old Man's War" when it came out. I hope Andy Weir writes more books as I will be first in line.  Get this book, read this book. You won't be sorry.
