Overall pleased
Bought these for my new apartment because I needed decent cooking knives on a budget. They all have proper weight and rigidity. The construction exceeds my expectations. Not being a chef, I don't know how versatile this collection is, but I easily cook for 4 with these a few nights a week. I did not know how to use an edge honer, and the included instructions were not very helpful. However, YouTube was very helpful. Pros-- Price- ConstructionCons-- Not very sharp shipped, but the edge honer/sharpener is a good one!- The storage block seems cramped.
