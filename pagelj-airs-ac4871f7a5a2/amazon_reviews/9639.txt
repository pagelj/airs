I ordered this microwave this week, after my last $100 GE microwave exploded after 15 months. It's a lovely bright white. The buttons are useful - it has lots of settings but you can also make it go by just pressing start, which sets it for 30 seconds. I mainly use it as a popcorn maker and for warming left overs. Relatively happy - it's slightly noisier than my old GE one, but I'm confident it will last at least a year. I don't believe that any machine <$250 can be expected to last much longer than that. For its price, this is a 4* microwave. Ps. It really did arrive next day with amazon prime - I had a very short lived popcorn crisis once I'd decided on the right machine!
