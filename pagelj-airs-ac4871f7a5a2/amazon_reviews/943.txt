Testing 1,2,3. Check. Check. Is this on?
Recording devices have been part of my life since I was a kid. Tiny reel to reel recorders, cassette, big reel to reel machines, VHS format,DAT, ADAT, hard disk systems, the list is still growing. Now what we've got here is damn near a studio in your pocket. Up to 24bit resolution, phantom power to run better mics than the on board ones. Or you can go 'line in' from a board, or plug in an instrument. Did I mention it fits in your pocket? This rascal is very useful and can't be easier to use. I've been recording live shows with it for the last month. Satisfaction meter is at full deflection. It comes with CuBase which provides hours of fun and frustration. Dislikes are, the 90 to 120 degree pickup pattern on the mics is useless. Why they even tried to do it this way is beyond me. The mic stand adaptor should be a shock mount type, not a stand in for a microphone body that slips into a mic clip. Better storage case would be nice as well. Overall good, useful, feature laden tool at a reasonable price musicians should not be without.
