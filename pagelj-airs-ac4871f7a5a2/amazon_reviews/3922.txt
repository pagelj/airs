OUTSTANDING!
Researched this product to an extreme before spending the money, and am truly pleased with the product... I'm not a huge cook, but have been doing more cooking since I got the Breville... Top pros for me are the auto-eject tray (my dealbreaker as the oven is just a tad large for my small kitchen, but the smaller model didn't have this feature) and - kind of a surprise - I am actually using the top of the oven as a plate warmer while I do other things in the kitchen - nice treat! I saw a couple of comments about the toaster signal not being loud enough... I would disagree strongly... pleasant enough sound, catches your attention, and I really don't like loud noises in the morning!
