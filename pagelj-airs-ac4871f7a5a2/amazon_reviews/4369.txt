perfect case for galaxy tab 10.1
I added the rugged gumdrop case to my tablet and it still fits quite nicely in the carry case.  Plenty of room for a power cable, pens, business cards as well as a neoprene slot for usb thumb drives.  I also have a bluetooth android keyboard which is nice but, unfortunately it is just a little too long to fit in the case.  Overall, nice carry case for a tablet or netbook.
