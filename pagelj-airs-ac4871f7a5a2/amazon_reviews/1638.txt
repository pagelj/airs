Issues
When even the cover is at odds with the story you know it will have a lot of issues. A few minutes in Photoshop could have turned that blonde hair dark to match the heroine in the story. There's also the issue of grammatical errors, of which there were enough to send a grammar Nazi like myself into seizures. The sex was written well enough, if a bit repetitive. I suspect this writer is capable of so much more, but the glaring lack of an editor takes away from what could have been a much better story. I shouldn't complain really. I picked this up on a free promotion, and I got what I paid for.
