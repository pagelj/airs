GODS will
I will tell you that it was God that brought me to read this book.  We were having a Relay for Life Yard Sale.  The book was only one of a hundred sitting in a box.  I thought the title strange and laughed as I placed it in the box.  After the sale something urged me to see if the book had sold.  I redeemed the book from the box of unwanted books and decided to take it home and read it.  I couldnt put it down.  I gave up trying not to cry as I realized how many other Gods I had been putting in front of Jesus Christ. I see Gomer and Hosea in a totally different light.  I no longer question why God can take someone so unclean and make them whiter than snow.  I will pass this book on.  I believe God speaks to us just like the book says.  Although I hadnt been listening lately.  Thank you GOD for not giving up on me.
