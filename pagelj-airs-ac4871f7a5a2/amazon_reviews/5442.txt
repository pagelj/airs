the best phone ever!
i've never reviewed anything on amazon but I LOVEEEE this phone so i just have too! i've had this phone about two months now. I rant and rave about it to everyone i meet. I asked a random guy once to take a picture of me and my friends,and his friend came to check out what he was doing,after he saw the quality of the picture the friend was like what kind of phone is that?!?! they were both impressed..... the picture quality is AWESOME!!!! then they saw it was an HTC. the touch screen is responsive and doesnt really stick,ive had touchscreens before and because they are so sensitive and once they stop working the phone is useless until you replace the screen, i vowed never to buy one again... but boyyyy am i happy i broke that vow!!!! soo, do it... buy this phone :-Dp. s:i live in the caribbean and i get correct weather info from the phone for my relatively unknown, little country which i think is cool too. lol
