Just started using it, but sofar so good
I bought this as a gift for my father.  So far we love it, there are only two downsides so far.#1 you must set up an account with it online, and link a credit or debit card to it.  This seems unnecessary when we only planned to use free channels, and subscriptions that we paid for separately such as netflix.  My dad was VERY uncomfortable giving out his card information over the internet.  It took some talking to the tech support on the ROKU website to set up an account without linking a card to it.  And that was only after he listed all the reasons I should link a card for "convenience", and I finally lied and said we did not have a card to link it to.#2 Youtube. I read articles about being able to attach Youtube to it recently, but as it turns out it was recently removed at the request of Google.  This isn't a huge deal, but I only found out about Youtube no longer being on there when I was setting it up for my dad. Otherwise it seems to work great.  It has many channels from news, sports, entertainment, etc...  Some require subscriptions, but is a nice alternative to cable. Also it allows you to use Netflix on TVs that do not have a fancy DVD player or game council attached to it.
