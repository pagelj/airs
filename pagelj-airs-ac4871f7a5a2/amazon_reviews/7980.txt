I purchased these for my Mother.  She was so excited to get new silverware.  As a college student, I was shopping on a bit of a budget, and with this particular product, I did not have to sacrifice quality to get a good deal.  These are strong and sturdy while feeling delicate and refined to the touch.  They wash well by hand or in the dishwasher and there has been no signs of rust whatsoever.  All in all: A great purchase!
