Future of TV!
I've been thinking of dropping my monthly cable subscription for years now (I won't name the provider). This product right here along with Apple TV is the future of Home Television. I've decided to purchased Roku because my friend has it and recommended it to me. I got this setup on my bedroom and hopefully this year, I'll be able to have this on our entire home.
