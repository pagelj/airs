Collector's Edition Fills in the Gaps
Revisiting AvatarThere were several important points and fascination with the three DVD edition of Avatar.  The director, James Cameron is interviewed and tells of his inspiration for the film, including the Amazon jungle, the dams that are being built there, the corporate encroachment across the Amazon Basin.  It's a full documentary and is quite an eye-opener. We're taken on a guided tour of the rainforest and meet the native peoples who are being slowly displaced by this encroachment.  The Amazon natives are represented in the movie as well.  "Dances with Wolves?"  Don't think so. Pandora is the metaphor for the Amazon rainforest.  Watch the movie and the beginning scenes we have strip-mining and (what some reviewers totally miss) has little to do with Marines.  These Marines were now mercenaries working for the company that is strip mining for minerals for Earth. I really enjoyed this film - it speaks well of the battle between corporate greed and the displacement of the environment and the people who depend upon it.  But it also is about a man who has a disability and is being called on to take over for what his brother was going to do, to transform himself. Cameron's film also shows this transformation and dependence on nature and the environment. The complete collector's edition has so much material.  I really liked the extended scenes.  The beginning with what Earth looks like at this time, our friend fighting in a bar with his wheelchair was great, and the big, bad corporation and what its goals and purposes are. Regardless of how you feel about the theatrical edition, do watch the collector's edition.  Much more to it, fills out the story and it's nothing to do with "Dances."  I mean really now!
