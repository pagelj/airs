First one worked 15 minutes, Second one wonky, much better after 4/24 software update
I decided to spin the roulette wheel on this camera - it seems the odds of getting a working one is about 50/50 - and got a dud. As soon as I received it, I updated the software as implored. After getting about 15 minutes of footage, the camera started showing a temperature warning and shut off... every single time, a few seconds after turning it on, regardless of temperature, whether or not it was plugged into the computer, WiFi on or off, and regardless of the battery I was using (I bought some Wasabis as well). The card used was a Transcend Class 10 32 GB. Too bad there isn't a separate star system for Amazon's service, which I'd give 5 stars. I just said I wanted the item replaced, and they immediately shipped out the replacement. Of course I need to send back the dud within 30 days. If you're going to take a chance on the GoPro 3 Black, get it from Amazon. UPDATE 6/5: The replacement camera worked for the most part, but would freeze in time lapse mode - both straight time lapse and while filming. I installed the 4/24 update, which seemed to fix this issue. Glad it seems I finally have a fully functional camera.
