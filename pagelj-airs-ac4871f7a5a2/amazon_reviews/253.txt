digital the only way to go
I am still just in the learning phase of it all. I find it easy to use and has great color and sharpness. I was really goood with the film 35 mm SLR and I hope to get as good with this camera. I feel like I got more for my money in the digital land than I did when I bought my Pentax film slr and lense for it. You are able to delete photos that you don't like and print only the ones that are your favorites I researched a lot and weighed in this camera with a pentax and a canon I found this to be the best buy and more the middle of the road camera. I am very happy with it. I think anyone who wants a digital that they can experience more than just point and shoot will love this camera. If you don't plan on ever using the different aperatures f stops etc then I would stay with a nice point and shoot camera they will take as good of pictures as this does in its guide mode auto settings. If you want to get more in depth photos then go with this camera. I got my best deal through amazon when purchasing this camera.
