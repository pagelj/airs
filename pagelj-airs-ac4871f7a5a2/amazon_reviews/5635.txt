Excellence in Science Fiction
This is the only Amazon "Special Offers" Kindle Title I have ever purchased, and hopefully it doesn't ruin the prospects of any to come. I had no expectations or knowledge of this book prior to downloading but was hooked instantly. The characters are great but not too overly detailed. The environment and description is well written and makes your mind wonder through the space. There are twists and turns just as often as the main staircase so often traveled in the books. The science and thoughts are sound and remind me of Crichton with their possibility. Bottom line - this is an amazing set of stories which will hold your attention like a vise and leave you satisfied when it finally lets go. If you have hesitations, I encourage you to try a sample of the first book - you will certainly make the decision to purchase before you are through. I am now going to explore the rest of the reads Mr. Howey has with eager anticipation.
