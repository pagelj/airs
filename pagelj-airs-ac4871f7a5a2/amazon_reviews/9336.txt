Affordable Smart Phone or Pocket Organizer
I wanted a PDA as an organizer and discovered they no longer make them - it's all smartphones now. This little phone is not only affordable, it's cute, easy to use, and with Page Plus phone service you can have a PDA w/backup phone service for only $10 every 4 months. I find I use it the most when I want to check something quick on the internet while I'm laying in bed --I can turn it on, connect to Wi-fi, look up my info and be done in the time my computer would take just to fire up -- very handy. With a few useful apps loaded - it's my go-to device and I have no contract and therefore don't have to pay through the nose for the privilege of using a smartphone.
