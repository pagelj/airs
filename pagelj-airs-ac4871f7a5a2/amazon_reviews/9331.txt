wrong description - NOT 18/10.....18/0
The description states that these are 18/10.  They are not.  They are 18/0.  That makes a huge difference.  It is a pretty design.  About 6 years ago I purchased this product from a well known store chain.  They are still in great condition and I've never had a problem with them.  I also love the design.  They are 18/10 and have a nice weight to them.  They are stamped nicely with the name.  When I found these on Amazon, I was so happy.  I ordered them right away.  When I received the box, I was confused.  There were visible differences.  The tongs on the forks were different.  All of them were much thinner than the older ones.  The Oneida "stamp" looked uneven and cheap.  On the old ones you can not feel a difference where the design is, with these, there are tiny bumps on all the parts that are darker.  Obviously, in the past 6 years, Oneida has changed where they make this set.  The box said these were made in China.  They are just very cheap looking and I'm not going to even risk keeping them just because they have the same handle design of the other ones.  I would hate to have a nice heavy knife in one hand and a weightless fork in the other.  Returning tomorrow.
