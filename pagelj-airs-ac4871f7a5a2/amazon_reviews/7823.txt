WELL MADE  AND GOOD LOOKING
The SLRC201 bag by Case Logic is truely a fine camera bag.  I had purchased several other Case Logic bags for my cameras but this one is, I believe, the best of the bunch.  It is large enough to hold my Pentax K5 camera, with a 70-300 zoom attached, with the lens hood attached.  There are side and front pockets that can hold SD cards, extra batteries or even the battery charger too.  The side pockets will also hold a small compact camera as well. It is a well constructed bag made of a black nylon type material.  There are four zippers that slide well and don't catch.  The interior is a yellow orange material.  The bag is well padded and has a handle on top.  The bottom is a black ruberized material that seems to be waterproof, although I haven't tested it for that.  The strap is designed to go over your shoulder and not around your waist.  The bag is big, but not ungainly and will fit nicely in an armpit. Overall, I love this bag.  It's sturdy and durable and will protect your DSLR from most kinds of damage.  I used to buy the more expensive bags from Tamrac, but this bag easily compares to them.  It is a very handsome  bag and unless you have additional lenses and gear, it's the way to go.  Bag is made in Vietnam. Pros:1. Nice size, holds a DSLR W/ attached zoom lens and hood.2.
