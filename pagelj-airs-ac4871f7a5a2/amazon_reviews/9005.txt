Godd app with one problem.....
It did not sync my whole contact list on my Kindle Fire. I have about 20 contacts and it only synced about 5 of them. Since there is no way to add new contacts through the app itself, this is very annoying. Other than that issue, so far everything else works fine. It is very cool and convenient to be able to text people while using my Kindle Fire. The notifications, for new texts received, is working fine for me. If the contact list issue gets fixed I will definitely be giving it 5 stars.
