the story continues
I still like the story and this is just the second part of the where a bouts of the characters started in the previous book, I did not feel comfortable with the way the author split the story of the characters, bu I hope in the books to come that will be fix. if you are planing to read this saga to the 7th book as it is promised by the autor or if you really like the type of literature, then you should read it and will enjoy it having in mind that the story will be resolved in the near future ( I Hope). as a side note for those whose native language is not English, the vocabulary some time can be a little hard to get, but is not big dio, it is easy to follow after you clear the meaning of the slung used. regardsAlvaro Diaz Codoceo.
