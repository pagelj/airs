worked for one trip
Bought this for a trip to Mexico. Was very pleased with the pictures, both in and out of the water.  A few months later we took another trip. The pictures were terrible. They were blurry and when using the zoom the view finder would go dark. Was lucky I checked the pictures at the end of the day and had another camera. Since it was still under warranty I sent it in for repair. Was told they could not repair it and since Kodak was not making cameras anymore they sent me this lousy video camera. Gave it away.
