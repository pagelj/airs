Loved the ideas; execution not-so-much
Being only the 2nd Sci-fi book that I've read, I don't have a lot to compare to in the genre. To some degree I enjoyed reading this book, mainly due to the ideas put forth on the future of space flight and it's relativistic effects on time and perceived existence. The ideas he had about coming home to an unrecognizable world was a central theme of the book, and I'm sure something that the Author related to, having served in Vietnam. I did appreciate the amount of creativity that went into his view of space warfare and the future of economics/human welfare. Unfortunately, there were a few issues which I couldn't ignore that tarnished the story somewhat for me. Due to the amount of time (and space) that the book covers, I felt that the story was disjointed, and never 'grounded' to any one time or place. As a result, the forever-changing characters seemed flat for me, and I had trouble identifying and caring for any of them, other than the main character. As well, there was a point in the story where some of the economics of the future were explained, a different way of purchasing goods and services described. The author went on about this for a while, stuck with it, and then near the end of the book, went back to the old ways of describing this process, without explanation to the change. As some other reviewers suggested, this version of the book may have been changed from the original, edited version. While The Forever War had some very interesting ideas, the plot felt somewhat hollow and characters unremarkable, which hurt the overall experience in my opinion.
