Just a high quality product
I love this bag. I use it to store my tools (and my laptop) and it does its job exceptionally well. Its strong, compact, comfortable and stylish. Being a computer tech, it allows me to have my tools on-hand to complete a job (I visit various companies and departments). There are many compartments to store a multitude of tools and accessories. Being in the field, you need to have your tools with you as you move from PC to PC, Department to Department, User to User. Its much easier (and cooler) to have a backpack with your things, rather than having to lug a hand-bag around. I'd recommend this bag for the young up-and-coming computer tech as well as the casual laptop user. Enjoy
