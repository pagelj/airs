Nice Coffeemaker. Makes great coffee that stays hot!  I am purchasing a second one today.  My first one lasted 3 years. I'm hoping this next one will last a bit longer. The first few months I was very frustrated with this coffee maker because some mornings I would find the coffee all over the counter and the floor!  I was just about to throw it away when I figured out the problem was not the coffeemaker BUT the problem was with the FILTER! I had been using economy filters. Don't buy the cheaper coffee filters. I began using Melitta #4 coffee filters and I never experienced the overflowing of coffee all over the counter again. My problem was solved.
