Great Camera / Helpful Technical Service!
Purchased three Foscam cameras the other day. The setup is a bit tricky given some of the more advanced wireless routers may require tweaking in settings. Called Foscam Technical Support and spoke to Sandra, who was very helpful in going through setup to get all of the cams up and running. Would definitely recommend this product!
