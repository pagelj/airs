Square Trade Lives up to their warranty
I purchased a 3 year warranty + ADH for my husband's new laptop last year. He was working at his desk a couple weeks ago and accidentally bumped his coffee over. He panicked as it landed right in his keyboard. I arrived home to find a devastated hubby who was desperately trying to drain the coffee out of his beloved computer. I reminded him that I bought the warranty, but he was skeptical because we've had problems with other companies. Square Trade was awesome! They sent email updates and a shipping label. We packed the laptop and sent it off. I was really hoping that Square Trade would come through so we could replace his laptop. (And so I wouldn't hear "I told you so"). Square Trade sent an email when the laptop was received, another when they confirmed that it was damaged as I claimed, and still another when they were sending the money to his pay-pal account. I just bought a 3yr ADH warranty for his replacement laptop. This was the best warranty transaction I've ever done.
