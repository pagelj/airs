Beware of D90 sporadic 'F--' Error
Great Camera.. But i get sporadic 'F--' Error in the middle of photo shoot and i will have to remove the lens and remount it to fix the problem. Unfortunately my 30 day Amazon return window elapsed and i am stuck with a faulty $1,300 so called Great D90 camera. Nikon said it would fix it since i am covered under the warranty after that it will come out my pocket.  I am the second person reporting the same 'F--' Error problem in Amazon. com. I have given one star because i have to give atleast one to Post this review.
