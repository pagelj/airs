Adequate Cable; Great Value
I think the title says it all. Notably, mine measured a little short at 5 feet 8 inches. A purist would call that consumer fraud, but I am willing to chalk it up to quality control. Regardless, this gets an HDMI signal from point A to point B; no frills in quality or packaging. Just make sure that point A and point B are slightly less than 6 feet a part. Please do not expect more for this phenomenal price. Overall, this was a worthwhile purchase, and I would do it again if I needed a spare.
