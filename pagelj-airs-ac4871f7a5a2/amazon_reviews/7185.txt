Good Player until it breaks!
I bought this particular player because of its high rating by Consumer Reports.  It worked great for about 3 months and then the DVD tray began hesitating to load and unload, and then a whirring noise would start like the DVD was trying to seat itself.  It would not play my last DVD. I called LG; their customer service reps are all foreigners with a minimal understanding of English (he said he was in Alabama - which I think is now just south of Bangladesh).  The warranty on this product is 1 year parts but only 90 days labor.  So, I am out of the labor warranty.  To get it fixed, I need to  prepay $70 (without their ever looking at it).  That is 1/2 the amount I paid for the unit and I am not giving them more money. So I wrote this review and sent a copy of it to LG Customer Service.  They agreed to fix it at no charge and sent me a prepaid FedEx Label.  In less than 2 weeks my repaired unit was returned repaired.  If it works well over the next 6 months, I will change this review to 4 stars because I really did like it when it worked.
