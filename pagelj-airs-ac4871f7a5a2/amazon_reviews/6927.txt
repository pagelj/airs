the only plot to this story was to make the reader aware of a charity called the Zoe Institute for single parents.  no romance, no drama, no plot.  the characters were so unselfish and dedicated, which is nice but it was just overdone.  As the reader, you felt very inadequate as a person.  So this was just a hard sell for the charity as far as I'm concerned.
