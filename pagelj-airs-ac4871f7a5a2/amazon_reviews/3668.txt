This is a very nice phone!
GREAT!!! There is so much do on this phone. Even a radio! I never had that on a phone before. My last phone was a optimus elite slider. Now I won't go back. Battery life is number 1! Way more better than the elite. I had it on all day, doing texting, camera, radio, and even the gps. GPS wins me over. Finds signal right away, not like my other gps, that I'm tossing out. I voice my destination in and I found that very helpful. I just started checking it out, so I'm sure I'll find alot more things I'll like about this phone.
