Read this book!
Executive summary: Great story, great characters. The writing is brilliant. I read the one-star reviews, and I think those readers don't understand the book. It's really well done. I'm looking forward to the sequel(s) (there's one coming out in January, but this could easily be a series). One of the best things is the writing. You know how writing teachers always say "Show, don't tell"? Well, Riggs does that. Watch this:"I clutched the rail and stared into the green waves, contemplating the fish who might soon be enjoying my breakfast."He doesn't say "it looked like this" or "I felt like that," and yet you have a complete picture of what's going on -- and I didn't even need to set up the scene for you. The book is billed as "young adult," but if you're out of your teens, don't let that stop you. If you read the Harry Potter books and wondered what to read next, here it is.
