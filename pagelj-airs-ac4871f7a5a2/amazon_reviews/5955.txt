Great bag
A great bag with plenty of room for EOS plus three lenses and extra gear (battery chargers, filters, cables, etc.).  The dividers are movable, but they come in what I think is probably the most usable configuration for the majority of people.  It would be nice to be able to get additional dividers to do something a little different, but no complaints!
