hard to get use to
I purchased this to replace my 8-year old digital camera.  This might be a great camera but I'm still learning.  Over 600 pictures taken in the first two months and I'm still trying to get a clear picture.  I've tried every setting numerious times.  With so many settings, I have lost a lot of great moments because of blur or odd coloring. The program for loading your pictures on to computer is really slow and far too complicated.  My old Kodak digital downloads were far easier. I purchased this because of the better sounding reviews.  I wish I had gone with another brand.
