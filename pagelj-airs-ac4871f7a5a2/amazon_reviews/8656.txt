Great Book!
The Mark of Athena is EPiC. There is the perfect amount of adventure, and mystery. I loved how Rick put each chapter in another person't perspective! Anyway, another thing I LOVED was the romance. There were some conflicts, which kept me on the edge of the seat to see who ends up with who. The thing I don't like about this book is the end- another cliffhanger. I don't like cliffhangers cause I never know what happens after! I can't wait another year for the next book to come out...
