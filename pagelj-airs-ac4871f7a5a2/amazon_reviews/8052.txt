Great camera - virtually impossible for the non-techie  to install wirelessly
The camera works great and is priced right BUT... unless you have a PhD in Computer Science, you will find this device challenging to install without the use of the Ethernet cable.  I'm more computer literate than most and it took me more than an hour to get it to work using WiFi.  Even after I got it to work, I'm not sure how I did it.  The directions are useless and most of the advice you'll find on the Internet is as well.  Once you do get it working, you'll love it!
