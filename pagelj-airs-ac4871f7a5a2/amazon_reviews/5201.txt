Best Tracfone, Ever!
This is a feature phone, not a smartphone.  It isn't an Android (R) or iPhone (R) and cannot use their apps.  To get apps for this phone, you go to getjar. com.  There are some good ones to choose from. What it has:1.  A working calendar that you can set up on your home screen.  Days with appointments appear in yellow;2.  A good contacts database;3.  A QWERTY touch screen keyboard (text messaging and Opera Mini only;4.  Nice weight and feel to the phone;I bought this phone for a friend of mine and she loves it.  She's been through about 3 Tracfones and this one is, by far, the best! There is a learning curve, but once you master the phone, everything falls into place.  I highly recommend this phone. And TRIPLE MINUTES FOR LIFE!  Shut the front door!  What are you waiting for?
