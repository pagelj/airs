My first smartphone
This is my very first smartphone, after my old phone died about 3 days ago. I got the Fusion2 pay as you go phone, and I honestly love it. I bought it at my local Wal-Mart for $80. A replacement for my crappy old phone would be $160, so I decided to try this one out. I love all the features and the fact I can get on the internet and Facebook! My favorite feature is the swipe keyboard, since my fat fingers kept hitting the wrong button or changing the language all the time. The colored lights that tell you what you've received are neat. Such as a text lights up green or a Facebook notification lights up blue. The camera works just fine for me, I think the quality is good. I don't see why everyone is complaining about it. The phone size is good and fits perfectly in my hand (almost). I haven't tried the built in apps like the GPS or anything, but I hear they work pretty well, and I definitely need a GPS because I'm always lost. Honestly, if this is your first smart phone, I think you'll enjoy it. I know I did!
