Fashion vs Function
Lets, start with the good: This case is beautiful. It really looks like a piece of art and has a architectural quality to it. Now the bad: The cover on it swings freely and is annoying. Texting with your phone horizontally is impossible with the cover. The sharp edges jab your leg if you keep it in your pocket. The very limited instructions tell you to place the supplied protective film on the face of your phone but it is die cut for the back side. The only way to keep your phone from sliding freely out of the case is to bend the metal ( per the instructions ) . And finally, the case seems to have cut my reception in half.  All this is a bummer because I really enjoy my other CRKT products.
