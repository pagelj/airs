Great book. Scary look into a possible future if the censors get their way. One of several books assigned to high school students which intrigued me.  Several selections in the high school cannon are introspective of the human character.  The value of this theme is obvious considering the carefree attitude most of the youth have today.  The afterword and the Coda point out some interesting things about rewriting books to include everyone. We don't have to be politically correct ALL the time, especially if it is read it in the historical context it was written. Look at Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer.
