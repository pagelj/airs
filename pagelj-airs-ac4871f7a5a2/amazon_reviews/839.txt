POOR RECEPTION
Reception is poor when radio is plugged into a power source.  I expect to keep the radio plugged into a power source at all times, no sense in having one that when you need it the most, it is dead.  I have ordered the Midland Consumer Radio WR-120EZ NOAA Weather Alert All Hazard Public Alert Certified Radio to replace this one.  At least I know it works when the power supply is plugged in.  I will keep this Ambient radio, and throw it into a camping bag.
