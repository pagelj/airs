Great backpack!
I've struggled in the past with comfortably (or UNcomfortably more often than not) toting around my camera gear to the national parks I love visiting so much, but this backpack has made all the difference. I can fit all the camera gear I need with room to spare for the water and food I need to bring with me on my hikes. Can't wait to take it on my next overseas trip....
