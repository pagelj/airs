OK FOR THE MONEY! BUT JUNK IN THE END
Let me start out saying I LOVE PANASONIC! But this thing is a piece of crap! The menu's are SLOW! Netflix crashes often! You need to pull the power plug to kill the power so you can restart the player. I would love to say this thing was even good, but it's not. If you just need a region free blu-ray player then get this unit. If your buying it for any of the other features... Don't waste your money on this! Spend a few dollars more and get something good! Ultra disappointed
