Bought this to use in the car and is great does rhe job. Also great use in the house for those small messes. Was worth spending a little kore for a kore sturdy poweful vacuum with accessible waste managemnt. Very easy to clean. I would reccomend simply vaccuming the filter with another vaccum rather than using soapy water as water tends to leave grime. Amitoj
