My Dad's annual Christmas gift
I purchase this anthology for my Father every year for Christmas.  He loves it.  Like dad says, "Some stories are better than others." but he looks forward to receiving every year.  I purchased the other anthology that comes out annual one year, but dad says this one is his preference. Excellent gift for any fan of Science Fiction - especially those like my dad who grew up in the time when Asimov, Clarke and Bradbury were first publishing.
