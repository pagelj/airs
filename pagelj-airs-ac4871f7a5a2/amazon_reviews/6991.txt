Awesome lens!
FOR THE PRICE, you can't beat this amazing little lens. I find that if shooting at f/1.8 the focus is a little soft, but if I up to f/2 then it's a lot better. Again this is something I can live with for the price of this lens. I use this primarily for portraits and it does fantastic! I could go on and on about this lens, it's great! If you are on a budget and need a good lens for portraits, this is the lens!
