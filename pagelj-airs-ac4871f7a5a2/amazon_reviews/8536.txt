Don't be scared. Tech help sets it up for you.
Like the title says. I am by no means a whiz but capable in dealing with set up of the Wi-Fi home entertainment gear, printers, etc. That allowed me to get the camera working wireless from my PC. I was totally lost when looking at the set up for connecting via the web. Called tech support and Andrew had me log into Foscam for remote access to my PC. At that point it was just a matter of kicking back and listening to Andrew explain each of the steps as he executed them on my screen. Andrew tested the camera and showed me the web address for logging into the camera. He was kind enough to type up a notes page with that information along with instructions on setting up my iPhone after installing the app and put it on my desktop. Andrew was also so helpful as to open this page for my review which he asked that I include his name. So here I am and this will deserve a follow up because.. I want to see about the motion detector function with an alert sent to my phone. sure other questions will arise. Pros: Don't be silly and worry about set up. They very efficiently do it for you without making you feel like an idiot as some jackass we all know from IT support at work. Cons: Will let you know...
