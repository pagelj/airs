Rough but it works
i've only used it one day so far, but for the price it's great. The sliding action is rough and it's clearly not a rock solid instrument nor a highly accurate and delicate one. I plan on using it for working on my car and household tasks like measuring pipe ID and OD.  So this is great for that. I'll update if the durability becomes questionable.
