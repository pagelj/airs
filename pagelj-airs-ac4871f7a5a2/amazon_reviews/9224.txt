My daughter bought this vac and raved about it so I tried it out.  She has lots of bare floors and I have some bare and some carpet. The machine switches from bare floors to carpet and back again very well and when you clean bare floors it does not blow dust out and away across the floor. I knew my carpet needed a deep down cleaning as we live in a sandy area and it really pulled up the fine dirt out of the shag. It fluffed up the shag carpet so that it looked new for a week or more, even in traffic areas. It is a little hard to push on the shag but I am old and not so strong any more. Sure glad I bought it.
