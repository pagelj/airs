Awesome cables at a price that's practically theft
I had just upgraded my tv to a 51 inch 1080i and gotten a PS3.  Understandably I wanted to make the most of both but was a little short on cash after buying them.  I was a little skeptical of this particular cable because of the price but decided to go ahead anyway to save some money.  I couldn't be happier.  This cable is far superior to the composite that came with the playstation and astoundingly also far better than the component cables I have for my Xbox360 (and those cables are very nice).  The biggest improvement, unless you are willing to start buying HD-DVDs or Blu-Ray Discs, is the sound.  The audio went from a very good and full stereo effect to better than many surround sound setups I have heard.  If you do start getting the new HD movies you will also see a dramatic difference in picture quality with these cables.  Well worth ten times the price or more.
