another great book
This was my 4th book by Francine Rivers. I normally read mystery books. I'm so glad I was told to try her books. So far they are wonderful and can't wait to start another one. I'm not going to discuss what the book is about as sometimes reading others comments turn me off. I recommend this and other books of hers highly.
