Lamb of God....
Sweetest little lamb. It works, the sounds are soothing and I love that it is small enough to take with you anywhere. And it came with batteries installed. Thats a real plus. It is all ready to wrap and give as a gift. I dont recommend that you let your small child sleep with it or hold it as it's not really meant for cuddling but rather for it's soothing sounds. And so sweet to look at. A little pricey but worth it for any parent who wants to help their child be comfortable and soothed.
