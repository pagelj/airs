Exceeded my expectations
I saw this item several months ago and thought it seemed gimmicky, but I sprung for one when my old toaster quit working.  Oh. My. God.  I love this thing!  The egg comes out perfect, and on low setting an english muffin is just warmed, not toasted.  Just the way I want it. Before this, breakfast consisted of a Diet Coke.  I never took the time to fix breakfast, and never bothered to stop and buy anything along the way to work either.  But this thing is perfect for my morning routine ... and weekend lunch ... and late night snack.
