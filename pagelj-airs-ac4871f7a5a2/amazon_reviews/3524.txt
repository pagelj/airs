One note of caution
I read the other reviews and saw many that talked about it not fitting and not responding to the stylus.  But also saw others that said it worked fine, so for $5 thought I'd try. Before trying to place it on the screen I laid it over the screen and it fit within just fine.  It has 2 sticker "tabs", one for peeling off the backing and one on the front of the screen-cover itself. The backing peels off easily and I got the cover on so it looked pretty good and turning on the LeapPad it responded to the stylus and also just using a finger to select. BUT - the tab on the front of the cover I tried to peel off and the adhesive was stuck badly on so that when it peeled off there was paper left behind (hate that).  So I tried to use alcohol wipes to remove it while it was on the LeapPad, but it got underneath.. So then I removed it and this was doable but bent the corner that I pried up. The alcohol only got off the paper but wasn't enough to remove all the adhesive -- so WD40 and Windex did the trick.  But since I already had the backing off I "stuck" it to a wall mirror and bent that other corner. Even so, it's now on the LeapPad and with the screen/tablet on it looks ok. But -- I'm ordering one more because I really think a cover is worth it but would like to try to have it look good rather than just ok.  I will work to remove the front tab while the backing is still on. Will also buy and try something like Goo Gone, that I hear works but haven't tried myself.
