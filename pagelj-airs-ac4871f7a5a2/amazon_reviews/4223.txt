Updating Blu-ray doesn't help for my two Samsung players!
I purchased the original Blu-Ray of Pandora and had no problems at all watching it on both my computer's Blu-Ray Samsung SH-B083L drive and on my Samsung BD-C6500 player but this latest version simply will not play at all on my PC. On my Blu-Ray player for my TV it played part way through and then stopped and refused to play again! I have no idea if it is a disk issue or a Samsung issue but it did play at least some of the disk! What gives? What I saw was wonderful. I love the new beginning and having read the script that was put out there back in January I have no idea why this original beginning was changed for the movie to the rather dull fly over stuff. The beginning on the longest version is true to the script. I saw a few scenes that were not in the original version which I liked but I didn't get to watch the entire movie! I ensured that both my PC Blu-Ray drive and my Blue Ray player have the most up to date updates out there so I'm very disappointed that I can't watch this flick! Perhaps in time I will be able to but if is a disk defect how on earth am I supposed to tell that in time to exchange it at the store? GRRRRRR!
