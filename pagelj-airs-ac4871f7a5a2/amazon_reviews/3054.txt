Woohoo.... This machine worked perfectly.... got a bunch of red wine and Jello stains out of the carpet and was very easy to use.  It feels like a quality machine... have owned a Bissel Steam cleaner in the past but left it at my old house for them to use.... Chose this one due to needed something quickly and saw that Best Buy is running a 4 day pre Black Friday Sale in which this machine is marked down to $99... with a $50 gift card I had from someone... I paid $50 bucks for a good steam vac that took care of what I thought was going to be impossible to get the stains out! Am very very happy with this purchase.
