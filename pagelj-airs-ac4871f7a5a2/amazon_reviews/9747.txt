Good compromise of size and power.. effortless communications
I admit to being hesitant to spend $300+ for a flash.. it was worth it. Read the clear instructions, pushed a few buttons, attached it to my D5100 and instant communications. No fiddling, no set up other than setting it to auto, slip it on, lock it down, perfect exposure. Bounce it off the ceiling or wall indoors, use it as fill outdoors, the camera and the flash have communicated each and every time with great results. I tried the $59 to $99 dollar 2nd and 3rd party flashes with poor to mixed results, could have saved myself a fair amount just purchasing this first. ( I'll never learn, I have three of a lot of things)It is powerful enough for the average to advanced consumer, has amazing recovery speed from flash to flash. If you're indoors with a few lights giving half the light you need it'll recharge fast enough to expose the 4 shot burst in a second my D5100 outputs. Other than the battery door it's solid and robust (dropped a couple times and keeps on flashing) just take care with that battery door. One more thing the SB-700 thrives on standard eneloop rechargeable batteries. I have a host of different rechargeables both low discharge and regular high capacity rechargeable. Of all the different brands and types I've used the eneloops are outstanding in terms of number of flashes and recovery time. Don't use regular alkaline batteries unless it's an emergency... the SB-700 will eat them like candy putting a dent in your wallet. One of these La Crosse Technology Alpha Power Battery Charger, BC1000 and a set of these eneloop NEW 2000mAh Typical, 1900mAh Minimum, 1500 cycle, 8 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries and you'll have all the power you need.
