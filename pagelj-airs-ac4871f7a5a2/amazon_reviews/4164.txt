terrible do not buy!
Do not buy this DVD player; it is horrible! We bought ours from Target and the remote control worked for a couple of days and now doesn't work. The discs get stuck in the dvd player and you have to unplug it and plug it back in to get the disk out. Definitely got what we paid for and will spend a little more on the next one!
