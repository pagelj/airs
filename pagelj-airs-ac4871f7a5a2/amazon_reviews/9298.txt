Worked great till about a couple months ago when it started malfunctioning.  "Toast" would be selected but it would keep cooking even after the timer ran down.  My bagel caught on fire while I was getting dressed for work the other day.  Needless to say this piece of crap is going in the trash.  If you're looking for a product that will last, I recommend paying a few extra bucks.  I should have put this $30 towards a quality product.
