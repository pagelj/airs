I wanted a bagged vacuum that wasn't too heavy and had great suction.  This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It self-adjusts for carpet, floor height and has a Hepa filter.  There are no attached, attachments as a separate vacuum is included for those tasks.  There are the standard attachments and it is great for corners, crevices because you don't have to drag the upright around.  The attachment vac has a shoulder strap so carrying this around is a breeze.  If the price seems restrictive it will be worth the extra cost.  I have owned many vacuums and this is by far the best I have owned.
