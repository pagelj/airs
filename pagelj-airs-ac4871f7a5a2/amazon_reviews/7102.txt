Great purse organizer
I've been looking for something to organize the many purses in my closet.  But, I wanted something that would take up as little space as possible yet make it easy to get to my purses.  This works great.  The pockets are large enough for most purses.  Some you have to fold, but thats okay.  I purchased two.  Each holds ten purses, hangs fromthe closet rod and is a great way to organize.  Recommend!!!
