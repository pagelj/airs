Disappointed in quality
Ordered this case right after getting my Kindle Fire when the Fire was first released - it was very pricey (I think there are far nicer cases now for a lot less money).  The leather was also not of good quality (my leather case with the built in light for the old Kindle was of a far better quality).  It seems clunky with the large corner tabs.  I would not recommend this case to anyone.
