Not impressed
After 6 months, one of the units stopped reading DVDs but would still display what the other unit was playing.  At the one year anniversary of the purchase of this product the other one stopped reading DVDs as well.  We let it go the first time since we would still be able to play/watch DVDs as the other unit was still functioning.  Wouldn't you know it, about 1 day (literally) after warranty was out, they stopped working all together.  I would stay away from this one.
