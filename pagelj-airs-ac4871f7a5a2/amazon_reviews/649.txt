Poor Quality
I've had this backpack for 6 months and am disappointed with its quality and durability.  One strap has already begun to rip open and several zippers will not stay closed.  I have not abused this backpack as I've been using it for intermittent travel for work.  I would not purchase this backpack again and would second guess anything from this manufacturer.
