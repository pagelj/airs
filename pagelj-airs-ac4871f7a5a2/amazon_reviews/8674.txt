A good read
The author does a good job of telling a stock " space shooter"  story, complete with the usual stock characters. That said, it is a pretty good story, with some original twists. The opening narrative vividly paints a credible picture of what the society of the earth could become, given the growth of the social policies now in place in most advanced economies. But it is not a political novel, and doesn't beat the reader over the head with any hidden messages. Instead it follows the main character as he tries to escape the drudgery of life in the welfare slums and build a new life for himself using the only alternative open to him, namely the military. It is an interesting, fast paced story, with plenty of good characters. If you are looking for lot of detailed technical explanations regarding FTL travel, and other aspects of space travel, you won't find it here. The author stays focused on the story and spends only the time needed on these details to make the story plausible. No spoilers from me, but I will say the book cries out for a sequel. I really hope we get one, as I would love to learn what happens next. Definitely worth the time and money.
