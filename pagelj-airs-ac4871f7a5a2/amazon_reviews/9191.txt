Works fine.
I was using a horrible Wal Mart waffle maker and couldn't stand it anymore, so I found this nifty machine to do the work.  It browns uniformly from edge to edge, so no dark spots.  What I found out is that with a good waffle maker, the batter that goes into it is that much more important, so I haven't used it to its fullest ability yet.  The only negative so far is that the browning selector knob is very loose and it is hard to know what number it is pointing to.  I tend to ignore the green ready light, choosing to cook by time instead.
