Cannon is a nice value
I would say that tossing these when they are empty may not be inline with Amazon's new greener packaging initiative, and return mailers  may be a cost-effective way to improve overall user experience for this product. I am the satisfied owner of three canon printers  and am a relatively low volume, medium quality printer user. I can't add anything specific regarding the quality of these inks, however I would like to point out that while the price is less on this sight. The regular store does have a very nice recycling program for used ink cartridges of all types however, you get a couple of bucks to apply towards other purchases for each one you redeem.
