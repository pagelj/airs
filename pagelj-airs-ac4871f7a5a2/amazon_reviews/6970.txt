All Region DVD Player - Philips
We researched all region players and felt this one would suit our needs and for a very reasonable cost. We have always been very satisfied with Philips products in the past. As we are British born we like a lot of program DVDs not availbable for the American region.  So far so good, the player has worked beautifully with American DVDs but we have to obtain over the pond DVD to try on it.  We are going to Amazon UK to see what we can find and look forward to seeing some of our favorite programs in due course.
