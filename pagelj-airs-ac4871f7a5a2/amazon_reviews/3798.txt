Always charged
I love this inexpensive charger for my Droid.  It charges my phone and makes a sweet blue light while doing it.  My kids tell me it's "awesome".  Spending as much time commuting as I do, it was probably one of the wisest investments I've ever made... and I'm an investment banker.  Speaking of which... I have to take this call.
