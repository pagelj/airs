I am extremely pleased with it, which I got to replace our Hoover Agility that was leaking.  The F5914-900 cleans about 5 times better and it also leaves the carpet much, much closer to being dry.  It's very easy to use and we actually now keep it handy to quickly clean new stains and spills.  I LOVE IT!!!!
