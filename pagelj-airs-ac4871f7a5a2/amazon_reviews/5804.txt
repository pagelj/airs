After reading the reviews for this vacuum, I was excited to purchase it, but disappointed upon receiving it.  The "v" shaped head only has a strong suction in the middle, so I am not getting the advantage to this design.  As others have mentioned, it is difficult to maneuver, and while others say they get used to it, I am not. It is very awkward, and I find a flat rectangular head (such as on the swiffer vacuum) to provide much easier access to the edges of the floor.  Also, the head falls off pretty easily, even though I did attach until I heard the "click" that should indicate it is attached properly.  Finally, the exhaust is right in the front of the vacuum, and is very strong. As I moved it along my kitchen floor towards my fridge, the strong wind from the exhaust blew off all the magnets and the things they were holding on the front of the fridge!..  All in all, I consider it an okay vacuum. It does successfully suck in dust and fur from my hard floors. But it is nothing special, and had I paid more than $45 for it, I would be very upset.
