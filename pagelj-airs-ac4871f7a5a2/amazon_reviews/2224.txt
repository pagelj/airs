I had this labtop for about 4 weeks now and i have to say everything is running great so far and the feel of it feels strong but sleek... the windows 8 is a blessing to me (especially coming from windows xp).  I havent had any of the issues the complainers had about windows 8, like not being able to find anything and taking days or even weeks to figure out how to navigate programs or even find the shutdown option... everything has been quite easy to find and access... to me windows 8 was actually designed to make a complex system very easy to navigate and that's how it feels and this asus laptop definitely helps... I am very happy with this product so far
