The New Low Light King!
If you are familiar with the Canon T4i then you are already almost up to par on the 6D. I own the T4i and decided to go full frame with the new 6D. A lot of the T4i's menus and settings are closely akin to 6D's. I personally don't mind that the 6D doesn't have the fold out screen since I rarely used it on the T4i anyway. I do miss the touch screen however. The full frame advantage of the 6D at this price is awesome. I still use the T4i for most of my telephoto work since a crop camera provides a much longer work area. I also sometimes use the T4i for my macro work when I want a tighter shot. BUT the low light shooting ability of the 6D and the much brighter viewfinder will knock your socks off! The 6D is a low light king! The 6D's ability to shoot with lowlight and it's noise level at a minimum is simply outstanding... it outperforms all present competitors! The ISO performance is far beyond the T4i also. One reason I don't think the 6D even needs a foldout screen is because the ability to use iPhone or iPad as a control is really nice. Also the software that comes with the kit makes it possible to control the camera from a wifi connected laptop also. The GPS stamping is also top notch... and the mapping software is really nice. The feel of the 6D is also quite similar to the T4i being only a bit heavier but the weather seal on the 6D is an advantage also. So, all in all .... I have a great crop camera in the T4i... and a terrific full frame in the 6D.
