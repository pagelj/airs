I purchased this vacuum December, 2010, due to the high percentage of glowing reviews and the extremely small percentage of negative reviews.  Back then, only one or two people said it was hard to push.  I thought, "this will make a perfect gift."  Wrong!  The vacuum doesn't have a height adjustment, so if it is operated on medium plush carpet, it will be very hard to push. I think I read well over 100 reviews before purchasing. I am not disputing that many people are happy with this Hoover. It has a beautiful fit and finish, it's light weight and it has terrific suction.  If, however, you have medium plush or thicker carpet, please read all the negative reviews on Amazon and you'll see that several other customers experienced the same difficulties with pushing it.  To reiterate, this vacuum has no height adjustment and will be a problem with medium plush carpeting. The reason for the 4-star rating:  Since most people have low pile carpet, the vacuum will work fine for them.  If, however, you have medium plush carpeting, don't even think of buying this vacuum! Edit -  December 5, 2011Correction:  Hoover advertises the vacuum as having an "auto height adjustment."  Too bad, at least on the vacuum I purchased, it doesn't adjust properly.
