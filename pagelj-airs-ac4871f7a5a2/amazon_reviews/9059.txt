Thomas Stone Weaves a Captivating Storyline with first in Harry Irons' Trilogy, "To the Stars
This is an exceptionally well developed traditional science fiction. It describes a probable future for human space travel and our encounter with two other intelligent life forms, one primitive and one more technologically advanced than humans from earth. I also liked his premise that it will take corporate profits to really fund space exploration. As much as I love fantasy, it was a real delight to read such an interesting story line. The characters were fascinating. One of the best parts about this book is that I found the protagonist likeable quickly so that my interest in his story pulled me along. I found the whole cast believable and generally likeable. I admit to being fascinated with the mission commander's forbearance with one character though. I would have probably confined her to the brig, which they didn't have. Thomas Stone provided everything necessary to a good yarn: challenges and tests to be overcome, idealism, realism, greed, self-interest, egocentric characters, noble individuals, romance, character conflict, variety of personalities, surprises, and interesting cultures. I found only one minor annoyance: words often broke with hyphens. I assume this was due to using the soft hyphen in Microsoft Word. It becomes a hard hyphen, in my experience, when cut and pasted into some other document format, like text. This is such a delightful read that I am eager to continue the trilogy. I'm buying the sequel today. To The Stars (The Harry Irons Trilogy)
