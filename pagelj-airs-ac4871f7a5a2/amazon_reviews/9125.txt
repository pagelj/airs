A Good Read
I was looking for a break in sci-fi when I downloaded this book.  Turned out to be alittle like X-files which was fine.  Anyways, the book is pretty good.  The character development is compentent but slightly predictable.  The inclusion of a cat as a supporting character seems to hint at obvious influences on the author.  A descent book overall but not something that you later say was an awesome book.  Worth your 99 cents.
