I have a Shark Navigator that worked for a few months before stop working. I called the customer service for the problem. I spent one hour and 20 minute and spoke with four representatives. Each time after repeating the same procedure, I was told to be transferred to an expert handling the problem, and the same game started over again. At the forth person, I was experience enough that I could tell what was going to happen, then the representative changed the response slightly that the (computer) application was not working, so I had to call again and try another representative. It seems that that was how the representatives were trained to handle product problem like this.
