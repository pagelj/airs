Nice emergency radio
We used this radio during an extended power outage due to Hurricane Sandy.  With only one winding session, it kept its charge for hours and kept us in the know on what was going on with the storm.  We've purchased one or two similar products in the past that wouldn't hold a charge at all, so this one was worth the money.
