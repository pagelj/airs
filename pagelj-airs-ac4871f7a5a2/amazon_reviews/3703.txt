Don't Waste Your Money
I purchased 4 of these because I needed something on the go when doing a photoshoot off-site. The concept is great the implementation sucks. The product is poorly constructed (the plastic bindings that hold the velcro strap breaks after one or two uses (this occured on all 4 items) making the product useless) - I wrote Opteka to complain but never heard back from them. I got what I paid for 4 cheaply made products for a cheap price. That's the problem with buying online - you don't know what the quality is until after the purchase (sucks being me).
