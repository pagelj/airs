Loved Wool, Kindle version is a steal
I picked this up based on the other reviews here and the fact that the Ombnibus is generously priced at only $5 for Kindle.  No regrets, and frankly the $5 price is a steal for us readers.  The story becomes more engrossing volume by volume, even though the focus of each segment often moves to new or different characters.  I did feel the action and tension slipped oh-so-slightly at the end, but that doesn't change the fact that Howey's done a great job of fleshing out interesting protagonists and antagonists, as well as a "new world" that's fascinating to explore (level by level, as it were).  I certainly hope there's more to come from the world of Wool.
