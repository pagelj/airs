Designer Inspired London Office Tote
I can say that after receiving multiple handbags from different amazon companies, this is by far my favorite.  The color of the bag is just gorgeous and the size is exactly what I was looking for.  I have seen this bag and own one similar to this with a middle divider pocket and I was pleased when this one arrived and I noticed it was wide open on the inside.  It makes it much easier to grab things out of and to put back in.  The quality of the material is amazing and it has one of the best faux ostrich finishes I have seen available.  Overall, you will not be disappointed for the price if you are looking for a great quality, large size handbag or work tote.  I like big bags so I would use this everyday, but it could also carry work folders, a laptop, or books.
