Poorly edited, few "masterpieces"
You would expect a book with this title to include truly great stories, which it does, but they are very few in number. The book is divided into three sections, Golden Age, Silver Age, and Modern age. The Golden Age stories include some of the classics in the field by Clarke and Heinlein, as well as  truly great masterpiece by Lloyd Biggle Jr, "Tunesmith". The Silver Age section has a few good stories by Niven and Turtledove, but the modern age section is completely missable without a single worthwhile story in the bunch (including at least one Hugo winner). Where this book really falls apart is in its poor and sloppy editing. The introductions to each story consist entirely of rambling bibliographies of each writer, with nothing from the editor to explain why it is felt this particular story belongs in this collection. Isaac Asimov was one of the preeminent writers of the Golden Age, yet the story used in that section was written in 1986 (and it was not one of his masterpieces). The introduction to Larry Niven's story is riddled with factual errors. One story in the Silver Age section is even pure fantasy, without any attempt towards science fiction at all. I rated this book with three stars instead of two or even one because it does contain a few fantastic stories. Unfortunately, it is just not a very good book.
