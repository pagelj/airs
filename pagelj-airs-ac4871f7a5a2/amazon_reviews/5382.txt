Great Military SciFi
I loved this book and most of the others in the series.  Good action,  characters with depth and actions with consequences.  From a writing  perspective, I think the first 3 or 4 are the best.  The last two have a  derivitive feel and lost the edginess of the first few books.  I really  like the universe that David Weber has put together here with the interplay  of the technology.  Space combat has the feel of the Age of Sail only in 3D  (well, as in most such books, really 2 1/2 D).
