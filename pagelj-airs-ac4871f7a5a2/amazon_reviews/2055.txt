Very good Product
The only drawback was that it took almost 3 weeks (19 days exactly) to get here from China. It DID come with tools (minus flathead screwdriver) to get the job done which was great, although the phillips screwdriver does not work very well, and it would save lot of time if you have your own!! The screen fit perfectly on my Verizon 4s and was fairly easy to install (but be prepared to spend good 1.5 hour or so working with intricate equipment, and if you make slight mistake you might have to start again). The screen does not come with ear mesh or the home button - had to use the ones from the old screen. The phone works normal as of now, and the only difference i have noticed is the color contrasts are not as great, and it sort of has a slightly dull apearance. However It is not very noticeable and i am sure i will get used to it in a few days. I cannot complain based on the price which is 1/4 of what they asked me at the store to replace the screen!!!
