A good read
"Frozen Sky" is quality science fiction. The frozen world of Europa is a natural setting for a sci-fi novel, and the world is well explained and described. I won't belabor my point any further, it is definitely worth anyone's time and money. Read it! Now, a few criticisms (danger spoilers!): If I was trapped in Europa, I wouldn't make a AI out of my recently deceased friend, especially when experience and protocol tell me an advanced AI will use my super space suit to touch me in an inappropriate manner then turn the interior of my suit into a microwave oven. If Lim had uploaded his AI program as he faced certain death while hanging from a cliff or some such, I could buy that. But voluntarily hacking together a possible Hal AI strikes me as foolish and unnecessary. There are a few pictures in the novel that are amateurish and a bit ugly. The maps don't do anything for the story either.
