Great memory card, great price
I have been using this card in my video camera pretty regularly since my twins were born this past April .... aside from transferring video occasionally to my computer, there is always a tremendous amount of memory always available and you can never go wrong with SanDisk...... and on top of that, over 50% percent off sweetens the purchase....
