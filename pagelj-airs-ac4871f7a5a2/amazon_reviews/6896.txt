Can't Believe I Didn't Do This Sooner
I have owned a lot of really nice monitors.  I use an Apple MacBook Pro and have had Apple monitors and then some.  I used the Spyder 2 Express to calibrate my MacBook Pro today and what a difference it makes.  I always thought the default display was the way Apple set it up, so that's the way it should be.  In fact, I judged my new Dell 2408WFP monitor against my MacBook Pro display and found the Dell to be very saturated. Now, it's a fact that that monitor is very saturated out of the box, but looking at the uncalibrated MacBook display I thought the Dell would have to go back because it was horribly saturated.  When in reality, my MacBook Pro display was simply dull and lifeless.  That isn't to say that the Dell was correct, only that the MacBook was muted and not vibrant, or contrasty in any way.  I fixed that in 10 minutes with the Spyder 2.  My display is now gorgeous.  The colors pop, but are not saturated, the contrast is beautiful and the whole thing just seems more lifelike to me.  I can't wait to get the Spyder 2 home to work on my Dell 2408WFP which I have played with and gotten great results with, without this tool. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for more lifelike colors, better contrast and more control over the default settings from the manufacturer.  The manufacturer's settings are nothing compared to what this creates.  My only problem is that this version doesn't control Gamma and I think that's the main issue with the Dell 2408WFP.  We'll see.
