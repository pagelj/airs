Lumix Camera Review
Purchased this camera after a lot of research on durable small camera's for my husband.  I was looking for a camera that took quality digital pictures of things standing still, moving objects/animals, and a camera that took quick pictures to get those moving objects.  I purchased the 32GB SDHC digital card for use, which was a little overkill, but it can hold over 4,000 pic's using the 16MB quality. Decision Points- Quality Pic's - from color to contrast is awesome.- Shutter Speed allowed me to get great pic's of objects moving clearly... to include a Tomahawk being thrown.- Easy to use, hooked right up to my MAC- Zoom for what I want to use it for is good, I will give up distance for the quality of pic's. (I would NOT recommend this camera if you are taking pic's of your child's soccer game and they are across the field, quality will be good but it won't be a closeup picture.)- Battery Power - I did not put the battery on a time; however, after a few days of taking pic's on and off through out the day I had to recharge the battery.  I plan on purchasing an additional battery.- I have NOT tested the waterproofing, I am sure my husband will drop it in the water soon enough to give a review on the waterproofing.  (Rated at 16Ft for 60min)- The camera is also rated at 5Ft for Anti-Shock Performance (again another good thing with my husband)- The camera is also rated at a temperature between 14deg F to 104deg F. This camera will be used anywhere from Alaska to Afghanistan so temperature variations was also a factor in our purchase of the Lumix.- It is a small camera that can easily fit in a hunting pocket out in the woods or in a combat vest pouch when deployed. Overall we are very happy with our decision to purchase the Lumix, it does everything we need it to do for our active lifestyle.
