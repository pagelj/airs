GREAT!
This is much better than Samsung Intercept I had for awhile, this phone helps me out with a lot of things. Kept me up with college emails and what not. Wish this phone was out sooner.  Greater sound quality to music and watching videos, there are endless of possibilities. Love this phone! I like this over Iphone since I'm more of an actual button user for texting and I do like touch screen but I got to have both. This is a win-win for me. I'm Deaf/HoH.
