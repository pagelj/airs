Nice oven toaster!! Love it!!
This toaster oven was what I had been looking for. I used the regular toaster machine before. However, when I need to just quick bake, it is too hard to use the big oven. This toaster oven is very useful every morning even I can bake the cookies. There are several options that you can choose like the bake style. It is very helpful to have that. If I were you, I would very much like to buy this. There are so many brands out there. This brand is a reasonal price and great quality.
