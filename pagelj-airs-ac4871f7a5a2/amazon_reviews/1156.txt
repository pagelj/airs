Star i9220
It`s a nice phone, have android 4.0.4 installed.  Easy Root, install 16gb sd and configured to move apps.  After that is posible to install a lot of apps, but the internal 512mb Storage is limited. Screen looks sharp and very good, only negative is have some bright backlight, so black is not really black. Phone is fast, very responisive, memory is enough for normal use, big screen is very nice and easy to read.  Also install an app to change DPI to 210 and looks even better, just browse google for info. So far 4 days usign phone, battery last all day with normal use (email, whatsapp, apps update, some games, gps, music, screen 30-40%, wifi all day on, 3g all day on.3G/HSPA network speed it`s fine, on par of i9100 S2 on same network.  Have not test 2nd simm card, detect network fine and easy, only have to set access point manually, but after that all fine.
