Really Good Value!
Note: this review is being 'qualified' in relation to the very low price I paid for this. That being said, a slightly higher price wouldn't have dampened my enthusiasm for this knife. The Knife:Full tang: the blade and handle are 1 piece of steel, adding to the durability. Full tang is good. As others have stated, it REALLY must be sharpened; the good news is, I had no problem putting an edge on it. The Sheath:Tough green nylon material which seems pretty resistant to abrasion; only time will tell, but seems well made. The(free)striker/fire starter:Seems to work just about like any other one. Good to go. All in all, I really like this, and am perfectly happy with this(very economical) purchase.
