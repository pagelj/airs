Wow... what a great recorder!
It HAS a timed recorder function so if you have it connected to a radio that is playing then if you want to record a radio show like I do every night from 1am til 5 am, then it does it on its own. The next day, you can listen to the show in your car on the way to work or whatever. It does everything very well, except for playback audio volume being a bit lower than the last Olympus voice recorder I had. I really like the way it can be plugged in and recharge the batteries and how long the recorder will run on the charged batteries before requiring another charge. Also, even while I am recording at the lowest resolution rate to get the most time since all I am doing is recording a radio talk show, the recording sounds wonderful even the music is very clear as well. I am amazed! This unit is much better than my last one which I lost in Las Vegas. It cost about 1/3 more than the old one, but is more than worth it. I am a customer for life! Thanks Olympus.
