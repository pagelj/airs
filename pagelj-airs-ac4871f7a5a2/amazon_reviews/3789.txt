Nice for the price
I bought these (3) cables to connect up my hdmi equipment. I try to go for a bargain on everything. With the prices of these cables in the stores I figured I would order them and try them out. I was a little surprised to see the quality of the cables. I figured cheap cables cheaply made, but they're actually well put together and tough. Everything I hooked up with the cables is running very nicely, no crackling or interference. Would definitely recommend to anyone trying to save money on hdmi cables compared to the stores.
