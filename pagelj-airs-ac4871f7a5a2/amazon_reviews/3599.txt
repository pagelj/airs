Kids love their animal lunch bags!
Very cute bag and the kids love it, but it would be an even better product if it came with straps so the kids can wear it on their backs.  We take it to the beach, parks, and pretty much anytime we go outdoors during the summertime to keep the kids' food and drinks cool.
