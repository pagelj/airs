There is only ONE SADE
By far one of the very BEST LIVE CONCERT DVDs in my library!  Though often "forgotten", SADE is a BAND, not just the voluptuously talented lead singer.  This DVD takes the opportunity to showcase ALL of the members' considerable musicianship layer upon melodious layer.  Equally stunning is the cinematography done by none other than the contemporary Queen:  Sophie Muller.  BraaaVAAA!!!
