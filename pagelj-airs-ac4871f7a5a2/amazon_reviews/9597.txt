Wired review
Plot was far fetched.  Characters were predictable.  Some interesting passages about Neuro biology.  Typical thriller-- plot kept the reader on edge--lots if twists and turns,especially at the end.  Surprise plot twists still need to be believable though-- even taking into account the bit of sci-fi element in this story-- the plot twists were just too contrived.
