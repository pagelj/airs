Lots of power in a little package
I used this to power my RAZR MAXX phone (which itself has a huge battery), and I was able to charge it 3 full times from less than 25% each time.  This got me through just about a week of travelling and minimal to moderate use. I should mention though, that this unit will turn off after it's reached 100% on the device.  So be warned that it won't just continually charge your phone/tablet (unless you're constantly using the device, keeping it from getting to 100% charged). The only downside is that it uses s standard brick charger instead of USB to charge itself.  It just means one more power cord to carry, but it's worth it.
