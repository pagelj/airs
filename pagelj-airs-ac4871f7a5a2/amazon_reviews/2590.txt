Almost completely satisfied.....
Pros:1)  Screens are big enough, and the volume is loud enough, so that viewers in the 3rd row seat of my minivan can see when the screens are mounted to the front seat headrests.2)  Easy to use.3)  I like that I can also use them outside the vehicle.  The mechanical design is neat in that it has a little prop-stand that pops out to help the units stand up on their own. Cons:1)  The supplied cable to connect the two units together is too short.  In order to reach the cable is basically straight across from headrest to headrest.  Why not make it 3 feet longer?  It would only cost pennies in mfg costs.  Thankfully I had a longer cable on hand and saw no quality difference.2)  No remote.  It would be helpful to be able to help our 4 year old get his movie playing.
