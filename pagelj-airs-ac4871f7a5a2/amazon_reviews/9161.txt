LG cell phone
I received my new LG cell phone earlier than promised and it's perfect.  It's very similar to my old one thatgot wet so I am very happy.  Did not want a "smart phone" or pay for a monthly data plan so this is perfectfor me.  The battery DID keep falling out, but I got a cover for the phone and that ended that problem.
