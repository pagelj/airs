Poorly written and not worth the time
To be fair, this is Ahmed's first novel. That being said, this is a terrible book. The characters are trite, the prose elementary, the story uninspired. Staring a 4th year graduate student in astrophysics at Cornell, Marc Zemin is painted as a struggling genius crippled by his tragic past. What kind of tragedy did Zemin experience? His parents died, and his girlfriend broke up with him. Marc sheds all other endeavors and tries to construct a time machine. Ahmed wants us to feel sorry for Marc in his academic and personal struggles. Instead, Marc and the rest of Ahmed's characters are flat and uninteresting. If you're looking for new speculative fiction, look somewhere else.
