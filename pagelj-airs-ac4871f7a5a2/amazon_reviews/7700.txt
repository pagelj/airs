Fits Canon A810, Doesn't fit Panasonic LX7
I purchased this case (model TBC-302 FFP) because it was recommended by Amazon to go with my Panasonic Lumix LX7. The LX7 does not, in fact, fit in this case. I understand there is another model that will fit. Luckily my daughter's Canon A810 fit in this case perfectly. It is a fine case, and it has a little pocket to fit a little memory card.
