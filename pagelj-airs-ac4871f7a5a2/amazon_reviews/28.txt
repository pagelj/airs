Great dvd player!!
We got this for our son when he was two to use in the car when we traveled.  He is now three and loves his DVD player. We do use it in the truck, but also just around the house. It is easy enough to use that he can even operate it. The sound and picture are good. He does often hit the open button on the left side, making the dvd player open my mistake. But if you close it it does resume from last memory. The battery time is great on it. We tried the display case that attaches to the back of the seat, but it kept falling, so we just either let him hold it or set it on the console in the truck. We haven't ever used the remote, so I can't comment on how well it works. I did a lot of reasearch before purchasing this and would recommend this to anyone. Great product and the price isn't bad either.
