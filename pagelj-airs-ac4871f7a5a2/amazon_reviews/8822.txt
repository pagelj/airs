Updating now works.
Update 12-29-12.  Gopro website now working for HERO3 white.  Camera uploaded very easily.  Bought the suction cup (tested at 150+ mph) and will throw on the hood of my snowmobile this afternoon.  Still trying to find a cool dog harness to mount on the dog's back and see the woods from her perspective. I read all the reviews and finally decided to purchase the HERO3 White.  It is rather difficult to get the thing out of the box to look for the "quick set up" instructions to find a piece of paper saying to go online for the manual. It ships with the battery not installed so you have to install it like any other camera.  The waterproof case is very sturdy and not intuitive to open.  However the instructions shows you how to remove the camera cover and install the battery on page 23 of 27.  On page 25 of 27 it tells you how to open the waterproof case. The instructions then tell you to update the software and the website stalls or the camera automatically turns of so it doesn't automatically update. I am confident it is a cool and worthy of the price but so far it is a pain in the keester to get updated.  I figure I'll need several more gadgets for this as it comes with nothing but a battery, case and USB mini cable.
