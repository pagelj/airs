My first Blu-ray experience.
This was my first experience with blu-ray.  I didn't see much difference if any. It may have been because I connected with standard 3-plug cables because I only had one HDMI outlet on my TV (2004 model).  I'll try it again with a newer TV with more than one HDMI outlet and see if that makes a difference.
