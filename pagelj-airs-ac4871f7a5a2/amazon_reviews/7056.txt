You can't beat it...
Can't beat the price. These are not top of the line styluses, but what do you expect for the price? However they work perfectly fine, get the job done, and come in many colors. Not sure how they pick out the colors to send you. I got mostly pink with a couple of purple, a blue, and a black, which was fine for me. I gave my husband the blue one, I took the black one and a pink one and gave my mother a pink one. But I thought what if a very traditional guy got all pink ones? In the picture they show an array of colors but in reality they send you whatever they grab? Overall I'm happy, it did take longer to ship than it was suppose to but other than that I like the product.
