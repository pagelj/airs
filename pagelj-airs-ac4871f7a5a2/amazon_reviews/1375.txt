Does not heat properly
I bought this Breville BOV650XL oven from Bed Bath & Beyond.  It looks very nice, well built and expensive.  I set it to 325 degrees for 30 minutes and I put 2 different oven thermometers to check the temp.  When you first turn it on , it goes to a preheating where the top element gets very hot.  Seemed that it would work ok.  The preheating function went off in just a few minutes, both thermometers read 180 degrees not 325 which is what one would think.  I left it on and after 17 minutes the temp was now 300.  This is unacceptable for such an expensive oven.  It is very slow to heat and the temp set does not match the thermometers.  I returned it thinking is was defective.  The second one was the same.  Tomorrow Feb 2 2012 I am returning it and getting a refund.  Pretty oven, poor performance.  Don't waste your money.  If you want to toast bread buy a nice toaster.  I read the Breville website and found that others had the same problem.  I call Breville and was told that that's the way it works.
