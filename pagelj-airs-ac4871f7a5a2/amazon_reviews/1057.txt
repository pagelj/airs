Protects my Kindle Fire GREAT!
When I decided to purchase my Kindle I knew I was going to get a screen protector for it before I even took it out of the box and this has worked great. It is so easy to apply didn't have to worry about any air bubbles and now it's been about 3 months since I first applied it and it still looks like I just applied it.  It also has a matte finish which stops finger prints from staying on there and it is also easy on your eyes. Lining up the screen protector was also very easy.
