Powerful Plug for Kindle Fire, BUT...
If all you want to do is charge up your kindle Fire, just use the charger that came with your Kindle Fire.  If you want to USE your Kindle Fire WHILE you charge it, this is the one.  The white USB cord, which you can also purchase (not included), is just the right length so you don't burn up your battery.  It also works well with a Droid X phone and the X-Mini II Capsule Computer Speaker for the same purpose.  I love it and have several scattered about the house in strategic places.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.
