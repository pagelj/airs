Tricked into believing
The cover does what it's supposed to do.  Period. It's Kindle's choices of colors.  I ordered "Royal Purple" so that I could find my Paperwhite easily. Well, royal purple turned out more like dull, briefcase brown. I was really disappointed, especially given the colors Kindle shows.  Nothing close.  Tricked.
