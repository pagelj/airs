Adequate product.
works fine but I have had better.  Nothing really too wrong. Just have used higher quality ones. Another reason I scored lower is that I bought this for the kid's S3s and it wasn't until I installed the 3rd one that I realized that the tabs on the plastic covers on each side were numbered.  The numbers in the tiny circles were so small it wasn't readily noticeable.  Moreover the tab for removal on each side were exactly the same on each side except for the tiny number inside.  In contrast the new pack of EVO 4G covers that I bought just after these came with one tab blue and the tab on the other side was red.  Given this caught my attention, it was very easy to see that it said remove this side first.  This product isn't like this at all.
