Nice camera for the money
The camera takes very nice pictures, but is a bit slow. If you want to take a pictures of moving objects, or want to take several shots in rapid succession, this camera may not be best for you. If you like taking pictures of yourself, then having an LCD screen on the front of the camera is a plus.
