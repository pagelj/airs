Rating 5 out of 5Whew! Get the hose out because this Momma got a hot flash from reading this novel. If I could rate it higher than a 5 I would and it would deserve every bit of that rating. Crazy casting director hires the hot guy (who secretly sports more than a crush on her) to be her fake fiance. There was steam and blushing and fire and passion beyond what I was expecting from reading the synopsis. Stick a fork in me because Momma is so closing the blinds and taking Daddy to bed!
