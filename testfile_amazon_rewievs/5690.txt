Really should be 2.5 stars
I wanted to love this book, I really did.  I've waited 6 years, and I reread all four previous books (even AFFC) in preparation.  I need not have bothered.  This book was disjointed and disappointing. It started as early as the prologue, which has absolutely no link to the rest of the book, right down to the epilogue, which for some reason introduced a new point of view, if not a new character.  The rest, with the exception of a few very interesting developments, felt like filler. Daenerys, who has always been one of my favourite characters, has no development whatsoever. Jon has great development, until he does something so totally against everything else he's done in the rest of the book that it boggles the mind. Bran is as dull as ever. Cersei and Jaime both have chapters that should, IMHO, have been left on the editing floor. And on, and on, and... At this point, I can't see where the story is going and I'm not sure GRRM does either.  I hope he's not writing for the TV series as many have suggested, but frankly the gratuitous swearing and sex, in a series that has never resorted to that in the past, kind of feels like he is. I only hope the next installment is the last, and that it does not take another 6 years to complete.
