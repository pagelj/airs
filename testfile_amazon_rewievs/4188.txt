From a Pro Photog's perspective, this is a great pocket camera.
I've always been a big fan of Olympus esp. their optics. When I got to know that Olympus released a Compact camera with the Zuiko lens, I was so excited. Bought this just before our holiday to UK. I was very confused whether to take my 5DMKII or this and honestly I'm very glad I took this camera along instead of a DSLR. Some of the brilliant things about this camera:1. F1.8 - f2.5 helps in getting some decent Depth-of-field and clean bokeh and not messy bokeh.2. Image Stabilisation is brilliant.3. The LCD screen's visibility and angle of view is fantastic.4. ND filter for that extra slow shutter.5. Hot shoe for external flash.6. RAW images (. orf)7. Super fast focusing. The time between clicking a picture being ready for the next one is really short compared to other compacts in the market8. Pop-up flash is pretty good. You can actually use slow-sync (1st or 2nd curtain)9. Super Macro is just brilliant.10. The build quality is very sturdy.11. The dials and it's usability.12. Very silent clicking.13. Friction lens capThings that could've been better:1. A little slow at zooming2. Battery doesn't last longer than 200-250 snaps.3. Video is ok, focus is the issue4. Mic is not great5. Shows some sort of vertical lines when pointed at the sun while taking backlit videos, doesn't appear in pictures.6. Proprietary sockets for USB and HDMINow, if you look at the price it's an amazing camera. Now they've released a new CMOS version, I guess it allows you to shoot at higher ISOs. Otherwise this is an awesome camera. Hope this helps.
