Excellent book for beginners
This is an excellent book for someone just getting started in the genre. His do's and dont's are indespensible (even as a refresher course for the  advanced) though his examples are opinionated and dry. But because this is  a book about HOW to write and not why we write, the most valuable  information he shares is the art of conveying the most in as few words as  possible. The masters of fantasy/Sci-Fi know how to accomplish this with  dynamisim and grace. If this is what you want to learn, or you just want a  refresher, then by all means buy the book but do not rely on it as your  sole source of information.
