Not the best construction, but works good.
Kind of a cheap construction, but for the money it's good.  Solar function is kind of crappy and slow, but it holds two full iPhone charges, which you can charge up using your computer, so that works great in and of itself without the solar function, which makes it worth the $ to me.  If you set it in blistering sun for a day, it will charge up, but anything short of that seems to charge so slowly that it's not worth the time.
