Great for when you cant hold your phone.
I bought this headset with the intent of getting rid of wires and making my periodic night runs easier. It did just that. Easy sync and connect to my phone. I even used it for work. I just keep my phone in my pocket or in its case on my hip and the only time I look at it is to see who is calling. I pick up and put the phone back in my pocket and I am hands free to send emails or perform other tasks. Obviously great for those who have to multitask all day long. If I could make this product better, it would just to be in more than one color, a little more stylish when I'm dressed. The headset fits under the collar of my dress shirts so the whole time at work, no one knows I'm even wearing it until I pull out an earphone at my desk.
