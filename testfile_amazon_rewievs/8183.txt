Huge Improvement.
After buying a Nexus 7, my custom firmwared WRT54-g finally couldn't take it anymore. I can't blame it though, it was handling two smartphones (mine downloading podcasts), my tablet (also downloading randomly in the background), three laptops (one video conferencing, one watching gaming), and roku watching Netflix and 1 desktop acting as a server. The RT-N66U handles all of this flawlessly. I really can't say how great this has been especially since everything is so much faster on the network. I'm also happy to report that I'm finally tapping out Comcast for everything it's worth thanks to this router and my Motorola modem!
