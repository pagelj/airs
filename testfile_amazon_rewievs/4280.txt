Perfect!
I bought this in the suggested package deal for the Canon Powershot A4000IS and it fits nicely. Not too bulky as I always keep it in my purse. Great price for this great little protector. Also has a handy pocket on the side to stuff money or my credit cards if I don't want to carry my purse around. Did I mention it comes with a little clip to hang it off your pants if you don't even want to carry it or put it in your pocket?  They've thought of everything!
