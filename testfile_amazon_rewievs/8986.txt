Can't See Enough Value  vs Lumix SZ7.....
My search for a really small but good low-light plus good video camera led me to the WX150 and I bit at it, for all the positive reviews here on Amazon.... The WX150 is not bad, but it is marginally better than my wife's Lumix SZ7, which cost me $129, and no better than my own ZS15 at $189...... The WX150 went back in only a few days. Also, battery life was less than the SZ7, which also has a very thin battery. Color rendition is better than an Elph or the SZ7, but not in every lighting condition. To me, this is almost a ladies or maybe teen camera - the buttons are so tiny... very difficult to operate compared to almost any other small cam.
