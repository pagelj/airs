My parents received a toaster like this for a wedding present over 60 years ago, only this one didn't have handles to take the bread down into the unit.  It lowered the bread down then popped it up when it was ready.  It still works today... what a GREAT appliance.  Today, Cuisinart's answer to this classic design failed soon after the 3-year warranty.  The left side stopped working... so much for innovation, don't bother with it.
