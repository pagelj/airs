forget Apple TV  - this is ALL you need
I purchase this product directly from their website. I  love this roku.  Install Plex Media server on your PC. Install the plex app on it and it runs very  smooth. the Netflix app is the fastest i have used. It is not yet butter smooth, but is almost there. Is very fast compared to everything else outthere. You can install private apps too - think of the fine wine. ;)this little puck is my go to for everything media related. It does not have youtube, but whatever, just use the Plex youtube app or twonky to send whatever video to the device. i would recommend this unit to anyone wanting to try streaming everything from the web. most of the stuff is in HD and it delivers. great buy
