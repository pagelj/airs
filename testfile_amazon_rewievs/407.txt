Yada Yada Yada
This book (and the last) were a drag. This author needs some serious editing! Seems like he is getting lost in the descriptive part of the narrative and the thrust and direction are too diluted by far. Also, we are running out of original protagonists, and I find myself becoming detached from the characters. There are only two I care about any more, and it is getting hard to wade through pages and pages of descriptive nothingness to keep up with them. Not sure I will continue with the series. I feel kind of abused!
