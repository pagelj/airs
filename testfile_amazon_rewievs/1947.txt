Not the cheapest and definitely not the most expensive.  I can't see a reason to spend any more.  Its a toaster for heavens sake not a nuclear reactor.  It does what it's supposed to do, it makes toast.  What more do you need.  The defrost and the bagel features are nice to have and the light and dark adjustment works fine. One tiny thing I will always wonder about, on the darkness scale that goes from 1 to 9 I've found that 7 is what I would consider burnt.  I afraid to set it to 9..... I can only picture what might be considered a burnt offering.
