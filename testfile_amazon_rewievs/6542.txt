Great, for the first two months....
This monitor was probably the best we have tried (and we've tried a few).  However, about a month and a half ago, which was around 2 months after purchase, it started losing its signal.  We have not added or changed any of the electronics in our home, or moved the monitor in any way that might disturb it's transmission.  I didn't even notice it until I heard a loud beeping in the middle of the night and realized it was going in and out, with the image freezing when it would come back on.  With my daughter on a different level of the house from us it is very important to me to have a fully working video monitor.  She has been having nightmares lately, and it keeps me up thinking the monitor is out and I am missing her screaming.  While it is still working maybe half of the time, I would never use it for our newborn, and am looking to replace it for our toddler. My husband attempted to get ahold of the company with no reply, which I was also very disappointed in.  I really wanted this to be the monitor that worked and it was great while it did, but I don't think 2 months is an adequate amount of time for these monitors to last, which seems to be the going time limit at this point. Overall, a great video monitor with nice extra's if and when it works, but quit working properly WAY too soon and a negative for no response from the company to our inquiries.
