I liked this coffeemaker and it's features very much at first, other than thinking that the glass carafe was made of the thinnest glass I had ever seen for a coffee maker. Having noticed that, I was very careful with it, but even so, it broke in my hands while I was gently washing it after about 2 weeks of use, cutting my hand quite badly. I returned it and got the 10 cup version with the steel carafe instead. It was a little smaller than I wanted, and I wasn't sure I would like the steel carafe, having always had glass ones before; but I have been very happy with it, after using it for about six months. So forget the glass version, and spend a little more and get the steel one!
