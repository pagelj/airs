AF works fine
I use this lens with a D50. This lens captures great photos of my granddaughter and her team playing Fast Pitch softball.  The D50 is set to take continuous shots of action on the field.  Very few of the photos are blurred due to the AF ability.  98% of the photos taken are suitable for printing on quality photo paper.
