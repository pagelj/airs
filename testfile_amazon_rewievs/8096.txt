This little red machine sucked two long lost tennis balls out from under the dresser! It is one of my best buys this year! With three dogs and hardwood floors, the accumulated hair during shedding season resembles tumbleweed in Mojave. I have a Miele Olympus Canister Vacuum, an excellent vacuum but for a fast daily dog hair quick cleanup, dragging a canister around the furniture is too much work. I bought a Black & Decker Cordless Pivoting Floor Vacuum earlier this year, the suction power is so weak that using a broom is more efficient, not to mention the constant need to recharge. This vacuum turns out to be perfect for what I have in mind, including I specifically do not want a bagless vacuum. It's lightweight, extremely easy to maneuver, and the suction is amazingly powerful. The overall design is well thought out and functional, the retractable wand is made of metal. It's very easy to wind up the cable at the bottom of the machine, and after each use the already compact canister can be stood up straight and taks even less space. The vacuum bag has surprisingly large capacity, I also bought HEPA filters. Finally, the feature that I love THE MOST is that it's lightweight enough I can easily and comfortably carry it in one hand while I vacuum the tumbleweed throughout the house, without bumping into furniture and corners!! Six Stars!!
