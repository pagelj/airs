Sturdy, easy to mount, and very flexible
I've been highly pleased with this product. First, it was relatively easy to install. Second, it is very sturdy and supports by TV very well. We tug and yank on this without any worry, and we've swiveling the TV around every day for over a year. And finally, it's very easy to move. A friend has a similar product, but his wife can't move the TV alone because with the weight of the TV it's too stiff. However, this Cheetah Mount can be easily adjusted one-handed by a child. I will definitely buy this again if I ever want to mount a second TV.
