Amazing
I did not expect to be so moved by this story, and yet I sit here crying as I come to the end. What a well-written book. I am so glad I stumbled upon it. It's one of those books that you feel like your entire life is changed just by reading it. There really is no higher praise I can give, no greater recommendation. Read this story. Let it fill you up and change you.
