Good basic phone
It's a good, simple touchscreen phone.  Not "smart" but has enough stuff inside for a basic occasional mobile phone user. Texting with the virtual Qwerty keyboard is fair - it's is a little small for big fingers but it works okay. I appreciate the writing recognition option too, especially since I used to have a LG420 with a number keypad. Triple minutes was also a selling point. Other than occasional pocket dial, I like it. And I was able to move the internet browser icon off the main screen so I don't burn up minutes ("units") with accidental touch of the icon. I did buy additional memory to allow more camera phone picture saves, but I didn't realize just how low 2 MP resolution is. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Tracfone's online support (including tutorials to get familiar with the features) is getting better, even though site navigation still isn't great.
