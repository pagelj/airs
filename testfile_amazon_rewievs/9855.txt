Works
Item works, but it struggles to charge my 2009 Macbook pro. It takes many hours to get the job done. My auto is a 2013 Ford Escape. I previously had a 2009 Escape and its built-in inverter did a much better job. This item is also too weak to charge the battery on my 18v drill in a reasonable amount of time. The little fan built into the unit is too loud. You will not want to leave it plugged in on a regular basis. When stopped, the fan is audible over the car radio at a reasonable volume. It's fine to use in a pinch, but the product claims are overstated.
