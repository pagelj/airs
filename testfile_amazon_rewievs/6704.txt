great little camera!
Took this camera on vacation to Punta Cana and it worked amazing! Great for taking pictures underwater. You should buy the chum too so it floats. I used it in ocean and pool and even in a cavern. Very easy to use!  Not the best zoom but for takingwater pictures how far do you need to zoom? I loved it and recommend it to all
