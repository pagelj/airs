Fantastic for a product produced for many situations
This backpack is great, and the only things I have a problem with are minor and have to do with my specific condition, something I don't expect a mass produced product to not have, like the size of the sleeping bad. I stuffed quite a bit of heavy items into the bag when I first got it, but when I put the bag on it put no strain on my back. As a person with back problems, this was very important. I also like all the straps that are built with the backpack. I didn't have to buy bungee cords or straps to tie my sleeping pad to the bottom of the bag. It was a great buy for a first time backpacker.
