Easy to Install
I bought this to protect my great nieces and nephew and I am very satisfied with the product.  It was very easy to adhere both straps to the TV and stand.  The adhesive is very strong and the straps are rugged enough to hold my 46" HD flat screen.  I recommend this product to anyone with small children.
