WASTE of time and money
It is not standard size for the phone. It is far too big and has to be cut down to fit. The tabs are glued or somehow stuck to the backing, so if you cut it down to fit and finally are able to stick the film to the phone (which bubbles relentlessly without being able to smooth), you cannot remove the backing tab. The film is not what it's claimed it to be and is junk. I didn't even want to give it one star but had to in order to post this review.
