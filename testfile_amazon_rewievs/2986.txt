Simple installation for a 47" LED
I bought this mount for my 47" LED HDTV and I have to say that it was painless to put up and really makes our family room a fun place to be. We just wanted a simple way to get the TV mounted on the wall and out of the way. It was fabulous for that. There are only two things that I'd warn people on. First, if any of your plugs come out of the back of your TV, plug them in befor you mount the TV - there isn't any room to work them in otherwise. Second, the bottom screws that secure the bottom edge are really deep and tough to get to without some sort of long screw driver. Make sure that you are all set up and don't want to move it, when you secure it down because it'll be a pain in the butt to take off.
