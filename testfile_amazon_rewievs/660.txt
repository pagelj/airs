Very Good Read
I didn't know what to expect when I first started reading this book, but I knew it sounded interesting. At first it was a bit creepy, but that feeling lessened as I got to know the children more through reading the book. It was really good, in my opinion, and the stories and letters only enhanced that. Some have said that reading the letters is impossible though kindle, but I have the kindle app on my iPad and I simply enlarged the images and they went to their own page until I was done reading, and I x'd out of it and kept on with the book. I hope there is a continuation of this story; I would love to find out what happens next and see what Jacob ultimately decides after the adventure at the end of the book. Very interestingly too is that all of the pictures are authentic. I gave it four stars out of five only because this book could have been edited better. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to grammar and spelling, punctuation, etc. and I noticed a couple areas that had been missed during editing. Other that that, I would definitely recommend this book.
