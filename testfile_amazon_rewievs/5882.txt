looks good on the counter BUT
it is a cheaply-made appliance. I bought it to replace my first Cuisinart toaster which literally fell apart. The raise/lower tabs fell out and one side of the 4-slice toaster stopped working altogether. On the new toaster the dials that control light/dark are so flimsy I question if they really control anything. It doesn't feel like they are attached to anything. It does not toast a bagel evenly. After one session I have to turn the bagels and then toast again. Why did I buy it? I couldn't find a toaster (expensive or cheap)that looked as good!
