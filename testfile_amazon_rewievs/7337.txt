excellent book!
I've read a lot of Atlantis books, but this one is different.  He doesn't overload you on the myth vs reality, but presents an entirely new --- for me, anyway--- way of looking at our past.  What if someone had far superior technology and wanted to help humanity advance?  What if a group of humans got ahold of some of this technology and decided that only SOME humans should advance? The book is very well written and very well researched. My only complaint is that it ends with a killer cliff-hanger and I want the sequel NOW! : )The Atlantis Gene: A Thriller (The Origin Mystery, Book 1)
