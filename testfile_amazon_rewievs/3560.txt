Burning Book
This book is unique in its own way. What goes on in here is not what people usually want to hear. Burning of houses, burning of sacred classics, even burning people. What makes this book likeable is that it makes you step out of your comfort zone into reality. As if it was going to happen if we don't stop doing what we are now. I like this book because of the interesting technology and characters. Clarisse of course is my favorite character. She reminds me of the bright, young, smart, and clever people that live in this world. The main character in this book is of course Guy Montag. He is a fireman, that burns books. Unlike other firemen, Guy Montag is more friendlier. Even Clarisse said so herself. She said he made her forget about him being a fireman at all. Which sets apart Montag from the rest of his group. Which makes him special. What happens is that Montag is apart of the fireman group 451. Being tempted, Montag steals a book, and more and more with each job he does. His captain of course notices, since near the end he said every fireman does this one time in his career. But, soon enough Montag is caught. Therefore being caught, he is forced to be on the run constantly, in fear of the Mechanical Hound, the invention used to catch "criminals." Yet, there is a surprise ending, and to see what it is, you'll just have to read and find out.
