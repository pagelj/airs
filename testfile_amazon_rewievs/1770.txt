The coffee maker worked for about the first 5 brews.  Now, for the past two days, the coffee maker overflows and has made a huge mess.  Simply because the basket holding the coffee grinds was slightly crooked.  What a horrible mess it caused.  Not to mention the frustration.  Please make future coffee makers less sensitive in the grind area.
