PERFECT BATTERIES & CHARGER
This is my second time buying Wasabi batterys and charger for two seperate digital cameras. The Wasabi Li-on batteries charge fast and last for weeks. The Wasabi sales items and list of associated batteries is the first place I look when I buy extra batteries for my digital cameras. I use cameras a lot as a semi-professionalphotographer and alway want to carry one or two extras in my pocket in case one runs down. The prices are cheap compared to manufactures batteries, if they even carry them. I have an off brand GE 16 megapixel camera and Wasabi is the only place I could find extra batteries. They also include a car chager, lighter style, for free. They could probably save manufacturing costs by not including this car lighter charger, but they don't, they include it.
