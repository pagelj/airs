Caution - Inexpensive HDMI cables cannot be used in all equipment setups
When I use this cable to connect either my DIRECTV receiver, and/or my BluRay player directly to my Samsung television, it works fine. However, that was not my intended use. I have an HDMI Home Theatre Receiver between the DIRECTV/BluRay and the TV. With an HDMI receiver in the configuration, The TV video and audio would blink for ~2 seconds, and it would do this randomly. I believe the HDMI handshake signal was getting dropped, causing the blinking. I fixed the problem by upgrading to an expensive HDMI cable from MONSTER.
