Not Really Worth It
Someone else wrote "Bleck" in a review... I couldn't have said it better. For a book that both moved relatively quickly and generally kept my interest, I couldn't help but finish it a feel like having wasted my time. The first chapter alone is full of inconsistencies and then shortly thereafter the main "hero" gets "innocent" Caro into bed by getting her drunk. Great. I can't believe that I could actually like nearly all the characters except the main two. Even if steamy romance is your thing, this wasn't worth the read.
