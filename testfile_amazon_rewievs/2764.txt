Good quality bag with lots of space!
First off I must say what I shove in there in the end of the day.- Canon T3i Rebel EOS- 18-55mm lens- Rode VideoMic- Flip Video Camera- Duct tape (No Hate on the Tape)And with all that i still have room to shove a few other lenses in there, but I've only had it for a day now so we shall see on its first outing. It feels sturdy the straps look well attached and the buckles don't feel like cheep plastic.
