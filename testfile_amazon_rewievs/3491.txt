Very poor execution on a very basic technology
Electric toasters have been around for over a century, and they all basically work the same. Electricity runs through exposed wires causing them to heat up to glowing red and radiating heat. Apparently this technology is too complex for the third-world sub-contractor that Black & Decker has chosen to entrust with its brand name. The heating element wire is very unevenly wrapped around the panels, and it is incredibly light-weight. The result is that it takes a long time to come up to heat, and when it is at full heat output there are cool spots resulting in unevenly toasted bread. It will work for now, albeit poorly, but I anticipate that the light gauge wire will last about as long as an off-brand incandescent light bulb... perhaps six months if I am lucky.
