This is My Second Cheetah Mount
I got my first Cheetah mount for my first ever flat screen in 2009.  That mount is still going strong, now holding up my 55" so I got a second to hold up the 'old' (2009) tv in my bedroom.  These mounts don't feel as fancy-pants as the $100 mounts, but since I don't intend to be looking at or feeling the mount for any extend period of time, these mounts do just fine for a bargain shopper.  You can adjust the tilt of tv a wee bit with some awkward finagling, but these are essentially made to not move once you've decided on a good angle, especially for a larger tv. As far as value goes (quality and price), it's 5 stars. Pros: very durablelasts a long timeholds the tv fairly closely to the wall or you can tilt the top of the tv down a bit1/3 of the price of other mountsCons: Can't adjust the tv easily once it's mountedA little awkward to tighten the brackets
