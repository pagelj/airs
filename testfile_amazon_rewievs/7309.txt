Not what I was looking for...
I was going away to school and needed a new bag. When I got it it just wasn't what I expected. There is nothing wrong with it except it was too big. I'm 5'7" and felt if i would have filled it up with books I would have tip over. Like a said there was nothing wrong with the bag itself it just wasn't a good fit for me.
