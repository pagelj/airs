One of the best Android tablets.
I was one of the early adopters of the Kindle Fire who got caught up in all the hype. It didn't take long for me to find many things I didn't like about it, but I won't mention them here. After giving it away, I decided to get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Believe me when I say that it was a major upgrade. Electronics are just one of many things that I'm very picky about. Having played with a few other Android tablets, I think that Samsung makes some of the best Android tablets. They also previously listened to their customers, and no longer mess with the stock OS. Pros:Depending on how you use it, the Galaxy Tab 2 has a very good battery life (TV shows/movies will drain the battery quickly). The screen is very bright and has excellent color. It's a great deal for the price (it's actually dropped in price since I bought it). Cons:Samsung forces you to have a few apps that I'm sure most people don't want (Next Issue, for instance), and you can't delete them. The included cable is too short. They don't even make a longer aftermarket cable, so I have to use a USB extension. I also think it's stupid that the Samsung cable is almost an exact copy of the Apple cable. Overall, this is a great tablet, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a quality Android tablet. Edit: It seems that a longer aftermarket cable is actually made for the Galaxy Tab 2. I should've searched again before reviewing.
