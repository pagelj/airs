great quality and affordible.
these cables are cheap in a good way. they are cost effective and work just as good as the $50-$80 ones. ive never had an issue with the amazonbasics cables i bought. i have one for each tv in my house, one for each blu-ray player, and one for each console. i have wasted 70 bucks on a name brand one. it looked super cool with extra wire covers and it looked all ruggedized, but to be honest, the cables are gonna sit in the back of your media center. in the end, the amazonbasics cables worked just as good as the 70 dollar one i have. its a no brainer to save some money and get these.
