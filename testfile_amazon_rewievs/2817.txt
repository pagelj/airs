Saved my $150 camera!
This product is fantastic!  We used it on our recent cruise vacation and we would have lost our underwater camera if it weren't for the Chums camera float.  It is comfortable on your wrist, and it actually does float!  I used it with a Fujifilm FinePix XP30 digital underwater camera (which is metal and weighs 5.3 ounces).  I thought that camera would be too heavy, but hoped the bright yellow color would at least make it easy to find.  But when we were snorkeling, I had the camera on a lanyard around my neck, and the lanyard broke... luckily I had the Chums attached to the camera and it actually floated!  I didn't even notice that I lost the camera, but my husband saw it floating behind me.  This inexpensive device saved me from losing a $150 underwater digital camera and priceless photos that were on the memory card.  I highly recommend this great product!  So worth it!!!
