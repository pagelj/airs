WOW!
This book was unbelievable!  I definitely recommend this book to everyone.  Especially, individuals who need something to grab them to continue reading.  I'm a new Christian and was at first skeptical about reading a Christian book.  I thought it would be boring or hard to follow.  However, it strengthed my love for the Lord and my husband.  I look at life very differently now.  I have put this book on my list as my most favorite!
