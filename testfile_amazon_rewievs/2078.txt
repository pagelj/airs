Forget it if you are not in the USA
Well, the product arrived today and of course I was excited. Set up was a breeze and with a little effort I was on my way.... to... well... um.... not much. Roku is obviously designed for the US market ONLY. In order to get anything other than movies and shows that only a whack job would watch, you must be in the US... which I am not. No Netflix.... no sports channels (I have a Netflix account and would pay for others if available)... thus really, this was a waste of $50. I can simply HDMI my computer to the TV and watch Netflix. I think it is irresponsible of ROKU to not mention that most of the channels are available to the US market only. Tempted to send this back... really tempted.
