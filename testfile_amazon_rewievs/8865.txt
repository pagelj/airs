Nice pic quality, horrible camera quality, be aware
I loved the picture quality that camera produced, zoom quality is awesome, but I noticed first problems on a second day of use - lens cover didn't shut down properly. On my second trip in 3 month the lens on/off stopped working. I sent this camera to Panasonic repair center because it was under warranty (had to pay for it of course) and they said they found some sand which means it's not covered under warranty. Sand in SouthWest?! What a surprise! I've been to multiple trips to SouthWest with many different cameras, and none of them stop working because of sand encounter. They offered me to repair it for $180 which is the same price I bought it for. I have upcoming trips to Hawaii and more SouthWest, hence more sand exposure, and it didn't make any sense for me to spend money on fixing something that probably going to stop working again on the next trip - so I got my camera back - lens is still in retracted state, so they didn't make any attempt to fix it. Very disappointing experience, but pictures were very nice, really loved the quality. Too bad that camera is so sencetive to outdoor factors.
