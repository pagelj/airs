This Cuisinart Coffeemaker is perfect for our needs!  The carafe acts as a thermos once the coffee is brewed, and the machine turns itself off.  The thermos/carafe keeps the coffee hot for a long period of time.  I was concerned about some of the reviews that suggest that there is spillage as the coffee brews, but we have not found that to be a problem.  It is important that the top is properly screwed in, and this could be where some of the reviewers were having problems.  My husband says that he wishes the carafe would pour faster, as the flow is rather slow, but it does not bother me. I love it!
