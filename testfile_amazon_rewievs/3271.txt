Excellent for the price
The set up is very logical and easy to navigate.  I have never had a problem with the Wi-Fi connectivity and the Player is on the second floor and my modem is on the first floor on the other side of the house.  remote is easy to use although a little sensitive.  It is slightly noisy but overall a very good buy.
