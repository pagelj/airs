Perfect Companion for your Birdbath or Bird Feeder
I have been very happy with this camera sitting two (2) feet away from my backyard water-feature.  I've used it from early December through the end of February and gotten thousands of medium quality pictures.  In there are eleven (11) recognizable bird varieties and one (1) mammal.  Among the pictures is one that looks like a Robin fussing at an Eastern Grey Squirrel for using her bath, an another features Mrs Blue Jay watching her husband splash around in the tub. It comes with a couple of bungee cords to help mount it to a tree or post, but much more satisfactory is to use a camera mount.  There are a number of mounts specifically designed for this kind of camera, or you can do what I did and roll your own.  The standard camera mount uses a 1/4 inch 20 thread bolt.  I permanently installed a bolt like this near the birdbath resulting in a stable, relatively unobtrusive, installation. If you have a place birds frequent that you would like close up candid pictures of, this is the camera for you.  There is nothing comparable to it on the market, and the next step up would take a custom rig that costs hundreds (or even thousands) more.  There is a version of this camera that incorporates a flash for night observations, I'll get one when I think I can afford it.  Also, there are so-called "trail cameras" that are designed for larger animals.
