Great phone
I love the big screen, now I can wait for a tablet. With the 2 gig of ram and 1.7 gig processor it is super fast.  I was worried about the battery as I get lousy signal in my office and my home, however, when I leave the wi-fi on, it actually saves power as the data plan doesn't drain it anymore.
