Not Very Good
I recently bought this extended battery for use with my ipad.  Product info states that you can get up to 30 hrs of movie time on ipad.  Not true---I only got like 8 to 9 hrs from trent battery pack.  Then I had to recharge the unit for another 5 hrs.  Save your money---I sent it back for a full refund.  I don't understand some of these reviews giving this product a good rating.  Maybe my unit was defective---I don't know but I am not willing to take a chance on this unit.  $80 dollars are $80 dollars---it would have been okay if I could have gotten at least half of the charging time described on product info.  So save your money---this was my experience with this product---if you dare order it and try it for your self.
