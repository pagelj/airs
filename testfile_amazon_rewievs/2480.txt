Really, I couldn't add much more to what has already been said.  I have used it for homemade bread, and the slots are wide enough, and it really does toast "predictably."  Some toasters will, for no reason, burn toast even though the dial is not set very high, but this one really gives you, as Eddie Izzard notably defined it, "Three toast," or "Four toast."The one comment I would make is that when it pops up, it does so very silently.  Sometimes I don't hear it at all, when I'm in the kitchen making other things.  If you're wanting the really loud, get-your-attention sound, a la the Bruce Willis and John Travolta scene in Pulp Fiction, then this toaster probably isn't the one for you. All that aside, it's a great product, and for the price, you can't find a better deal on Amazon.  As far as toast is concerned, at least.
