Works great on my glasses
I bought these to help me keep the lenses on my glasses clean.  I was using a special cloth that I bought from my optometrist with a spray, and it always made my lenses smudge.  These cloths don't smudge at all, and my vision is crystal clear after.  Even better, you can keep a few with you at all times in case of any unforeseen "emergencies."  This may not be the most economical way to clean your glasses, but you can't put a price on being able to see, either.
