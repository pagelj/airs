I had doubts after reading the mixed reviews; however, this little charmer is perfect!! A little rattling at first until I pressed in the casing and voila!  Perfectly silent and cute to boot. You can't go wrong with this microwave! Heats well, and can fit full sized caserole dish inside with the glass turntable.
