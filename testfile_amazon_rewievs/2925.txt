What a Buy!!!
Not much to say beyond noting I bought this on sale and have received a ton of pleasure from it in a short time. While it can't measure up to my blue-ray setup, this mighty-mite is delivering excellent fidelity to the old red-rays of yesteryear. I am positive it will still be working when the next color ray is found and promoted!
