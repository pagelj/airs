Plenty more tape than you'll probably ever need.
I know this tape says 3M on it, but it doesn't quite seem to live up to their name. The aftermarket company who cuts these down to size does a fantastic job of butchering the quality. Fortunately, if you're just replacing a phone screen or two, you should have plenty of extra tape to pick and choose the bits you want to cut out & use or toss.  The tape itself is relatively tacky. I sincerely hope it is strong enough to keep the digitizer in place on my phone, but I'm very doubtful that this will hold up very long, or to any amount of abuse.
