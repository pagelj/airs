Giraffe bag
Ok, this is a lovely bag, really lovely handles that carry well, roomy, has a couple of ways of being worn by using the clip together closers.  As good as it looks.  However, and I'm not happy about this is the lining of the outside pocket was torn.  Not visible to the eye but when you put things in the pocket they tend to disappear.  Buying it in Australia, I decided not to send back to USA.  Otherwise as described.
