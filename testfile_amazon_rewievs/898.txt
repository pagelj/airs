charging cable doesn't fit in the round holes
I have another case that has square holes near the charging port, and the cable fits in it, but in the cases with a round hole, the chargers wont fit.  This case also doesn't have the protection at the top part of the phone like my other case has. The kickstand is very good, and the case overall is good for the price.
