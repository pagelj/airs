Awesome Camera!!!
Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (BlUE) (2012 Model)Pro's:1. Great Camera... Love the zoom, it's awesome and it works...2. I referred 2 friends to this camera after my purchase of this camera and all of us think the same for the use, picture quality as well as the HD video for this camera.3. I purchased the Blue one and the color is an awesome Blue / both my friends love the Black color they purchased.4. The zoom is great, you have to be steady and it takes great pictures when zoomed out.5. The Macro - O Man this is great from our last Sony as you can use the Macro without selecting the Macro button, its "Auto Macro" so you subject don't get away faster than you can select the Macro button and make sure your on Macro! Love it! Sony makes an awesome camera both for functionality, looks, design and sleekness.6. From my previous camera and yes all three of us had the previous Sony and it don't compare to the Video in this new camera  - this one has great picture quality for the movies.7. Seller shipped as promised and SUPER shipping rate! Received package intact as described by seller with no missing parts... Con's:1. I was a bit taken back as to the quality of this camera. I'm used to Sony having a wee bit more weight for their product. This one appears to be of another metal or plastic where-as all my other Sony Cameras were of real quality metal and it showed it! I guess it's expected when things are moving at the speed they are today and the rate of planned obsolescence of a product being less than a year it's a wonder they're not made of paper for automatic degradation! All in All -  Pleased with out purchase
