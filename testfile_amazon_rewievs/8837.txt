Works great for a my kids quick hot sandwich!!!
I have this item and it works great for what's it's intended for. It makes fast grill cheese sandwiches for my kids and so far it's easy to clean. Nothing sticks to it yet but if you want a spray of PAM will work. I use just basic white sandwich bread and they fit fine. I would recommend this for a simple fast sandwich. Give a try.. P. S. Why I didn't give it 5 stars because I would like to be able to remove the plates for easy cleaning.
