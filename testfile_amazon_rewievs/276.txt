A WHOLE NEW WORLD
AVATAR is unlike any film I've ever seen.  The envisioning of Pandora itself is mind-boggling; the performance capture effects unlike anything previously seen; while the script is nothing overly outstanding, the movie's epic scale and sheer entertainment value is what movie-making should be and ultimately should have won Oscars for both Cameron and the Best Picture.  It's an amazing feat.
