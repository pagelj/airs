Bought this toaster since it was the one recommended by Consumers Report.  Very good choice for a basic 2-slice toaster.  And a great price. It toasts bread, bagels, English muffins, frozen waffles and the like, perfectly, which is all we needed.  We looked at other models with more features, but this one is the deal for a simple toaster that makes great toast.  Used it for a month now with no problems.
