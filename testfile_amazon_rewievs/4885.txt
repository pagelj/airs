Amazing!!! camera
I bought this camera for a trip to Florida and I was amazed with clear photos and the video quality. The zoom is huge!! and the photos were excelent at full zoom and without a tripod. Viewfinder is excellent for sunny days. The flash is not automatic as I expected but it was not a problem. Conclusion:Amazing!! camera
