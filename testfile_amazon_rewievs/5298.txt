Sturdy little addition to any space where a covered trashcan is required. Why wouldn't it last a life time?  The inner lining is an added benefit, cleverly disguising whatever plastic bag recycling you might want to incorporate instead of the simplehuman liners (of which three are included so you can try them out). Pros:  *fits small spaces  -- but holds quite a bit!  *smoothly operating step on pedal raises lid for hands free disposal  *clean enamel finish  *may use recyclable plastic bags as linersCons: *none, really.  It is very small - just be sure to measure the space for which you intend it.
