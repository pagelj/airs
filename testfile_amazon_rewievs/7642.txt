It covers my Wife's pad.
This covers my Wife's pad computer but the keybord is useless.  I could not plug it into the pad and could not get it to work on the home computer either.  The case is nice and the stand is a plus.  For the money it is good.  Would rather have a pocket for a notepad and an ink pen holder than a keyboard that does not work.
