I have bought alot of phones !
This is the best hands down !! The one thing for me that is a worth its weight in gold is the phone blocker !!!!!! I still get many telemarketing calls and I can block them so every time they call it rings once then their blocked !! Sound is great and can get real loud . I put it on the lowest sound . Great phone . Even the one of the ring tones my kids like to dance to it every time it rings lol.
