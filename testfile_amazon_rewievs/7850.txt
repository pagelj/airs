I have 4 of these in my house
I'm an IT professional, and these were a little confusing to get working at first. You'll need to create an account at a site like dyndns. org to be able to access these away from home (assuming you don't have static IPs). You create a hostname like amazonuser. homeip. net and tell each camera to point to that and to a specific port number. Each cam can point to the same hostname but must use a different port. Four cams would use, for example, port 80, 81, 82, and 83. I look at the cams with a free android app called tinyCam Monitor. With that, I can see all 4 cam views simultaneously on my cell phone screen. You double-click on a view to see that one full screen, and you can control the cam movement with touch or physical controls on your phone. I've been using 3G, and the video feed/controls sometimes crap out a little bit (black screen or unresponsive controls), but 4G works a lot better from what I've seen. These things have great night vision too. I'd buy more if I had a bigger house.
