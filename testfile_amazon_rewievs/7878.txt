Great Stand
the mStand is a perfect stand to give my 2010 macbook pro a life as both a desktop and a laptop.  It is the perfect size and shape.  I hooked up a wireless mouse and keyboard and away I go.  The price on Amazon made my wife think that it was going to be a cheap plastic job, but when she saw it, she said that it looked sharp and was great.  I agree.
