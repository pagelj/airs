The Panasonic NN-SD372S is the perfect fit for our breakroom. We purchased three of them and they get a good workout 5 days a week for breakfast and lunch meals. The 950-Watt/10.2 Amp Microwaves are powerful enough to cook our employees meals fast. The interior is large enough to hold a dinner plate and exterior is easy to clean and has a small footprint. The controls are easy to understand and operate for basic cooking/reheating of meals.
