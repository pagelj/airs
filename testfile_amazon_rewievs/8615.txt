So handy
I bought this for my emergency kit in case I needed a fire.  I personally haven't opened my package yet cause I want to keep it as dry as possible in my kit until I need it.  However, my neighbor who recommended it used it on front of me and let me tell you, it started the camp fire just right.  It was great to see how well it worked.  I do recommend this for your kit.
