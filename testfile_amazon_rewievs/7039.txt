Great invention. Darn near perfect
I thought there were magnets to hold the blade but it uses rubber pads. I HATE going to cook at friends or family only to find they have worthless knives so I bring my favorite with. Until now I used tape or cardboard for transport. This thing is 22nd century cardboard! Bumping off a star because loading is a little tricky when knife is at the max size (8" knife in 8" holder): it won't close unless you put in the "correct" side first and using all folding plastic for the hinges and latches means they will fail 10x as fast as if they used an actual hinge or clasp. It's literally 10Â¢ of plastic with 5000% markup due to the I. P.  nice deign but could be sold at $3 for a profit.-awr
