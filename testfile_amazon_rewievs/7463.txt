Great lighting for what it is.
I was looking for something that was small and portable but would give me a bit softer light that the sto fen diffuser on my 580ex II.  I've been very happy with the results this gives and for the price you can't go wrong.  The little rubber band broke after about 6 months of use, but I just found an o-ring at OSH and it works just as well.  It looks cheap, feels cheap, and is cheap, but the results are great.
