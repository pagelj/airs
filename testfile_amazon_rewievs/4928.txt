Fantastic
An amazing novel for both our current generation and those to come. For the Generation Xers who have children and for those children (like mine) who have never known a time when we didn't have computers and the Internet. It is one of those books you never forget. I will carry it with me in that virtual inventory like the egg that it is. Cudos to Ernie. Great job.
