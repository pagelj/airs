If you like Christine feehan you will like this series.
I have read all of the Christine Feehan "Dark" Carpathian books and this is much like them but much steamier! As with Ms Feehan the mates Share a soul and the male vampire is left without much emotion and no sex after a certain age and will not get them back until he joins with his mate. This is a nice quick read and if at all possible have your significant other close at hand, I guarantee they will appreciate the attention they receive once you put the book down :)
