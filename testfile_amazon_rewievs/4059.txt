A bit trite, but a pleasant read.
The plot lines re-cover a lot of very well-trod ground; to the extent that at one point, I started wondering if I had read it previously. That said, it was still enjoyable -- owing to the likable and adequately-developed characters. So although it's no instant classic, as entertainment it's worth the reasonable price. I've definitely paid more and gotten less elsewhere!
