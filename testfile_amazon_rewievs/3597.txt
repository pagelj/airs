Fits my DSC-HX5V Just Dandy.
I was worried that this case would be too small by my Sony DSC-HX5V but it fits perfectly.  The fit is tight but not overly so.  The case is small but protects the camera well from bumps and drops.  Better than sticking it in your pocket and just as accessible. Sony LCS-CST General Purpose Soft Carrying Case for Slim Cybershot Digital Cameras
