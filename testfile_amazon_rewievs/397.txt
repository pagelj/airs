Works great on Macbook Pro
I had a problem with my Macbook pro, which didn't read DVDs, only audio CDs.  I used this DVD cleaner and now it works fine!  I played the intro track and about 2 minutes of the cleaning track, then the 3rd and part of the 4th track just in case.  I skipped the rest of the cd. EDITI had problems again with my cd drive a few days later, and took apart my Macbook pro and cd drive to see what the problem was.  It turns out a piece of plastic was stuck in the cd drive and that was the main cause of the drive's inability to read cds.  Therefore, I can't say that this cleaning disc solved all my problems since a dirty lens wasn't the main cause, but it seems to work for dirty lenses in any case.
