Worked for less than 2 weeks
For starters, it took a LONG time to arrive.  The length was exactly what I needed and it was an iphone 5 charger as promised.  What I was not impressed with, however, is that the cord only worked for less than 2 weeks after I received it---VERY disappointing. So now I am back to square one--I need ANOTHER long cord.
