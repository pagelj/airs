Can't record while charging!
I bought this one base on the good reviews and I think I got the defective unit. While recording, I plugged the car charger in and it stopped to give me the two choices, "mass storage" and "PC camera". Come on, I am on the road and the cord is the  car charger not USB cable. I don't know how long the Lithium battery will last (and I am not going to find out because it needs to go back) but for the 5 hours trip, I want it recording while charging.
