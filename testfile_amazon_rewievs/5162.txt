Bought this for my car.  Its so much easier to use then our big upright vacuum.  Plus its suction is really strong, its easy to hold and carry, its great for tight places.  Clean up is easy and its convenient that you can clean the filter and reuse it. The power cord wraps around the base easily and the extra attachment can be stored in the vacuum as well. Im keeping this based on its quality, power, ease of use, compact design, reusable filter, and price.  I definitely recommend this to others looking for something small yet strong to do a quick clean up of spills and daily debris in the car and at home.
