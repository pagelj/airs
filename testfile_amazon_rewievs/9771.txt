peciliar? slightly. good? no.
While this book may have an intriguing hook and interesting premise, the writing style doesn't match the subject matter and the promised peculiarities do not pan out. The book lacks beauty and imagery; it is evident at least to me that the author is not in love with language. The promised peculiarity is weak at best.  In short, the Harry Potter series offers more charm, and the television series Fringe offers more weirdness. I am sorry I bought it.
