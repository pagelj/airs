I bought this Brew Station at Target on sale for $49 about one month ago.  When I got home I read the reviews on here and thought, "oh no".  But I gave it a chance.  First of all, the complaints about lukewarm coffee don't apply to my machine as it will scald your taste buds off if you don't let it cool (which I like).  And yes, cleanup is a bit messy but I can even deal with that.  The coffee tastes good and doesn't get bitter.  So why three stars instead of five you may ask?  The SPOUT.  Whoever designed the spout needs to be flogged.  They put the darn thing about .000000000000001 of a millimeter from the base and on weekdays when I attempt to fill my travel mug I am so happy when I only have coffee running down the mug and not all over the counter and on my pants.  If I hunch over and perform what appears to be brain surgery I can almost pour a cup without spilling any at all... almost.  I mean, why wouldn't the spout be out over the center of your cup?  It will remain one of life's great mysteries to me I guess.  Overall, I love it except for that dang spout... I'll buy a Bunn when this one goes out.
