Not exactly what they promised
The handbag is quite what you see in the picture, i liked it very much but in the descrption of the product said it came with a badge with the "mount arizzo" signature as a prove of its authenticity.... Welll, the badge was nowhere to be seen, what makes me feel like its not what they say it was.
