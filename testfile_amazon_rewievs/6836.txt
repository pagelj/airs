Small, single lens holster
This holster is nice for people who only need to carry around a DSLR with a single lens. There is not much space to hold anything else inside the main compartment, and the side pockets can be used to carry filters or something similarly sized. I bought this to bring along with me on hiking trips, but I found that attaching the camera to my backpack with a zip tie works just a well and doesn't require me to carry another bag around. I ended up not using this bag much at all.
