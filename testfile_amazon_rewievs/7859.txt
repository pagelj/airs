i liked it because it has to be the best i've heard from them
this my chemical romance cd is the most  rocking one i own , i like my chemical romance and listening to this cd  it isn't depressing as the other ones this one rocks and i find myself singing along with and head bobbing  and just plain loving it they rock!
