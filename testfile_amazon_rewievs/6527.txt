Can't believe how amazing this book was!!
I just finished reading the Wool collection 1-5. I am stunned and amazed at how great of a read this was! How in the world was such a read so inexpensive?? This is a great read about humanity's drive to expand, to create, to love - and for some to rule and manipulate. This starts out telling individual's stories from their view point living inside the silo. As the story progresses, the viewpoints start to shift more and more, broadening out giving you more of the big picture with each piece. I can't tell you how many I times I exclaimed, "what the heck?!!" and not believing what I just read. So many twists and turns, most of which I didn't see coming. The author did an amazing job. I'd really like to find more to this story! I'm glad my sister showed this book to me - I'm definitely spreading the word!
