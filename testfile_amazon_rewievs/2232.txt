Great SciFi
Been a SciFi and Fantasy novel reader for 35 years and I loved this book. It's not often that I get nervous for characters when reading a novel but I did with this one.  Several times I had to put it down and go for a walk before I could read it again - I was starting to speed read to find out what happened next.
