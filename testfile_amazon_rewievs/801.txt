Great portable power supply
Works great with HTC Evo 3D and iPod touch.  Really like that the power supply shuts itself off once the connected device has reached full charge.  Portable supply came nearly 100% charged and ready to use.  Carry bag included with the power supply is nice.  Only improvement I'd suggest is that it would be nice for the storage/carry bag to have a separate "pocket" to put the cord and various connector ends versus storying the power supply and all accessories in the same compartment.  Overall, would definitely recommend this product and am considering getting more as gifts for others.
