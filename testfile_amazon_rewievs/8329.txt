Perfect Camera Bag
For this price, the bag is outstanding. It can comfortably hold a camera and 4-5 lenses, depending on their size. I usually transport all my equipment in Pelican cases, but in situations where I need to be quick, or have to travel on a plane I just put everything in this bag. After 12 months of use, it is still fully functional and looks great.
