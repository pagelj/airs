Professional Sound from a small package
After a few unsuccessful attempts to get clean audio from my DSLR I decided to find a compact alternative that would give me high quality digital recording without breaking the bank.  I use a wireless lavaliere mic and a room mic for my interviews and being able to connect directly to the Zoom via XLR and adjust each channel individualy (which was added with the recent firmware update 1.72) is a godsend. I purchased a 8GB SD card which gives me over 11 hours of record time at 16bit 48kHz stereo. I remember the days of having to record on DAT which wasn't cheap and definately could not be stored in your pocket. The cons are cosmetic but not game changing.  The jog wheel is small as well as the tiny menu button.  It would have been nice to get a Camera Shoe included.  All in all I highly recommend for the DSLR/Video Shooter on the go.
