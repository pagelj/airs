love it -- for office use
an office of 50+ people + picky requirements for design = it has been hard for us to get a good toaster. This toaster is awesome. Everyone understands how to use it/it's very intuitive, it doesn't heat up slowly as our last one did, it has a nice variety of settings, and it is stainless steel which the designers love. UPDATE: we've used the heck out of this toaster for 2 years & it is still great. I highly recommend it.
