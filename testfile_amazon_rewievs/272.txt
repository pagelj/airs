It's like a Sesame Street Iphone. Perfect!
My son received this for his 2nd birthday. While it does not solve the problem of him always wanting to play with my actual Iphone, he does still play with it, or anything else that resembles a phone. He is, like many other toddlers, Elmo-obsessed, so he presses the button to make Elmo talk over and over and over again. If you have an Iphone, this toy has a very similar design; bottom center button, with all of your "Apps" on the screen that have Sesame street characters in place. There is a musical mode that the toy just plays songs when you hit the buttons, or an actual play option where you can call whichever character whose face you touch and they will say something silly to your child. The phone lights up wherever your finger touches, plays adorable little songs and sounds, and has been dropped, kicked, thrown, all of the above in my house and still looks and acts perfect, so A+ for durability! This toy is not loud and obnoxious at all, and my son really does use it like a phone. I would recommend it over several of the other toy phones I have tried, or infact, any other toy phone I have seen!
