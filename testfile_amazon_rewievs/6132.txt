Sturdy, Professional and Easy to Install
This monitor stand is heavy duty and it looks to me that it can handle more than just 24". I installed it in my office and everyone likes it. I use it with two Viewsonic VX2450wm-LED for 4-5 months now with no issues. It has cable management and it does everything advertised. All tools are included and it's very easy to install. You can do it with 1 person, but I had help so I was able to get it done in 15-20 minutes. I'm loving it and will likely to buy 3 more of these.
