This Eureka 2-in-1 battery-powered vacuum is not very powerful, and the bagless dust cup design is poor, and it's not easy to use in the handheld mode, but it's so light that this is the first vacuum that I want to use every day! Make that twice a day! Or even thrice when I'm in a good mood! I cannot give it 5 stars due to the aforementioned problems, and the fact the battery doesn't last a long time per charge and the battery charger is poorly constructed. But overall, I can recommend it to anyone living in a dusty city like myself. (My city has a clean air rating per some govt ratings but it's dusty, dusty, dusty all the time!) I can pick it up easily and do a quick round without breaking my back or strain my shoulders. I hate my 30-pound Dyson, to be honest! I dread using that big monster, even though its suction power is probably 20 times this little thing's. I just ordered 2 more Eureka's from Amazon, one for each room!
