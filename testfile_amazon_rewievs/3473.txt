well written
Dorian Kelly  has done a great job in developing the characters and the story-line. You find yourself rooting for Michael and hoping that the town finally sees the truth. You also cheer as Kylie manages to overcome her past and come into her own. I can't wait to read the next two Ballymuir books in the series.
