Outstanding lens!!  A good reason why I chose it over the 17-55
You've read the reviews as I did.  Simply put, it's an outstanding general purpose lens.  It's sharper than my old 18-105, 10-24, and a close match for the images I get with my 70-300mm.  Mind you, it's not quite as clear and contrasty as my 35 1.8 or 50mm 1.8G, but close.  So if you're critical of sharpness in images taken with your other kit lenses and they're not cutting it, then this is the lens for you. I could've returned this lens, sold my 10-24mm, and then grabbed the 17-55 2.8, which is a lens I've been wanting for some time.  I choose to keep my 16-85 and 10-24 simply because that combination gives me more possibilities than the 17-55.  Please note I'm not comparing the 17-55 & 16-85, but only pointing out what the 16-85 with VRII can achieve which the 17-55 can't and my reason for keeping the 16-85. What the 17-55 2.8 can't do well:  The other day I was shooting late afternoon with a storm approaching.  I needed good depth of field shooting handheld from the car with window rolled down.  The sun was blocked by stormy skies and being later in the afternoon the lighting wasn't optimal.  I shot the landscape at f/8 with shutter speeds from 1/4 - 1/13 sec.  VRII saved the shot.  Some tree branches/leaves were blurred due to wind and slow shutter.  However, the subject in my shot was crystal clear!  The 17-55 couldn't make that shot unless it was on a tripod.  No if, ands, or buts!  At least I couldn't make that shot without a car window pod! I feel that I'd miss shots with the pro 17-55 that I'd otherwise achieve with the 16-85.  If I were shooting portraits or close subjects where shallow depth of field is desired, then I'd absolutely prefer the 17-55.  There aren't many times I need that capability.  However, if I do need a fast lens, I'd reach for my 35 1.8 or 50mm. I hear many people say this "VR does not compensate for fast glass."  It all depends on what you're shooting, whether it's moving, available light, if you need depth of field, etc.  VRII is the saving grace on the 16-85, particularly if you need broad depth and shoot at smaller apertures.  "Fast glass" doesn't help you in a lower light/broad depth situations, such as a landscape or general scenery.  If you want to shoot Mount Rainier hand held at f2.8 later in the evening, then fine.  I wouldn't do that... I'd set a smaller aperture such as f5.6 or maybe f8-f16 depending on the lens.  The 17-55 wouldn't work out so well in that situation, trying to hand hold f8 under 1/30 sec. Final thoughts:  The 16-85 is very noticeably sharper than my 18-105 and every other kit lens I've used,  It's better built, and generally a higher quality lens all around.  It's sharper and generally more clear and contrasty than my Nikon 10-24mm and I often question the need to go wider than 16mm for a landscape shot.  I'd vote that it's the best 'plastic' DX zoom Nikon has made.  It obviously sits below the pro 17-55 in the Nikon DX lineup, though you can achieve shots with it that the 17-55 can't help you with.  Now, give me a 17-55 2.8 with VRII and I'll shoot hand held evening pics at f/8 and smaller with no worries. I hope this review can help make up your mind what to get.
