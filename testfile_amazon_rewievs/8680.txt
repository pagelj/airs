Super Toaster!
I gave this to my Dad for Christmas, and it was so great I bought one for myself!  We tried soft-boiled eggs and a "poached" egg, and both cooked perfectly.  The toaster toasts very evenly.  Two comments I'd like to add are:1.  The "poached" egg is not actually sitting in water like a real poached egg, so it's actually better.2.  If you cook your egg in the shell, you cannot use the meat tray at the same time.  That was a disappointment. And a small piece of advice: run the toaster without bread a couple of times when you first get it, or your first toast will taste like new appliance.
