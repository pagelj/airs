Fixed my PS3 problem
I had other "High speed cables" but my ps3 was having problems with 1080p and 3d content, screen would go black and content would blink, snow screen ... many problemsamazon cables arrived and problem solved looks so much clear now so crisp and no more problems at all ...1080p looks like it should without issues and i even saw an increase in the audio quality of my Surround sound system
