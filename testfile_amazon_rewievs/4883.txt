Battery is worthless
This battery did not hold a charge very long. I should have read the other reviews before ordering. It varied in the length of time that it would hold a charge immediately proceeding a "full charge" between 2hours and 11/2 hours and continually decreased rapidly. The battery was worthless as far as I'm concerned
