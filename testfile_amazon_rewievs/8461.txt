Great point and shoot to use in place of a DSLR
I got this camera after my Sony Alpha a290 was stolen to not necessarily replace it, but to have until I can afford a new one. The camera is a bit bulky, but that is the only con I have. It is great for being on the go because it is still much smaller than a DSLR, and can take beautiful pictures. I mostly use the Macro setting for nature photography, so that was a main reason I chose this camera, and it does not disappoint. It is also great in low-light at night. GREAT BUY! And an excellent, affordable camera for a learning or amateur photographer, with it's easy controls and great quality.
