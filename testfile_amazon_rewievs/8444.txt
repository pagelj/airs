If you are thinking about buying this coffee maker, STOP!  Like many other reviewers, I did not read the negative reviews before purchasing this item.  It comes out of the box with a noxious odor that you cannot get rid of.  I put water/white vinegar and then pot after pot of plain water through it.  I then made coffee and tried it out.  I tried one cup.  The chemical taste and smell were so bad that it literally made me sick. This product should be pulled off the market.  I'm convinced it is a hazard to people's health. I think what probably happened is this: the model got a good review in Consumer Reports.  The manufacturer then had to kick up production, something changed and they started using some other material to make the product.  You know it's not made in the USA, so who knows what kind of chemicals they are using to produce the plastic in the product.  Buyer beware! I returned this one and went with Hamilton Beach Two Way Brewer Single Serve and 12-cup Coffee Maker.  All is well.
