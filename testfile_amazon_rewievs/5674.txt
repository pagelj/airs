Slow Ride
I'm not sure why there needed to be an epilogue to the epilogue. This is just more of Keely and Jacks crazy relationship. I have to say it would be exhausting being around these two. There is drama over everything. My issue is why would we want to read the wedding scene and all of the fighting over Jack maki Keely wait for 14 hours until they got to a bed. Then listen to Keely whine the entire time to get to their destination and have the author glass over the sex?? It's a good thing this was free. I would of boycotted the rest of the series if I had bought this.
