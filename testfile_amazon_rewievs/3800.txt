Decent, but not exactly what I expected.
These cutting boards arrived VERY quickly. They were much skinnier than I thought they would be, but that might have been from looking at the dimensions incorrectly. I hand wash the cutting boards and every time it seems like particles of food want to stay on the board--even with hot water and soap.  I wouldn't order these again, but they'll do for now!
