Works great!
Took it to Hawaii right after we got it and it worked perfectly. Took it on the boat, snorkeling, swimming, and pretty much everywhere else. Didn't have any issues with it at all so far but one thing I would like to see is a stronger string that holds on to the camera. Its sort of the same type of thing that the camera comes with and it seems like since its a sport strap, it would be more robust. Otherwise, works great. Floated my Nikon AW100 with ease.
