Piece of Junk!
I've had this stand for over three years and I can't believe I haven't thrown this POS out! IT DOESN'T HOLD A LAPTOP! I've had ten different people try to tighten the knobs so the laptop doesn't fall and it does EVERY TIME! I have to HOLD IT to keep my mac laptop from falling on my $1600 Serato mixer. Send this POS back if you're having problems with it. It won't "resolve" over time.
