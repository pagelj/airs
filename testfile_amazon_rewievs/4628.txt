I am so glad I bought the Hoover WindTunnel vacuum.  I had no idea my carpet was so dusty.  I had just finished vacuuming with my old vacuum when my Hoover arrived.  After putting my new vacuum together (which was really easy), I decided to vacuum again.  It was amazing at how much was left in my carpet.  The dust that was trapped in the bagless-container was more than I imagined.  The suction was immense.  It literally picked the carpet up off of the floor.  The only thing I don't like about it already is that if you vacuum up very much and the bagless-container fills up, then it gets caught between the cone in the center of the bagless-container.  You have to reach up inside the bagless-container to loosen it in order to empty it.  Other than that, that's the only complaint I have.  But, if you are like me, I usually empty the bagless-container after every time anyway.  I normally don't like to vacuum, but this actually makes it fun.  Hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.
