Cuisinart Toaster/Convection Oven Not As Advertised
We already had this oven in white enamel, 4-5 years old, so I ordered the wife one this Christmas to go with the stainless steel appliances in our newly renovated kitchen.  I was tremendously disappointed when she opened it on Christmas morning to find that the only stainless steel on the entire oven was a 1-inch cowling around the door, and a small brand logo on the door itself.  The remainder of the oven, front control panel, sides, back, top, was enameled steel.  I am sending this item back to Amazon as soon as I get permission, and searching for another brand that is truthful as to its construction.
