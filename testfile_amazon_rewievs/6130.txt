Tepid tripe for the masses
I enjoy romance, and it's usually predictable. But the main character is all over the place. She loves her job, she screws around on wedding stuff at work.  She loves the guy, but doesn't seem to want to spend time with him. I couldn't keep track of her motives, and that's a deal-breaker to me.
