Great little memory card!
I bought this card to use with my new Droid Razr M phone since it was capable of handling up to 32GB of external storage.  It still amazes me 32GB will fit into this small space!  The only thing that surprised me was the phone only recognized 29.71GB of storage space after it was installed.  However, this does seem to be the case with all storage cards.  It  performs flawlessly though. I would recommend this SanDisk micro SD card to anyone that would like to increase their storage space.
