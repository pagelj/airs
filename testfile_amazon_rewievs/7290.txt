A pretty good deal for the money
I've bought some of the cheap sharpeners and they barely work. This one gave a chef knife I have that's always been stubborn a pretty decent edge. The other chef knives sharpened well but not razor sharp and better than using the cheap crap you see for $10. Follow the instructions and for dull knives run through the procedure twice and you'll have very usable knives.
