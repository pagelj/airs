A good deal when it's on sale
The material is tough enough, the rain cover is useful when it's raining, and most of the pockets are large enough to hold things you need to get at in a hurry. However, the "sleeping bag" compartment at the bottom of the pack is only large enough to hold a child's sized sleep bag. Even with a decent compression sack I was not able to stuff my sleeping bag in there. Luckily, the thing comes with plenty of external straps, but in future versions of this bag, Teton would be wise to make that sleep bag compartment just a bit bigger. Overall, a good value if you can get it below $60.
