Super cheap and they work for me
I ordered the 5 pack in August 2010 and just applied the 4th one on my iPod Touch. I find them easy to apply and they do a great job of protecting my device. The reason I just replaced the screen protector was I dropped the iPod Touch on a concrete surface with small stones that damaged the protector but didn't get through to the glass of the device. I didn't notice but the old protector, which had been on for many months, was a bit dull from so much use. When I put the new one on it looks so clean and bright. For the price I don't know how they can produce this product and ship it for free. I see no reason to spend as much as $15 (try Best Buy's exclusive brand for example) when I can get five of these for under $2. I just ordered another 5 pack.
