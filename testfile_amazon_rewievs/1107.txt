Satisfaction
I finally got something through the mail thats worth the money for a change. I rate this product a low 5, strong 4.5. I would have loved to have had the owners manual shipped w/it also. I did go online to download the manual, but thats was a waste of time. Instead of the manual, the site kept trying to sell me stuff I didn't want or need, and it wanted me to download a new toolbar. Anyway I just read the manual online w/out downloading anything, for this tab. it started on page 16. Anyhow, me and the kids are enjoying this, and being that this is my first one, I will be getting another one thanks to the price. I do recommend this tab for the skeptics like myself if you're cautious about spending your hard earned dough. This one is worth the effort, if its your first one, or a kool gift for someone.
