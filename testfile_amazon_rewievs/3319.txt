Not what it appears to be
I was very excited about getting this product but very dissappointed when I received it. This is nothing more than 50 feet of camo colored shoe laces. I was looking for something a bit sturdier. Probably my fault for not researching it more and expecting something more than the price said I was getting. If it's what you need then great but be aware that I have boot shoe laces that look sturdier than this stuff.
