Best 50mm I own
I picked this lens up on sale a few months ago and I'm glad I did. It's build quality is a thousand times better than the super cheap 1.8 Canon makes and for most photographers this lens will surpass your expectations. I actually find it's sharper than the 1.2 and for the price you can't really go wrong. One thing I love about shooting with prime lenses is that it makes you more creative, you'll find yourself moving around more to achieve the composition you want, instead of being lazy like you would with a zoom lens and simply zooming in to get your frame. This lens is great for portraits, low light scenarios and on a full frame camera this focal range makes for a great everyday lens too!
