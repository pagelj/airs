Portable USB Blu Ray player
The Blu Ray cannot be used with my Toshiba Satellite XP OS.  Apparently this Toshiba Satellite (a few years old from Costco) does not have the necessary firmware for any blu ray.  When I tried to return the product for a full refund, the seller (VRGamerz - Amazon Marketplac'e) does not give a full refund.  It has a 15% restocking policy, plus I have to pay for the return postage.  I feel the price of the refund is not worth my returning the item.  Lesson learned here:  Never to buy from this seller, VRGamerz - Amazon Marketplac'e, even via Amazon.  Amazon gives a full refund plus pay for return postage.
