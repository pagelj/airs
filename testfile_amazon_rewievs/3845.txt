Very good HU at lower pirce point.
I bought this to replace the stock cassette radio that came with my 2000 Ford F-150.  I knew that a double din unit was oversized for my app, but I did some cutting inside dash with dremmel and mini hack saw and got it to fit.  Soldered new connector(amazon also) wires to hu leads and plugged into truck harness and fired it up.  As others have reviewed, the graphics are lame (no screensaver option) but the functionality of unit is good.  I use the bluetooth for hands-free cellphone and I'm very happy with it.  Music sounds better than stock unit to me.  For me, it has plenty of power with EQ pre-sets of classic, pop, rock or off, plus loudness and dbs boost buttons (which I use). I'm able to taylor EQ of various music genres to my liking.  Touch screen works well but I find myself using volume buttons to control unit rather than with touchscreen. Need to switch screen menu to make EQ adjustments.  I've added a Pyle back-up camera at install which I recommend for those that trailer stuff. CD player and SD reader work good (again graphics kinda lame).  I have not watched any videos yet.  I was looking for an inexpensive hu that did it all with bluetooth, back-up camera compat. SD/USB/CD/DVD to replace my stock unit.  I found it with this Boss BC9560B hu and would highly recommend this unit at a price point of $200-$250.
