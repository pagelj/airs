Finally a great set of knives
Love, Love, Love, Love these knives!!! I've had several knife sets over my life and all were just ok. Some were semi-expensive (at least to my budget) and some where cheap but all were about the same quality. I got the Ginsu in a lightening deal and I will never buy another brand again. These knives ROCK! I've seen the silly commercials on TV for the Ginsu where they cut through really tough things then turn around and it still slices perfectly through a tomato. No, I haven't tried the aluminum cans like they used on TV. However, everything I have sliced, diced or chopped has been wonderful. This may be a coincidence but I've also have had a lot less problems with onions. Not sure why but they burn my eyes a lot less when I chop them with these knives. Maybe because the knives are so sharp I can get the onions cut up before my eyes get irritated.... hmmm???
