Great Item
Received the item today Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) . Looks great. Small scratch on corner but for a used item it is in great shape. Only downside was that I signed up for text trac which was suppose to send me a text when the item was out for delivery and I did not receive. I am glad the post man thought enough to put it inside the screen door and not leave it out in the open. Maybe it does not work for all forms of shipping. Overall, very happy with the tablet.
