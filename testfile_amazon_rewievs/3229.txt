Canon EOS 60D  camera
Went back and forth and back and forth between the 7D and the 60D . I was able to make my choice not by how much they cost but by my shooting style . I do shoot my grand kids sports and daily lives as well as a lot of travel and landscape photos. Now I can't say what shooting a 7D is like but I absolutely LOVE my 60D and have not regretted my choice at all . I moved from the 40D and I must say I like the layout of the 60D much better . It is a fun camera to shoot and the video is very impressive. I have had many camera's in my over 30 yrs of photography and this one is a keeper .
