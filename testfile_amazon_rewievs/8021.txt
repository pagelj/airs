Cool-looking & Lightweight, But Strappy
Bought this as a back-to-school pack for my elementary school-age son (7).  Love the look! Durable! Lightweight! BUT: he hates the side straps and too-long shoulder straps. I can't blame him: the side straps have to be unclipped to fully access the inside of the pack for small hands to be able to reach down inside for little-kid stuff. The shoulder strap overhang pulls catch on everything in sight. Great for a taller, bigger person, I'm thinking; irritating on a small person.
