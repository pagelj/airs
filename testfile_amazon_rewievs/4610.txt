Great product!
My husband had a similar toaster (by Paula Dean) for a number of years and it finally needed to be replaced, so I found this one online.  He was very happy we had another Egg and Muffin toaster. We love eating Egg Muffins, in fact, we had one this morning. YUM! As inspiration from the Paula Dean signature on our previous model, I also took a paint pen and wrote our names in a heart on the open space on the front side of our toaster, giving it a special personal loving touch.
