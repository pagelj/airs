This vacuum cleaner is not a good buy and I will not recommend it to anyone! It is heavy and not easy at all to move around... worst of all it seems to be blowing the dust around instead of actually vacuuming the floor. It is also difficult to use  under sofas, beds etc. We have to vacuum the floors three times before all the dust is gone... as it just moves it from room to room! Would love to return and buy something else!
