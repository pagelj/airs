Wanted Apple batteries & didn't want the Mac Tax... PERFECT!!!
I wanted to get some Apple batteries that they sell 6 for $30 but my logical side realize that I probably could find something similar cheaper. So I did some Google searching and found somebody who compared these Eneloops to the Apple batteries and they are identical. So basically you save between 25 and 30% instead of buying the Apple branded batteries. The one thing that I do appreciate also which you cannot do with the Apple batteries is by 4 packs or 8 packs.  I will clarify I ment but the 4pack AA with Charger & 4 pack AA = $30... but 6pack AA & charger $30 which is the same as apples. Buy the 2AA a the charger and then a 4 pack AA of Eneloops & save $7.00 on Apples price! http://www. amazon. com/gp/product/B000IV0RD6/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnkOne thing I will say is that the Apple charger is way more styling than the Sanyo but really I'm not that vain. When you by Eneloops you are getting the best rechargeable batteries on the market they just last forever and you can recharge them and are good for the earth so it's a win-win-win all the way around. I will never buy another disposable battery again. NOTE: THE SANYO CHARGER CHARGES AAA BATTERIES TOO!!!  So I fell it beats Apples charge it that respect too.  So Apples unit is not better even though it looks nicer. One thing I've come to consider is that since the Apple charger is so much nicer you might want to drop the $30 and buy that one (yes for that price you will get to less AA batteries) but the charger is so much nicer in my opinion. But then thereafter by all the other batteries you need here as they are the same quality (and as some reviewers have pointed out even better quality)Thanks for reading
