Don't Get Ripped off Buying Cables at Retail Stores
At under 8.00, these cables offered by Amazon  will work exactly like the Monster 100.00 cable.  I'm not sure where people are saying that 1.4 is needed for 3d.  The 1.3 cables at 10.2 GBPS work as well as the 1.4 at 15.2 GBPS.  There is no commercial media I know of that requires 15.2 at this time. However, if you need HDMI cables, just buy these at this low price and you will get everything you need.  If you want to see an excellent primer, go to mycablemart. com.  Their cables are very high quality and "pretty".  Their prices are good but they nail you on shipping.  They are an Amazon associated company. The Amazon new optical cables are also very good.  If you can't use your HDMI for sound, this is a good second best way to hear great sound.  Spend 25.00 bucks and get free shipping. Jerry
