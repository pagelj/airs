Perfect the first time you use it Only
Ultrabooks dont take dvds to safe space. but dont buy this laptop , it is probably cheap but it seems good qulity but really isnt.  The fan sounds sometimes like some stone is stuck inside. The computer crashes constantly. Is extremely slow when openning programs. Windows 8 isnt the big deal. I bpught it and the first couple days perfect but then i started discovering all the problems and i returned it. It comes without office so youll have to buy it as well as antivirus.  Then i bought a mac mini for almost same price , 100 more and is just apple, no complaints
