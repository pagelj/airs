I LOVE this bag!
I LOVE this bag, and even though it only lasted about year, I'm ordering another one. It has lots of pockets for organizing, a built in wallet, and an adjustable strap. It is a good size: not too big and not too small. HOWEVER, the strap started falling apart in just a few months! It started flaking off black specks which stuck to my skin and my clothes. Now it is so thin that it will break any day, looks really ragged and old. Foolish me....... I'm going to order another one anyway just because I like it so much.
