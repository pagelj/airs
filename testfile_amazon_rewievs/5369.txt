Horrible Item
My mother in law bought this item for us as a baby gift. I had to return the first through the systems horrible customers service center. Just to get another that did not work. Ok. so here goes the spill. The first one the battery went out with in two months. and the second one you can not unplug from the charger. So you get what you pay for. Hope this helps.
