Auto-sleep and Auto-wake Feature is Fab
The best part of the case is how the screen turns on and off when opening and closing the case. The on/off button on the Kindle is a little awkward, so the convenience of having it auto-wake when the case is opened and auto-sleep when the case is closed is one of the best features of this Kindle. The Kindle resumes on whatever screen I was on when I closed the case, not a home screen or an ad. (I have the no-ad version of the Kindle, so I don't know if the ad version works differently). I love this cover. When the Kindle is inserted, it feels completely integrated, like it's a single product. The case has a nice texture, and is easy to carry around. I don't have to worry about smudging the screen or dropping the Kindle because I'm hanging on to it by the edges. It also works well for me when I'm reading lying down on my side, as the screen is propped up by the case. The case clasp is magnetic, so it doesn't flop open no matter what position it's in. The top case flap can also fold behind the Kindle for easy one-handed holding. I thought I would only use the case for travel, but I believe I'll be using it full-time.
