Good to Have
Always good to use UV filters to prevent damage to lenses. I use them with a 2nd Polarized filter. They easily fit on the lens and on each other. Tiffen makes good products and you shouldn't go wrong with one. I use both Hoya & Tiffen, so don't go brain dead trying to decide. You can't go wrong with either. One note on UV filters, in some sunny shots they can reflect off another filter you may be using (i. e. polarized, colored, etc.) or off the lens face itself. If you want to avoid this with sunsets, simply remove the UV filter, the few shots aren't going to kill your lens. Some of us leave them on to get the multiple sun ghost images in sunset shots; your choice. This is a good UV filter, used them for years.
