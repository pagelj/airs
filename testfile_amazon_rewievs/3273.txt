Great bag!
This is a wonderful bag! It fits everything I need to carry and has lots of great pouches and pockets so that it stays organized and I can find everything with ease! If I had to make a suggestion it would be that I think the next model should have a bigger pouch for the telephone. This one is about half the width of any smart phone I've ever seen.
