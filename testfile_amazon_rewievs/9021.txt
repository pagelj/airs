DROID X
THE SHIPPING WAS EXCELLENT AND IT SHOWED UP ON TIME, BUT WHEN I ORDERED IT THE DESCRIPTION DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO THE LCD SCREEN NOW I HAD TO GO AND ORDER ANOTHER LCD SCREEN AND ALSO THE SIDE OF THE PHONE WAS CRACKED LIKE SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO PRY IT OPEN AND FINALLY IT CAME WITH ALOT OF SCRATCHES BUT I EXPECTED IT TO HAVE SCRATCHES BECAUSE IT WAS USED SO I RECOMMEND THAT YOU THINK VERY HARD BEFORE ORDERING A USED PHONE IT MIGHT NOT BE WORTH IT.
