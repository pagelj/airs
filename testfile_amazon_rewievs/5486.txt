Excellent Value
This product is a great value. When comparing this cable structurally to a cable I already owned I cannot tell a difference. Additionally, it produces excellent sound. I cannot tell a difference between this cable and the cable I paid $30 for a few years ago. Comes in an easy to open package. All in all the product is an excellent value and I hope that amazon continues with their own line of cables. A quick thought:If you are a prime user and you use the 3.99 one day shipping option, you are easily undercutting the price of this cable at Wal-Mart and Best Buy. I am an instant gratification guy but I do not enjoy gladiatorial arena that Wal-Mart and Best Buy can often be.
