does the job
Bought this to get an idea if it worked.. Complete satisfaction got it for less than $20 easy setup, I use it when standing and playing music on my laptop.. looks like it fits any laptop, top part where laptop goes there is a foam so it won't slide, sturdy for a holder.. Will try to get another one again for less than $20
