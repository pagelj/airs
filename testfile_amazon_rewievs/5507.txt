A must-read classic for military and hard sci-fi fans
I found the introduction written by John Scalzi in this edition summed up my feelings on the book very well. I have been aware of it for a very long time. A copy of the book even sat on my shelves a number of years ago and was loaned out never to return. I've long wanted to read it. I've been rather embarrassed as relatively hardcore geek to admit that I hadn't yet read it... and now that I have read it I am very glad that I did. I was constantly reminded of the poem "Dulce et Decorum Est" by Wilfred Owen.[...]The sense of disconnect, horror and fatalism found in his work permeates "The Forever War."I devoured Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" in my teens and have read and re-read it. My opinions about it have morphed with age and experience. Haldeman manages a very similar theme but with a deeper, more personal touch combined with more of hard science approach. The insight and bravery required to write this novel at the time are difficult to appreciate sitting here decades later. The strong allegory to the Vietnam War could easily translate to Afghanistan today. A must-read for all sci-fi fans and a strong contender for other readers as well
