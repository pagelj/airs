Easy, great photos, convenient.. what's not to like?
I bought this camera early this year and have had nothing but great experiences using it.  Very nice pictures, takes great videos and is so easy to use.  I don't 'get' the negatives... for me, it's a great little camera.  Definitely recommend... runs on two double A batteries and works great!
