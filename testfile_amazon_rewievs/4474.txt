Can't Upload Video to my Mac Computer
I used this camera last summer while visiting the grandkids. Took some video of their birthday, but when I got home the pictures I took uploaded fine, but the video did not transfer to my Mac. I am not a computer geek so if there is a workaround for this, I have no idea what it is. I have found, via experience, that non-Apple devices do not always work with the Mac. Bummer! As far as ease of use and quality of photos, I have no problem with the camera, but the ONLY reason I bought it was to take video. My (several years) old Cannon digital took great photos but lousy video, however I was able to load my Cannon videos into my computer, whereas my new camera, as stated previously, is not compatible. Later on I took video using my iPad and guess that's what I will do from now on, but I can't lug an iPad around in my pocket :) :) :) And I'm too cheap to get an iPhone which is why I still need a nice camera. If anyone has a workaround for my problem, please enlighten me and I shall be most grateful :)
