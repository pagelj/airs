Good cables for a GREAT Price!
Why people even buy HDMI cables at the store still is beyond me, at most retail stores you won't pay less than $20 for an HDMI cable, some even more than that. Take mine and almost all these reviewers' advice and buy your cables online, for 2 or 3 dollars each you can't go wrong, and if you happen to be sent one of the rare odd wires that are buggy from a seller then you only wasted a couple dollars. But the ones pictured are definitely as good as any wire you will get from a retail store.
