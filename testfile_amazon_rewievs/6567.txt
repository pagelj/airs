THIS BOOK WILL STAY IN MY CAMERA BAG!!!
I have never written a book review before but after reading almost the whole book in one day I had no choice but to give my opinion. I just received this book today 01 Sep 2006 and I can't put it down.  It covers so many aspects of shooting in various modes and makes it simple enough for me to understand. I use a Canon 5D and 20D and have been into photography for about 6 months.  All I can say is that I have looked at several books and read several online forums and tutorials... etc.  This book covers everything I need to know to get that WOW factor out of my shots.  Scott Kelby you are the best and this book is more than GREAT.  When does "BOOK 2" get released.... Anyway, I hope others that get this book enjoy it as much as I do.
