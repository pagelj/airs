Great bag. It has 2 main compartments, one in the front and one in the back. The compartment in the front has a couple of smaller pockets to put stuff inside, pretty simple layout. The straps are really comfortable and will never eat into your shoulders regardless of the content weight. I also had my bag on during slight rain with my DSLR inside. I was worried initially but when I found shelter, my camera and insides were still totally dry. There was an accidental leakage of water from my bottle on another occasion as well, the insides dried up really fast and well. Great multi-purpose, or rather all-purpose bag for most weather conditions and comfort. Just a slight edit for those interested in its durability. I've brought this bag out under heavy periods of rain with a DSLR (Canon 50D) and my laptop inside my bag. I was worried that the stuff inside would get wet so I kind of ran through the rain. The straps were sturdy and allowed me to move pretty fast with minimal obstruction. Upon reaching my destination (which was sheltered) I unzipped the bag and found everything inside still toasty and dry. Great bag for any casual traveller.
