Great display resolution
At last I found a notebook that is light to carry, no battery woes, higher resolution, unbelievable speed and performance and a far more superior design compared to its contemporaries in the market. The speed and performance of the Apple MacBook Air is attributed to the Intel Core i5 processor. Since I am a web designer I wanted a faster processor that can ensure rapid graphics, the Intel HD Graphics 4000 processor does this job fine. Data transfer is done at lightning speed thanks to the Apple Thunderbolt technology. The MacBook Air also provides two USB 3.0 ports that ensure quicker transfer than its predecessor. The multi-touch track pad is absolutely fun to work with especially which rotating images. The HD webcam gives better image resolution making my web chat real. Overall a great notebook to work with.
