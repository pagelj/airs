Good quality product.
I got this network adapter because I thought I would need it to download ebooks for my Amazon Kindle.  I was wrong.  My friend said the wireless router I purchased on Amazon would work fine without the adapter.  So I sold it to him for the $5.00 I paid for it.  I am satisfied.  It was not the seller's fault in any way that I didn't keep it.  I just didn't know I really did not need it. I will give high marks to the seller for the packaging.  The product was in it's original store packaging and then reboxed for shipping.  I think that was great.  The price was great also. Highly recommend this seller!!
