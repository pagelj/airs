Average good lens
I'm not a pro photographer. Before this lens, I only have the Canon 18-55mm IS kit lens with the XSi. Here is what I found. Pros: Solid built, Made in Japan. Clear and great color dept. Cons: Lose sharpness around the center when use in mid and long focal length. I expected a lot more from this lens compare with a Sigma lens that I used before with my Rebel XT. I tried this lens on the new Canon XSi, tested in every mode, every setting, adjust focusing point. The result are same. IT is easy to notice that the edge and around the center of the picture is blur, regardless it was taken inside or outside and in any lighting condition. Recently, I learned from experienced photographer about the ratio between the focal length and shutter speed, it was improved a little bit. That's the only thing I'm concerned about in this lens. I'm sure if you're an experienced person and patient enough, you can find a way to work around this problem. Otherwise, you should consider a Signma or spend more for a Canon lens.
