Problems Out Of The Box
Received item as shipping indicated. Operating instructions are very limited and do not explain all functions or settings. Does not record images very well in indirect sunlight or bright overcast sky. Returned item (which could only be refunded) due to the microphone not working properly, during playback only a high picked squealing noise was heard as well as when you pushed the operating buttons.  UPDATE: Gave the product a second chance and re-ordered this item, same issue as the first item received, background squealing noise. Although not as bad as the first, but still distorts playback sound. Clarity of video is marginal at most. Would not recommend this product even for the price, not worth the time and effort.
