Good price point
I purchased this bag for my new laptop to protect it when I wasn't using it around the house.  I did have some of the lining where a velcro strap attaches across the top of the laptop inside the bag detach so there is a section where the cloth lining has come out.  Otherwise the bag is great and for the price I am happy.
