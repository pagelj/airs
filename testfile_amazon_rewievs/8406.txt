great for the price
I have a Dell XPS M1330 and I bought this (for $0.15) to hookup to my LCD TV. All my favorite shows are on the internet mostly at the TV channel's website. As a result, I don't have cable TV service, I use my laptop, HDMI cable and internet connection. I'm no videophile, but the quality is up there with digital cable. This inexpensive cable and internet is much cheaper than paying roughly $60/month for cable TV.
