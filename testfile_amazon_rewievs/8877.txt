definitely enjoyed this book
Didn't like the title, cover art, or synopsis.  I was suspicious of the mention of student debt and military training.  But the large ratio of 5-star reviews swayed me and I am glad they did. Great book.  Interesting main character who goes through some interesting experiences.  Interesting and believable Pirate characters.  Pirates and raids.  Military boot camp training montage.  Plasma guns.  Ship battles.  Ass kicking.  A complicated government back story which could but doesn't get in the way. I will get the sequel if he makes one, and the dood told me he would later this year. Buy it.
