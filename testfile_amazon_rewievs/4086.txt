I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but I feel satisfied at having ordered it. It's a good color and looks elegant. Works as well as expected. I like the 5 year warranty on it. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the product feels a bit flimsy, but then you get what you pay for I suppose. Similar metal ones are 100+
