more $$ = better camera
Over all its a good camera, but you cant compair it to the nikon d3100, its not in the same price range, the d3100 is obviously of better quality and simpler user interface, the nikon d3000 would although be comprable, and in my experiance is a very easy camera to work with, both the reble EOS and d3000 are good cameras, the d3000 slightly more expensive but also a slightly higher quality camera, cameras can cost in upwards of 12,000$ and in my experiance when it comes to cameras you get what you pay for, buy according to the quality and ease of interface you need.
