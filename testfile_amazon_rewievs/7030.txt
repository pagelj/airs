"Clever", I thought when I saw this thing.  BUT, it never did toast well and if you didn't have really short bread the top half inch or so didn't toast at all. It toasts unevenly as well and it takes a long time.  The egg side worked about 3 times and just stopped.  It's a cheap, but not inexpensive, product.
