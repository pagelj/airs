Excellent Pack
I'm a big fan of my Rush 24 pack.  There is a great amount of space, but the thing that helps it the most is the sheer amount of organizational pockets 5.11 included in their product.  The pack is made of high quality nylon that feels incredibly sturdy (haven't tested this yet) and is water-resistant.  The pack is covered in PALS webbing which is great for attaching extra pouches.  The hydration pocket can just fit a 3L bladder.  Hiking with the pack is very comfortable although I haven't been carrying large enough loads to warrant a waist belt (which this unfortunately lacks, you can attach your own however).  Overall, a great quality pack, well worth the price.
