All I can say is that this is the best vacuum I have owned. After using an old Hoover for awhile, we finally decided to upgrade to this one (since the reviews were so good... figured we would give it a chance) and wow, what a difference. We went over one of the rooms we had just vacuumed and it was like we never vacuumed the place with the amount of stuff this picked, this vacuum rocks. I will say that people are correct in that there is no place to really place the attachments but I'm like, it does the basics really good... and it's not as much as a Dyson. What can I say, I could never spend $400 for a vacuum so the Dyson's were out. I say just put the attachments in the closet and when you need them... go get them... how difficult is that. Anyway, I say get this, you won't be disappointed. LOVE IT!!
