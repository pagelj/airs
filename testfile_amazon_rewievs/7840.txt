Bad cell phone that needs to be replaced
This item was purchased on December 17, 2012 for my granddaughter for xmas and she loved it and took very good care of it.  She notified my around March 10,2013 that when flipped up she could not txt no connection, but could receive calls and make calls.  So, due to my health (Im a disabled senior) I didn't get around to submitting a compaint to the company this item was senyt from (CellTronic) on Matrch 18,2013 Upon numerous attempts they denied me replacement of phone because I had to sumitt by March 17,2013 (3 months warranty).  I was denied because of 1 day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the day March 18th that I submitted the complaint the phone stopped working entirely.  I understand Amazon can do nothing but I am still very disappointed with all. As you can see I am active with you on many levels.  I am on fixed income and because my granddaughter needed a different phone I had no choice but to find her a different one (I'm helping her parents out) I still feel this phone should be replaced, it did stop working before 3 Months. I could still use the replacement for her sister.
