Quite the disappointment
Riddle has come up with a relatively big story line incorporating a dormant alien race and our heroes running all over the planet to help save earth. There's also a fair amount of back filling by going back in time. Although it seems like the author has all the pieces necessary to tell a good yarn it doesnt take long before the reader feels something is not quite right. For me at least, it's like the pieces are just that - they dont come together to a cohesive whole. Too much just happens and is left unexplained; in too many sequences there's a gap between one piece of action and the next. And then there are a few too many "that just doesnt make sense" for me to suspend disbelief any longer. For instance, the protagonists almost seem to be carpetbombing Himalayan China with a slew of drones, but does China even notice it? Nah, not a peep. There's a propeller flight from Indonesia to the Himalaya's that if I recall correctly takes a few hours... really? That same flight ofcourse runs out of gas just as they arrive at their destination. Furthermore, they crash/land a 20 minute walk away from this top secure facility without anyone noticing. And finally there's too much time spent on going back in time and reading about family/love matters that just doesnt move the story line forward. Maybe it would have made more sense to open the story with that instead of slotting it in later. Pass.
