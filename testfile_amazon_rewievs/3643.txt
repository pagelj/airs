not the great vinyl pressing this awesome album deserves
i love this MCR album on my ipod but i really prefer vinyl generally. i was really excited when i saw that there was finally a vinyl release but when i put the record on i was really disappointed how hissy it sounds. listening to a great vinyl pressing always reminds me that kids growing up with mp3s (and to some extent cds) really missed out on the medium that is most likely to create a fulfilling, dynamic and memorable listening experience. the band & record company really should have spent the money on a 180 gram black vinyl pressing instead of flashy gimmicks like a stencil. maybe if we are lucky they will press it again in a few years with the normal artwork and a record that sounds as good as the content of the album. despite how much i love this album i ended up selling it used and went back to listening to the mp3s.
