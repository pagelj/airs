We have used this coffee maker for 1 year. We had Bunn coffee makers for years. We use a permanent filter. My daughter and I drink tea and my wife drinks coffee. We run water thru so we can brew tea  or my wife makes her single cup of coffee. We have used the maker to make a pot of coffee when we have quest over. It works fine. We don't use the timer or in fact set the clock. The water or coffee stay hot for a very long time, as long as you put the cap on after brewing. I have brewed water at 5:30 AM and come home and at 3PM the water is still hot enough to use! We do use a separate container to pour the water into the maker. We are very happy with this coffee maker.
