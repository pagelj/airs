canon gives poor factory service. My camera was a lemon
I have had continuous problems with my camera. I have had professional photographers look at it and they can't get it to work correctly. I sent it in to the Canon Factory and they said nothing was wrong in their note in the return box after telling me they never received it. It came back unable to focus. Again I showed it to professional photographers and they said the camera was defective. I sent it back a second time. This time the factory tried to bill me over $100 on a camera that never worked and without reading all the paperwork their customer care center prepared for them. When I call Canon the people on the phone are responsive and nice but everything falls apart once it is sent into the factory. I even enclosed the memory card so they could see the pictures and see the problem. But they never looked. I think even their own service people are frustrated. But in the meantime I have a $400 camera that has never worked and Canon is not replacing it and seems incapable of fixing it. My daughter bought the same camera and hers works. My husband has the Rebel and his works. I think I got a lemon but if you get a bad camera from Canon you are in touble. I bought the camera through Amazon at Beach camera.
