Decent
I did a lot of research on this camerea before I bought it and overall I loved it. However when taking pictures inside at my daughter school shows I tend to get blured pictures, I think at full zoom you are going to get that. I do think in the living room taking shots of my 1 year old it did pretty good. Someone stole my camera at a wedding and I have been shopping for another one and I did consider purchasing this camera again due to loving it and still have all the items to go with it and I probably will. Overall for the price it is a good purchase.
