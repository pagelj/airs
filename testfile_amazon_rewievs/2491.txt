Perfect Point-and-Click
I bought this camera recently and have been amazed with it so far.  The thee things I love the most are the 20x zoom that is clear Canon quality, the great shutter speed and the lightning fast save to memory card.  The only downside is that the battery life is horrible. Previously I had a Nikon Coolpix S3100.  It was such miserable experience that I just stopped snapping pictures.  It was slower than I could have ever imagined (saving & start-up), the picture quality was horrible, the versatility wasn't there, etc.  Great battery life, though. I needed a camera to make my next vacation a little more pleasant to film and tried this camera in the store.  Needing to carry around an extra battery doesn't bother me thanks to the quality and speed of this little monster of a camera.  I absolutely love it. Based on the hardware specifications (which you can grab online) it looks like a firmware upgrade might be all that is needed to fix the battery life if they ever publish it (I work with similar hardware problems). Easy to use and absolutely great for someone who knows nothing about photography.  I've snapped more memorable, printable pictures with this in under a month than I did in 2 years with the Nikon S3100.
