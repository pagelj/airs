Movie format for USB or SD
I just purchased this player, in preparation for a long car trip. We have our daughter's favorite movies extracted from the DVDs (so she no longer waves them around and scratches them), and all are in MP4 format for iTunes on my laptop, as well as M4V for the hard drive of our bluray player. However, neither of those formats worked with this player - "Audio Codec is not supported" - we could see the video but not hear the words. I had to reconvert the movies to MPG format in order to get them to work. But so far so good. I ordered a 16gb SD card along with this, so I could keep her very favorite movies instantly available, and have the others on a removable USB hard drive. The video quality itself is quite nice, but the built-in menus for the system are very grainy and difficult to read - it takes some getting used to. The bag is indeed quite flimsy, but does the trick. There is a car adapter as well as AC adapter included, which will be useful, although it does say that it won't actually charge while a movie is playing.
