Excellent float
This is an excellent float that doubles as a wrist strap. I originally got it to see if it could keep my GoPro Hero2 a float. I can say that I tested it in a swimming pool and it was able to keep the GoPro2 a float with the dive housing and I had attached a red filter from Backscatter.. You should be cautious about the strap, its not the thickest or strongest of cord. It would definitely snap if you were twirling it around, but it should hold on fine in like ocean waves. I was able to easily replace the portion of the cord that connects to the camera with stronger rope.
