For the price, nothing is better!
I love this laptop. Overall the design is gorgeous, the screen is the best I've seen on any laptop other than the MacBook Pro Retina and the Windows 7 signature software is absolutely the best software Microsoft offers! Here are my pros and cons:Pros:-beautiful 1080p MATTE screen!-Design-Thin and Light-HDMI port-Charging port was surprisingly nice w/Apple-like luminescence-Keyboard (many have complained, but mine is perfect!)-Light-up Vizio logo on lid-USB 3.0-Bluetooth 4.0-Windows 7 signature softwareCons:-Touchpad (worst I have ever used)-Battery life-Only 2 USB portsI would have given this laptop 5 stars if the touchpad and battery life were better. The  trackpad is very, very bad. Literally I cannot state how much I loathe this trackpad. Even after updates, the trackpad is useless for me. When I drag my finger around, the arrow literally jumps around in random directions. The battery life is bad too! If I have my screen at full brightness and wifi on, I will only get 2 and half hours. Even 5 years ago when I had a extremely heavy Acer laptop that got 3 hours, so the fact that this new laptop with lower power-consuming technologies cannot achieve 3 hours is bad. If Vizio fixes the trackpad and gives me at least 5 hours of battery I'll buy this again even at a higher price. Also my review is for the current price I purchased it at which was for $569 new. If this laptop was any price above $699 I would not even consider it, but for the price I got it at, it is the best bang for the buck!
