Jumped through hoops to confirm manufacturer's warranty
The phone itself is perfectly ok, all as described: new (or at least looks new) and unlocked (works on T-Mobile). I was alarmed by other reviews from people who were sold a used phone (with such signs as activated IMEI, scratches, etc).  So I called HTC immediately after unpacking mine.  HTC said the phone was manufactured in April 2011 (which was ok with me), but that they don't know whether the phone's IMEI was activated and advised me that HTC does not have the history of devices' activation at all, only the carrier (AT&T in this case) does.  I asked HTC whether the phone was on warranty, they said that to confirm the warranty status I had to fax them an invoice with phone's identification (IMEI or serial number) printed.  Well, neither IMEI or serial number was on the invoice...  and the seller (Planet Mobile) refused to reissue an updated invoice with said information...  However I faxed the invoice to HTC anyway, and in the next phone call to HTC the representative confirmed that the invoice was valid, that the phone did not have history of repairs in their system, and was able to confirm validity of phone's warranty status.
