Don't let it's size fool you!
Single-handedly the best thing I've purchased aside from my DSLR itself.  I adore this lens.  It is marginally inconvenient having to physically be the "zoom" yourself, but until I get the 24-105 I'm dying for, this is typically my go-to lens for portraits.  People who have nicknamed it the "Nifty 50" have done so quite accurately because this lens is just that... nifty!
