HDMI Cable 2M
The cables work fine.  I can't really tell the difference between this cable and a very expensive cable... so it does the trick.  I have also tried 3D on it, and it seems to work fine (although I haven't tried a very expensive cable to be able to compare). Seems a little shorter than 6 feet, but otherwise, would recommend for the price!
