MARVELOUS PHONE!!
Got the black one. This is an excellent device!!! Phone is really great. It's very fast and the sreen is awesome! Graphics on HD video are extraordinary. Apps works really good and it has Polaris Office, so you can read and Edit your documents (Word, Excel, Power point, etc). Ethernet works very fast (3g-900/2100 Digitel in Venezuela) and phone shape/size it's perfect!!! Definitly the perfect phone for the best price!!! You won't regret it!
