Stainless Flatware Set
The flatware arrived in a box that appeared okay on the outside; however the inside box containing the flatware was a bit beat up.  However, the flatware was in good shape so I proceeded to give it as a shower gift.  The pieces are very shiny and modern looking.  The recipient loved the flatware.
