Enjoy
I have read many of Tanya's books and will read many more. I have enjoyed each and every one of them and use the Novella's to fill in as I wait for the next in the series to come out or inbetween the next. I find there is just one problem with that, for me there is never enough, I want more. In my mind Novella's are not long enough. But, If you are in need of a respit from a long book do try a Novella and enjoy.
