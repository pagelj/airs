Bad card?
The first time I used this card, I was able to take about 20 pics and then the camera would say "image not saved"!! My camera would freeze up for a minute or so and then allow me to take pics. 5-10 pics later the "image not saved" came up again! Needless to say, I am returning this card. I have another Transcend 8gb Class 6 that has worked flawlessly. I don't know if it's the Class 10 that geeked up my Pentax K20d, or what? Or, maybe it's just a bad card. Either way, it's going back.
