great android phone but extreme problems w/ activation!!!
I was actually planing to get one too but..... since my husband had extreme problems with the activation I am not so sure anymore! So the phone was bought and he decided to go for now with the 30$ monthly plan (no contract), which is offered by Walmart and T-Mobile. com. The phone did not work correctly and a connection to the web was not possible after the activation on the phone through a T-Mobile representative. Something went wrong and the problems started! So lot's of phone calls were made by my husband. I have to say the T-Mobile associates were not well informed and decided that the plan which my husband wanted to activate was all the sudden not existing anymore!!! ???  The other representatives just hang up on him. That happened around 5 times. My husband almost lost it and gave it a 6th time a try. He had luck and one of the representatives was willing to help and after checking with her supervisor able to activate my husband phone correctly. He waited around 2 hours and "heureka" the Samsung Exhibit II 4G is working finally. The phone is great! I am also very grateful for all the  reviews which were posted here on amazon. conclusion: great item with a lousy service, provided by unmotivated and partly uninformed T-Mobile staff on the phone! My last two cell  phones had T-Mobile service too and I had always good experience when I went to the T-mobile store, doesn't matter if it was in Germany or in the USA. So I am very surprised about our recent experience!
