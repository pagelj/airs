I've been using this product for a little over two weeks and I love it.  I can jump in the shower and cook my Canadian bacon, egg and cheese muffin.  It is done by the time I'm finished showering.  After eating one of my muffins, you'll never set in a drive thru again. Pros:  It's quick easy to use and clean.  And the food is delicious too. Cons:  The poaching pan is flimsy.  I went ahead and order replacements before the inevitable happens. Over all, I have to recommend this product.
