Spacious like the Sierras
I was looking for a non-canvas bag that I could use daily for to/fro office use and for personal/wknd use as well.  This thing is money! holds my netbook, power supply (half the netbook's size) running shoes, work out clothes AND a bottle of water/sunglass case/ebook reader to boot. Now i'm a big dude, 6'4 size 14 shoes so if I find this thing to be spacious enough to hold all my things, the majority of people out there will be able to carry a week's luggage in this badboy, the possibilities are endless.
