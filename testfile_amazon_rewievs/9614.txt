Nice little phone
I was looking for a second phone to use with the extra SIM I have. Not interested in neither Android, iOS or Blackberry. I own a Nokia N8 so Symbian was out of the equation, then I got left Windows Phone, Meego and WebOs. Since this WebOs phone is a lot cheaper that any Meego or Windows Phone I saw, I went for it, after all I was searching for a backup phone. So, I received the phone and the first thing I saw was the at&t logo on the box, the phone and all written materials. The phone came brand new (with the particular smell new items have) with the wall charger and the data cable. The size is perfect (even the keys on the keyboard could have been a bit bigger) It feels very good in the hand and it's not heavy at all. The screen has a good size and responds very well to touch. It also seems to have the Touchtone back cover but I will test it as soon as I receive the Touchtone charger I ordered. Upon powering on (which takes a while) it asked me to create a palm profile in order to use the phone. I am currently not in the US (in Central America) so I don't have an at&t SIM, so I was affraid there would be some kind of issue with that based on some reviews I saw. I even had the link ready to do the Bypass activation thing, but it was not needed at all! The profile created correctly and I was able to use the phone with no trouble at all (Maybe it's because here the 3g frequency is 850Mhz same as the one AT&T uses?)I have a prepaid card with a data plan so I used it to create the profile. I am playing around with it, still at the learning curve. I haven't figured out how to get to the phone settings as yet so I can set it up to use wifi instead of data to search for updates, but I will keep playing around till I find it. Enjoying the phone so far!
