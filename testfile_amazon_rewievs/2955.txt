Great depth of field for up-close images.
This is a standard lens for me. If you are taking photos of; head shots, objects, pets, etc. This lens is good for you. If you need to zoom then try a longer zoom lens. This will not produce crisp and clear images but is great for those photos you want with a "blurry background". Great for beginners who are learning how to control their depth of field.
