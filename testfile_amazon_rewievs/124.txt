Not good enough
I bought this card in December 2012 along with a Canon Rebel T3. This card works for burst shooting in a jpeg format. I have also done a few video clips with this card. Again, no problems. However, more recently I have started shooting in RAW or RAW plue a large Jpeg. In these formats,the card can't write fast enough to keep up with the camera and it essentially makes my camera worthless shooting in the burst mode (multiple continuous shots) in the RAW photo format. That is the only reason for the 3 rating. For the above mentioned reasons, the card doesn't cut it. If you only do video, shoot single photos, or shot burst saving to jpegs, this card will do a good job. I can't speak to 1080i as my Rebel T3 shoots only 720p. I've put about 4000 images on the card and the write speed just isn't enough for burst shots in RAW. If you don't plan to shoot burst in RAW, this card will probably work well for you. The service from Amazon was excellent and the card arrived in good working order.
