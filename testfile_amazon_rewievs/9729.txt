Doesn't work with USB external drives! Only flash drives!
I purchased this Philips DVD player as a gift for my family.  I chose it specifically so I could plug in an external hard drive, on which I put hundreds of movies and videos for my parents to enjoy, and play the files directly from the drive.  However: the description of the device on this website fails to tell you that the USB port only works with FLASH drives (solid state memory, or thumb drives, usually 2-8 gigs in size these days).  It does NOT work with an external hard drive (the screen reports: "Input Invalid").  I checked the manual and yes, indeed, it is only meant to work with flash drives.  I was horribly disappointed.  The strangest part is that I own an older version of this Philips DVD player, one with a USB port which I purchased on Amazon several years ago, and it plays from my own external drive just fine!  Why would Philips change their design to not allow external drives anymore? The device does, however, work generally very well for DVDs, so as this player was very inexpensive I think we will keep it.  But now I am on the lookout for a USB DVD player which is capable of running an external drive!
