Camera app review
I'm very happy with this app they love me to access the camera function of that what which really doesn't do much does doesn't have a forward facing camera but that's not really the aps fault. It is a great app but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to use the Kindle as a camera or for anyone who just wants to make videos of the other friends messing around is has a camera feature a video recording feature and apples claim to fame the panorama picture taker overall I'm very satisfied with the app.
