Just ok
We love the way this set looks. Good bang for the buck. We usually wash all of our dishes in the dishwasher, but our new dishwasher had to be replaced due to a faulty motor. While it was being replaced we had to hand wash everything... after washing, one of the knifes had a little rust on the blade after sitting in a drying rack overnight. Haven't seen anymore rust, but not too excited about the fact that the set might rust when left wet for a short period of time.
