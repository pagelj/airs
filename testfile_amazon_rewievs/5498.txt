Outstanding movie, Just one metalurgical error.
This was certainly better than the cartoon version Beowulf. It was fresh and fun. Full of adventure and action. My biggest problem was when Canaan said we need stronger metal. Well viking age technology used carbon steel in their weapons. A piece of metal was recovered from Canaan's ship. To be stronger or harder than carbon steel the piece of the ship would have to be Titanium or Beryllium. Both of which have a forging temperature well beyond what a charcoal air driven forge can produce. I guess it could be some kind of space metal not yet discovered. Well, still a great movie.
