After 4 months, buttons don't work correctly
Bought this for my 3 year old, has survived a few plane trips. Cannot hear on an airplane because the volume is too low. She can barely hear with headphones. At home, she uses to watch her DVDs and the volume is good. Looking for a new one though because the buttons don't work anymore. When we press the button for one function (Menu), the player does something else (setup). It is very frustrating, the OK button has to be pressed in a certain spot (top left corner) to work. We have learned how to use the player this way (i. e. pressing the UP button several times to scroll DOWN). The mute also come on periodically without touching anything... so annoying. To my knowledge, the player has never been dropped, but has been used quite a bit. In any case, the buttons should still work correctly after a few months of use. Bummer to have to buy another so soon.
