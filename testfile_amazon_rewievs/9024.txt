For quick pick-ups around the house, I've used several other cordless vacuums; Shark included.  I didn't expect a lot from them because of the battery; not much power; not much suction.  But I heard and read about Hoover's cordless stic vacuum; went to Sears and it looked and felt great, but I didn't want to pay THAT high of price for a cordless vac.  So went to AMAZON; wow, GREAT PRICE and a really great vacuum.  Battery length is acceptable; it charges quickly and the suction is impressive and handles the transition from hard flooring surfaces to carpet quite nicely. And my purchase from Amazon arrived quickly.  Great online buying experience and I don't do it that often.
