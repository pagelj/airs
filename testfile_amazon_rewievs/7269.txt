End of Frustration-Huawei Ascend
I have a Huawei Ascend android phone and one of its few downfalls is that 2.5mm headphone jack.  After trying Best Buy, Radio Shack, Guitar Center (i was desperate) and a few other places I finally found the correct adapter here at Amazon.  If you have this phone.  This is the correct adapter.  It works fine and sounds good. Seems a little fragile but does what it's suposed to do.  Thank you Amazon.
