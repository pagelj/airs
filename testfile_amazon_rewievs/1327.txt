I have a love hate relationship with this vac. When it works -it works great  and for a stick vac it is very powerful and lightweight. The shut off problem that has been mentioned in several reviews is a actually the result of an intended safety feature that kicks in when the unit overheats. Let it sit for a while and it should come back on again. If you don't keep the filter extremely clean in this vac, it WILL quickly overheat. I would recommend buying an extra filter so you can have one ready to swap out in order to this problem. After one year's use (and just after the warranty expired, of course!) The power brush started making noises and then stopped working completely, despite the fact that it was kept free of the usual strings and whatnot that always wrap around. To fix it I had to open the housing (not for the mechanically fainthearted) to re-align the belt. If you open the housing be sure to pop out the two small roller wheels  and remove the screws under or you will break the housing.  There are a total of 6 screws you'll need to remove. The belt (as all belts do) will eventually fail, and since it is not made to be replaced by the average consumer, I fault Hoover with creating a whole lot of potential landfill. They ought to at least offer postage-free electronics recycling if they are making vacs like this with an extremely limited life expectancy. But the ideal would to make a product that can be maintained and/or repaired. Unfortunately, there wasn't any better alternative on the market that I could find for a lightweight corded vac with a power brush. Ah, for a Kirby power stick vac! It would probably weigh a ton, but it would last for decades.
