great camera
we bought this for our daughter's 12th birthday and it is has been perfect! she had asked for a digital camera for her birthday but i wasn't sure i wanted to buy anything fancy or expensive for her first camera. not only was the price great, but i was excited to find a camera that was her favorite color- turquoise. for an inexpensive camera, the quality of the pictures is great. we have also taken it to the pool several times, as well as to the beach, and have never had any issues after putting it completely under water. she has a blast taking underwater photos! it actually makes me wish i'd had this camera when snorkeling in hawaii a few summers ago. the only thing i was a little disappointed in was that it uses AA batteries instead of using a re-chargeable brick like most digital cameras do. at the same time, AA batteries might be better for our daughter because they can be replaced if they get lost. :)for a digital camera, of course there are better ones out there, BUT i would definitely recommend this camera for a kid/teenager's camera or for an adult who is wanting to take underwater pictures and doesn't want to use a cheap disposable underwater camera. VERY happy about this purchase.
