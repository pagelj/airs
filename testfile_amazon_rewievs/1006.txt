Excellent Military Science Fiction
Originally published in 2005, I just got around to reading John Scalzi's Old Man's War. So let's start off by saying I wish it had not taken me so long. The opening paragraph of the book's description sets the stage and is a fine hook: "John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army."This page-turning military sci-fi book is a blast to read. Perry joins the Colonial Defense Force (CDF) and will never return to Earth again (that's a stipulation of the contract), though should he survive the war, Perry will be allowed to live on any of the human colony planets. In Scalzi's future vision, war is constant. Some alien species is always invading and killing off another or trying to or trying to gain control of a planet. Some aliens even engage in battles as religious rites. This book tells the tale of Perry and a few of his friends he meets during the flight to their basic training through that training and a major battle. The plot is straightforward in that sense. Join. Train. Fight here. Fight here. See people die. Fight here. However, Scalzi's imagination is immense, and that straightforward plot feels anything but routine, and his characters have depth and, as inevitably happens, some of Perry's friends die, you kind of wish they had not. Also, Perry's wife was set to join the CDF but died suddenly of a stroke before she turned 75, and Perry remembers her fondly throughout the novel. I say this because it does have a bearing on the story, a part that enriches the overal novel and lifts it from a potentially straightforward plot to a plot with some interesting twists. This is a book that hurtles through its story, and by the end of it, I was wanting more.
