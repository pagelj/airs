Two Things Missing
While there is an app for HuluPlus there is no app for the free Hulu so I still need to use a computer for that. Also thanks to Google there is no app for YouTube so I need to use the app on my LG Blu-Ray player for that. I dropped my DishTV programming to take advantage of my internet connection using ROKU and I also get movies in the mail and I have an outdoor antennae to receive picture perfect local HD channels. ROKU and my 12mbps internet connection give me a sharp picture. So ROKU + Netflix DVD's + Antennae = Freedom from TV provider large bills.
