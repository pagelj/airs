Excellent router, Great Range, Easy Set Up, Very configurable!
I have owned this router for about a month now and I am very impressed. Set up was very easy and is very configurable. You get a wide range of features that make this an excellent home router, or even a decent small business router. It has not crashed at all. I will not go to deep into its specs as many reviews here have already done that. I will say that the range on both the 5 and 2.4 Gig is most impressive. I have driven to to the end of my neighborhood and still picked up my network. I will say, it does get a little on the hot side. I have mine in a media cabinet, and will leave the door open sometimes so it can breath a little better. I hope that this temp. does not shorten the life of the router. I will update down the road to let you know how it is working. I skipped the AC version for obvious reasons, most products just aren't there yet. All in all this is an excellent router. I am very pleased!
