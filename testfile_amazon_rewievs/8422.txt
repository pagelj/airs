Its ok, but expected better from Samsung
I got this blu-ray player when it was $99 during the Black Friday sale. And I was debating because of the mixed reviews I saw, but decided to go ahead and buy it. Pros:Setup was fairly quick, it was under ten minutes to get it updated and install Smart Hub. I've had no problem with the wireless, it connected quickly. Picture quality is amazing, there's no doubt about it. Youtube has been working fine. Now it has split the screen in two in some videos, but I can always find another video were it doesn't do that. So its not really a big deal to me. Cons:The main one is that its just plain slow. It takes about a whole minute before starts playing the blu ray. It just reads and reads the disk, until finally it plays. So as of right now I'm not really thrilled with it. Because it just slow, but I'm going to give it a few more days.
