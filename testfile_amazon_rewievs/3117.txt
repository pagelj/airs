Nice!
This radio is sturdy, well built, and a good value.  Because it is the lower end model, it does not have a place to install conventional batteries, and relies on powering up via cranking or solar cells.  Higher end models have both the core battery for charging, plus an extra compartment for regular disposable batteries.  The sound is okay, given that the radio is small and only has one speaker.  But, I do not intend to use it except during power outages.  The main reason I bought this brand/model is that unlike competitor models, this one comes with a lithium ion battery rather than Ni-cad or other rechargeable batteries.  I tested the extra plugs that come with it on my Iphone 5, just to test the fit, but did not try to charge my phone.  I am confident that if needed, I will be able to get a few minutes of talk time.  Two minor negatives:  1.  The control buttons are fairly hard to push.... not a real problem, just surprisingly hard to press.  2.  It does not have a small compartment to store the variety of plugs that come with it.  I regard this as a STUPID design flaw.  I currently keep the plugs in a plastic baggie next to the radio.  In an emergency, it would be better to have the confidence that one does not have to go "foraging" to locate plugs!!!  Think about it.... the radio's main reason for existing is to be ready for action in emergencies.... clearly, the manufacturer "does not get it" regarding accessories.
