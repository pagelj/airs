Bulky, Buttons Are Hard to Press
We returned this the same day it arrived. It is good to have a toy that's quiet considering this is supposed to be up against their ear. However, where the speaker is located on the back of the phone is exactly where my baby held it so there is no sound at all (or she had it laying on the carpet which covered up the speaker too = no sound either.) Perhaps having it lower on the phone would be better, maybe coming out of the bottom. Also, the buttons are very stiff & were very difficult to press, even for us (her parents.) It is also quite bulky so baby girl had to use both hands to hold it, thus she had no free hand to try to push the stiff buttons. Because she couldn't hear it or get it to work for her, she put it on the carpet & left it there. It's too bad because the Fisher-Price Remote Control toy is incredible!!
