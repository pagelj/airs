Canon Brand
For the price, size, and for my travel here and there needs, this camera works just fine. I own several cameras and another larger Canon camera, but I needed something small easy to carry in a jacket or clip on to my belt, via the case I bought for it.  I am extremely happy with this camera and what it can provide me.
