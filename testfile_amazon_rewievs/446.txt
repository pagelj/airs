The high school backpack
Perfect for my 17year old son who is a junior in high school. It fits tons of books along with protecting his Mac Book pro. We did a lot of research on the net and this is what we thought would be the most stylish yet also the biggest backpack and we were right! It is sturdy, with lots of compartments, and protects his valuables. Highly recommended.
