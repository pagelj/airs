i liked  samsung S3
Hi Guys,i Just bought this phone and i like it a lot. its touch screen performance is very sensitive and good. Besides the OS of Galaxy S3  is upgraded so the apps performance is great and the navigation is so cool as well. the best part i can take a burst of pictures from the camera and select the best one out. its so cool. Thanks All.
