If you couldn't tell by the price, this is an economy vacuum. So this is where they skimped, the cleaning path is only 12.5" (compared to 14-16" paths on other units), assembly requires more steps than typical vacuums (about 4 assembly points vs 1 handle attachment like others), and a lot of the body has a skeletal structure to reduce the amount of plastic used. Where they did not skimp is the suction power which is quite good (we'll have to see after long usage, but it's great right now), the adjustable platform height mixed with the light weight makes this a breeze to use on hard floors as well as thick carpet, they include a power-head for upholstery and stairs, the cords are long enough for most homes, and it doesn't take a lot of room in the closet. These features make it a great vacuum for second-floors, apartments, or if you have trouble with heavy machines. PROS:+ Powerful+ Power brush tool+ Lightweight+ Adjustable height+ Easy empty bagless canisterCONS:- Smallish path requires extra passes.- Initial assembly take 10-20 more minutes than other vacuums.- Switching to the hose for vacuuming requires bending over and is slightly awkward. Overall, it's a great vacuum. Sure there are compromises, but I think they made the right ones to make an a truly light, affordable and capable machine.
