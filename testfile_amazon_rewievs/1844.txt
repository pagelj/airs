I am so glad I bought this!!!
I have never left a review anywhere but I had to after this experience!  The glass on my iphone was shattered and I didn't want to have to replace my phone just yet. I had seen this same part for $25-$99 elsewhere.  I was really skeptical at this price but since I was faced with having to buy a new phone I figured it was defiantly worth a try.  I ordered the part and it took a few days longer than I expected to arrive.  When I got the part in the mail, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality!  My husband watched a YouTube video showing how to replace the screen while he was doing it.  It took a little longer than we thought it would but then again my husband is a perfectionist.  Getting the glue hot enough to get the glass off was the most time consuming part but in the end everything worked perfectly! My phone is back together and it looks and works like a brand new phone!!  Just a note* my husband is really good with this sort of stuff so it may be more difficult for people that are not good with electronics.
