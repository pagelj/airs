Returned for a better player
I was very disappointed with this Blu-ray player. I got it for the fact that is was reasonably priced and could do wireless streaming. Little did I know that the device would require constant updates right out of the package - making it difficult to watch Netflix whenever I wanted. After two days of use and 3 updates, the player stalled out on update and rendered the player useless. I called LG who said they didn't know what was wrong with the device and would have to send me a "disc" to update the player. The disc never came so I shipped the LG player back to Amazon for a Panasonic player that has been nothing but awesome. Others may not have the same issues I did with the LG 670 but I can't recommend based on my experience.
