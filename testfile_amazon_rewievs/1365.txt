works as expected
For under $20 this is a great product for any smartphone, not just the iPhone.  I like the fact that it sticks to my windshield very well.  I had to use a credit card to pry the suction cup when trying to remove it.  It can be swiveled in multi direction and folded down when not in use.  I use it for my iphone 5 with its bumper case on.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to want to stick to the top of my 2010 Lexus ES 350 dashboard, but I think it has to do with the slightly rough and slightly curved surface?  Any tips or tricks to make it work would be greatly appreciated.
