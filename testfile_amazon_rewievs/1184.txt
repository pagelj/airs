I love the coffee pot, it's very easy to use and program. One downfall though; be very careful when opening and removing the coffee pot out of the box. The carrafe is wrapped individually out of the plastic bag that the coffee pot is in. If you pull on the bag to remove the pot, the carrafe gets shoved out of its niche in the coffee pot and will undoubtedly fall out onto the floor and break. The carrafe is expensive: about $20-25!  Cuisinart will not replace the carrafe because they do not cover losses such as broken carrafe, their instructions state to place the box on its side prior to removing the coffee pot, but the instructions telling you this are inside the box and not easily accessible, and besides who reads instructions on how to remove the coffee pot out of the box before removing the coffee pot from the box?  It should be packaged better, but otherwise I'm happy with my purchase, but not happy about having to purchase and spending an additional $25 for the carrafe.
