Unexpectedly Perfect!!
I read the reviews on this one and still wasn't sure, but it was a free book so I gave it a shot.  How glad I am that I did!! Here are some of the things that I liked about this book:* The fairy godmother is the antithesis of what we've been taught to expect of fairy godmothers.  Personally, the Princess Worship Culture we're surrounded in rather disgusts me, so I found Danika to be a delicious breathe of fresh air.  She is awesome and makes me eager to read the rest of this series.* The book takes place after Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland has already been released (a fact mentioned in the book, because even Alice drools over Johnny Depp!). - Burton's movie re-energized the story, giving it a unique twist and letting it be a little more grown up.  I think that helps the reader make the trasistion fluidly from the children's story to a fully grown-up, adult version without it being weird.  Which brings me to my next point..* This isn't just a grown-up retelling of Alice in Wonderland.  Yes, there is Alice, there is the Hatter, and there is Wonderland, but it isn't the same story - not by a long shot.  This was something that had me hesitant to read this but once I realized how different an angle Hall was taking .. well, WOW!!* Can someone really write the Hatter without being too goofy or cliche?  The answer is "yes"!!  Hall's Hatter is a remarkable Hatter.  He is mad, his world is mad, and she makes it real without falling into the goofy or cliche'd traps.* This book was longer than I expected for a free book too.  That was a nice perk. I really am looking forward to reading the rest of this series.  Marie Hall has me hooked, even though I'm no TinkerBell! ;)  However, I would be remiss if I didn't say that first she makes me want to go bake some cupcakes!! Those creations were impressive!
