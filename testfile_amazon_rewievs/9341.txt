best thermo i found so far
i bought this thermo a few weeks ago and i really like it so far.  the hot drink stays hot for a very very long time, this beat out on any other thermo mug i have purchased in the past and i have purchased quite a few, nothing even came close.  it does not leak if you cover it right and the the locking feature is a plus from accidents.  the top where the drinking sprout is very easy to clean.  i can't find anything negative with this thermo at all.
