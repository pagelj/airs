They enjoy it!
I got this as a Christmas gift for my parents who are in their early 60s. My father definitely gets more use out of it than my mother (he's made his way through a couple shows on Netflix already), but it's a nice option for them both to have. I've used it quite a bunch myself while at their house and I'm quite impressed with it also. Setup was mostly a breeze (I had a hard time figuring out how to set-up the audio to go through our sound system vs. the TV, but father got it to work just fine). The interface is very easy to figure out and looks good, too. Sometimes the screens lag (not the shows, just moving between episodes, for example). I don't know if this is the Roku or their internet connection. Anyway, I think this is a great little device for those who don't already have a device to stream media like this (e. g. an XBOX).
