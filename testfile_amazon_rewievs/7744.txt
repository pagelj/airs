worked exactly as advertised.
i plugged in my camcorder to the supplied cords, an old one from the 90's and it worked perfectly, then I plugged in an old vaccuum tube style TV that had a VHS tape player and it also worked perfectly.  You can manipulate the start and stop times with the software too.  It really is a great way to convert your old VHS and 8mm tapes to a DVD format.  You can use it to upload to YouTube or Vimeo too after you burn to a DVD.  This product is awesome.  I love it!  Worth every penny.  Shaun T in Boise IDAHO.  shauntracy@gmail . com
