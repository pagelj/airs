I got this vacuum because I have hardwood floors and a  little white dog that sheds all over the place.  Year round. The dust cleaners just didn't do the job well enough. This little vacuum works great.  I have back problems and pushing a regular vacuum was too hard on my back.  This vacuum is very light and easy to use.  And the auto rewind for the cord is fantastic. The only problem with it is that the cord is too short. You have to plug into each room you're vacuuming.  And it does not work well on rugs.
