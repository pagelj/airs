once in awhile
Once in a while you get a product that does everything it's supposed to do and more, this Kindle is one of those. I'm a "mature", (ok old) low tech user and even I had it set up and running in no time. I took it on vacation and was able to read books and check my e-mail with one devise. It does lots of other tricks to, but as a low tech geezer I don't use them as much.
