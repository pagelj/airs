cheap, cheap, cheap
I really don't get all of the positive reviews for this purse.  I normally wouldn't order a handbag online but decided to based on all of the positive feedback.  Boy was that a mistake.  This thing looks like it's made of cheap plastic.  There is little organization inside it.  The zipper is longer than the purse.  And the snaps inside that you have to snap to give it it's shape won't stay snapped.  You might be happy with this if you are used to buying purses at some place like Walmart but if you have any standards at all don't order it!
