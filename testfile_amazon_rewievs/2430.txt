Well written, but very depressing!
I'm an avid SciFi reader and was initially intrigued by the background to this plot. However, the story didn't delve enough into the reason why or how a computer virus had started in the first place. The story focused mainly on the triumphs and challenges faced by our main band of characters (and boy, it got quite depressing in some parts!). Having said this, the author did some wonderful character development and although in the main the book wasn't my cup of tea, it was still captivated enough by the characters in the book to continue reading. So, its more of a drama of dealing with some major adversities rather than a sci-fi book - but well written at that.
