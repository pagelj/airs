Does the Job!
The right arm for the vesa 100. I am using it for 24" Monitor. Good support and stay! Have different arm that can not keep stay at certain spot when extended. One thing to remind is make sure it is align vertically before you screw all the way down. Otherwise, you can see the monitor is not perfectly position. Just my pet peeve.
