Great Stove Great Deal
This product is great and I would definitely recommend buying it. This is one of those rare products where you feel like you got more than your moneys worth. The quality is right up there with the brand name stoves that cost upwards of $40. I have used it quite a bit and the piezo igniter still lights on the very first try every time.  This stove throws a flame that it could double as a military grade flame thrower and boils a pot of water in minutes. For the price I will buy a few and them out to my back packing buddies as Christmas gifts.
