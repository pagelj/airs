Incredible Value
Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich)Externel StorageFast (No lag on Angry Birds or any basic application. Smooth Scrolling)Samsung Kies (Multi OS support for syncing music, videos, etc. Works really well)I actually bought a Kindle Fire and tried it for a few days before returning it. Even rooted, the Kindle Fire is nowhere near the level of the Tab. The only downside to not getting an Amazon Kindle Fire is limited access to the Kindle store (You don't get the account upgrade). That being said, the Tab 2 is a MUCH better value over the Kindle Fire. Well worth the additional $50. Don't hesitate to buy it. It's obviously not an iPad, but it's also half the price of an iPad so it's not fair to compare the two.
