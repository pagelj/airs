I'm glad The Phoenix Conspiracy is part of a series
I'm glad The Phoenix Conspiracy is part of a series, because I hated to see it end. Great plotline, relatable characters, and it also had what I believe is the most important part of a science fiction novel: believablity. The futuristic culture is close enough to modern-day to be easily understood, yet just different enough to make a pleasant reading experience. However, a good story isn't enough for five stars. It must also be well-written. Unfortunately, The Phoenix Conspiray is laced with sentence fragments, misplaced commas, and the word [here] (in brackets!) randomly placed. If these errors get fixed, then I'll gladly revise this review to the five star rating this book deserves, but until then I'm only going to give it four.
