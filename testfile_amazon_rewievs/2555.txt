D90 is just fine
The Nikon D90 kit with lens is excellent quality for the money, but beware, it has over 20 buttons to figure out. So the first time I used it, I just put it on automatic and hoped for the best. The shots were a little overexposed, so I read the manual. The next shots were underexposed. So you have to toy with it a bit to get it just right. Most of the buttons and settings you will never use. I have 3 friends that all use this camera, and get impressive professional results. The camera is weighty compared to say a Canon Powershot, and it's not going to fit into your pocket. But overall, this is an outstanding SLR camera.
