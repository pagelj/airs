Great buy!
We purchased these DVD players after our Phillips brand stop working. After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical on spending the money if they were going to stop working after only a few uses. But, with two young kids and a long road trip ahead of us, we decided to give them a try. We are very pleased! Not only do they keep our kids entertained but they can play the same movie or two different movies so either way the kids aren't arguing over which movie. Also, it has memory of where the movie left off so when you recrank the car it automatically starts the movie in the same spot! A big bonus for us as our last Phillips DVD seat didn't have this feature. We have had the players for several months now and are pleased with them so far!
