Color selection
I ordered the green leather based on the photo - it appeared to be a bright, vibrant green.  In actuality, the color is a bad mix short of olive, closer to day-old avacado.  Very disappointing.  The securing clips barely fit over the kindle fire.  I'm not sold on the design and less than satisfied.
