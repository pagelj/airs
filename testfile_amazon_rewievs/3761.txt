Best Poort Mans Camera Bag
Amazon has done a great job on these.  They are solid, well constructed, and stylish. There are two "minor" cons.1. The amazon logos everywhere are a bit much.  Nothing a sharpie did not fix.2. The velcro setup on different areas is a bit cheesy, but this is how its done on Camera bags that are 5-times or greater priced.  Its a great bag.  Get one.
