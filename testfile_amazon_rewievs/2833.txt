When I got this set I did not realize that they are all fluted serrated knives other than the santoku knife so I was initially disappointed, but once I tried these I just fell in love with them. They are now my favorite knives, I like them even better than Henkles, because you don't need to sharpen them and the price is right on! I was so surprised how smoothly these knives slice through anything and since they are so sharp it is easy to control the blade to make perfectly even slices.
