Camera lived up to reviews and then some
I found many reviews of the Nikon D90 before I purchased it.  They said it had the features I wanted without costly extras. They were right! Excellent optics, easy to use, intuitive display, decent instruction booklet. I would highly recommend this product for amateur and semi professional photographers.  Excellent quality pictures, not overly heavy, good quality for the money.
