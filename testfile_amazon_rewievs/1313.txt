Panasonic at it's Best
I love these Panasonic KX-TG7643M phones.  The size is just right... not too bulky, but not too tiny, either. The talking Caller ID works great.  I like having a Clock on the handset display.  I love that these use a standard size "AAA" batteries, so when the batteries wear out, I can go to any store and buy replacement rechargeable batteries.  I also like the feature that allows me to use the cordless phone, even during power outages, just by leaving one of the handsets on the base unit for battery back-up.  I have been saving one of my OLD corded phones for power outages, but now I can finally get rid of the corded phone.  Be aware that the KX-TG66xx series Panasonic phones DO NOT have this feature!
