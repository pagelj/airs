Very useful
Light weight, sturdy enough for a 17" laptop.  Wish there were a place for a mouse but I also bought the Quick Desk Portable Lap Desk and it works fine.  Love them both.  My husband and I had a rather comical time getting the legs adjusted just right.  A little patience is recommended.  I use it in my recliner and the only thing that touches my thighs is the cross bar.  My legs no longer get warm.  Love all the configurations.  Used it in bed the other day and worked very well.  I would highly recommend it.  Good price too.
