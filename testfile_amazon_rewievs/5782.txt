Could not put it down.
I felt God telling me to buy this book. SO I did. I put it on my bookshelf and was very hesitant to pick it up and read it. When i did, not only did I finish it 2 days later, but I was also transformed by it. I know for a fact God was at work through Francine Rivers and I look forward to seeing what God will do next with her novels. Such a beautiful portrayal of unfailing, unrelenting love!
