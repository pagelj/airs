Is Amazon making a huge mistake?
I kept reading 1 star reviews hating on this release because you had to flip the disc in the middle of the movie. I had watched the extended version of the film and was never asked to flip the disc. I finally figured out that Amazon is including the DVD reviews (mostly 1 star) along with the Blu-Ray reviews (usually 4 or 5 stars). This seems like a bad mistake, as it drags down the overall rating on the Blu-Ray release. As far as the release itself? It's pretty amazing. It's nearly everything the original release should have been. I'm docking a star, because the studio clearly held back on including James Cameron's commentary track and on a 3-D version of the film. So, if you CAN wait another 8 or 9 months, I'd recommend doing so to get the definitive edition of this movie. It bugs me that they kept Cameron's commentary off as further incentive to buy a THIRD version of this Blu-Ray. Anyway, I ended up buying this version. I guess I'll just have to miss Cameron's commentary, because I'm not buying this again. I'm happy, overall, with the release. There ARE a LOT of extras included. I've only gotten through about half of them. I also think the extended edition of the film is an improvement, as it adds quite a bit to Sigourney Weaver's character arc. And it gives you more of an idea of the polluted conditions on earth (right down to people having to wear oxygen masks to breathe properly). Long story short? If you're okay with only owning the 2-D version of the movie and not having Cameron's commentary, this version fits the bill. If you'll end up unable to resist the next release, why not just wait and rent the movie until then? Hopefully, at that point, Amazon won't still be including DVD reviews in the Blu-Ray section.
