Good in theory, not so good in reality
Nice looking bag, but with flaws. Converting to backpack sounds good in theory, but it slides though the loop and looses balance. Even when trying to carry on the shoulder, the strap does not have any traction and just keeps sliding off. Included wiper box does not keep close and dries up the wipes.
