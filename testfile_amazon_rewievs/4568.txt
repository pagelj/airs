don't get sucked in
this was a cute light read. and for free you can't go wrong. but it's a trilogy and you'll have to spend $3 on each additional book especially if you're like me and just have to find out what happens once you're invested in the characters. the series is shallow and the main character gets more annoying as the series progresses. saying all that i did buy and read them all so it wasn't all that bad.-written on kindle touch.
