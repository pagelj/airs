I just love this appliance!!! Others have complained that it is noisy and blows a lot of air while vacuuming. I don't deny that this is true, but to me the way it picks up dirt makes up for it. I live in a garden apt with two exit doors. The cross breeze and dirt from the gardens surrounding the apartment blow in a lot of dirt, and tiny pebbles, but my baby picks them right up. I've even demonstrated it to friends and family. They've given me some odd looks and believe that all the dirt I've picked up after my demonstration was left over from the previous times I'd used it! The nerve! But anyway, if you're looking for a very reasonably priced vacuum, that is relatively light weight and quite durable, then this is the machine for you! I hope Eureka reads this and considers manufacturing it in a more desirable color. :)
