great compact camera
I am an advanced amateur photographer and wanted a pocket size camera when carrying my larger one would be awkward. I have had 3 Panasonic cameras and have loved every one. The quality of the pictures is excellent, reflecting the great Leica lens. There is plenty of flexibility in settings to give me the range of photography that I want. The flash, while not as strong as an external one, is certainly adequate for most shots. I can recommend this camera without reservation.
