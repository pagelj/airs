Don't waste your money!
This camera absolutely sucks. My husband and I purchased it to take pictures during our anniversary getaway and it was terrible! It takes forever to focus and take a picture and when it does, it's not of very good quality. Save your money. You'll be sorry you spent it on this piece of junk.
