Great cables for PS3 XBOX 360 and anything HDMI
I received these cables extremely fast even over a holiday weekend, I spent a few minutes searching for good quality HDMI cables to replace existing ones that I had for about a year for an HD DVR receiver and PS3 and a new XBOX360. The main reasons I began my search was because the existing cables I had, both different brands but both purchased at well know retail stores and both being over 30$ a piece, had problems with flickering and dropping picture for a few minutes on start up on the PS3 system. It was always something I chalked up to just being something with the system and TV, but it had done it since day one. After really thinking about it and being ticked off that it wasn't working as it should I said I'm going to replace these cables and give my XBOX360 some love. I liked the reviews on the media bridge HDMI cables and the price was even better but I wasn't 100% sure they were gonna be any different. The moment I open the box and got my hands on these cables I could see they were legit, great feel to them and very durable, built very well and strong better then both big name cables I was about to replace. Hooked the cables up and both had that fit all tech savvy people know and love, and turned on the system and boom PS3 was happy, no jumping screen or flickering or dropping and re appearing. I'm happy I bought 3 of these cables because everything I have now is plugged in snug with these cables. Bottom line great cables and I mean great because build, cost, and style. Also a great thing about these cables are they are set up for future use since the are fast and 1.4v grade, my TV is still a 1.3 but while thinking of upgrading I know my cables will not need to be changed. If you've read this review sorry to drag on but just stop reading and click proceed to checkout these are the last HDMI cables you'll need and media bridge so far is a company I trust.
