Small, inexpensive, and pretty convenient camera case
The camera case is the perfect size for our small point & shoot digital camera. It seems reasonably sturdy. After a year of use, it is still in perfect condition. The only complaint is that the zipper requires a straight on pull of both sides to open easily with one hand. Sometimes, when your other hand is tied up, this can be a bit tricky. Not a big deal, but it could be better.
