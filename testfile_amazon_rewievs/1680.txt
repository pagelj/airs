Illuminated Led buttons do not work
Just for the record, the advertised feature of "ILLUMINATED LED LIGHTS", which was one of the reasons why I bought this toaster, DOES NOT WORK. I am not going to send the product back, because ,at least for me, doing that is a pain you know where. So I am keeping it, but, Amazon should investigate wether this is just my toaster or is a generalized failure.
