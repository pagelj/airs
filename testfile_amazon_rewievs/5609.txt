DVD player works great, case is pretty bad(low quality)
The DVD player saved us on a cross country road trip, our 1.5 year old was mesmerized and subdued making the drive bearable. The DVDs are a little tricky to change due to the way it sits in the head rest case. The volume and picture quality were good and it was easy to use the case rip in two different places days after we started using it. So we had to find ways to fix it so it would continue to hold the player. IF it wasn't the low quality case i would have given this product a 5 star rating. The price is very right.
