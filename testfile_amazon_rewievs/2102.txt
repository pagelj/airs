I am so pissed.
Hello everyone to those who reads this commentary. First off, I would like to note that this tablet is very, very fragile. The first time we brought one, it was for our son for a Christmas gift. That broke within 2 weeks, because he dropped it from the leather couch to a plush carpet, and then the screen shattered... on a carpet floor. we figured with the second one, it shouldn't be that serious... yeah, right. The second tablet was purchased on February 16th; unfortunately he went on punishment towards the beginning of April, where he wasn't able to use it until yesterday (last day of school). I charged the tablet for him, and he uses it, but once the battery died out, he couldn't charge it on his own charger. I have a secondary charger my own, so I go ahead and charge it in that small pin area overnight. this morning, I go to check it, and the damn charger port has broken inside of the tablet. my teenager hasn't even had a chance to use it within two months, if that. This is ridiculous. There is no way that I would recommend this tablet to anyone who chooses to get a less expensive one for their kids. I work in retail, so when I tell you that you get what you pay for, please believe my words as I am now the victim of those very words: you want a quality electronic product, you better spend that money.
