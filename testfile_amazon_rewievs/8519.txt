Five stars
1500 plus reviews, so I'm not sure if this will ever get read, but this stand worked as well as you could ask on my 60" plasma. They must have re-written the instructions too because they were perfectly clear to me. The only negative is the level that is supplied is not accurate but I didn't buy this for the level so I won't deduct anything for that.
