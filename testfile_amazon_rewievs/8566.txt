Easy to install
I mounted a 50" Panasonic Plasma TV using this kit.  The kit is easy to use and quick to mount.  The included hardware is decent quality and multiple sizes of bolts are included to attach a TV.  I would recommend a quality level and stud finder for installation.  It is crucial to have to mount level and also to drive the fasteners directly to the center of the wall stud.  Additionally,  I drilled pilot holes to prevent splitting of any wood. Once the bracket is mounted to the wall and the TV brackets are on, be sure to hook up all required cables to the TV. There is some room behind the TV after mounting, but not much and it can be difficult to connect any cables. Also I recommend using 90 degree connectors for HDMI cables. Actually lifting and placing the TV on this mount is best done with 3 people - two to hold the TV and one to look in back to guide the TV on the wall.
