Really Nice
This is a very, very solid laptop.  Well worth the $ 399.00 I paid.  Been using it heavily for 3 weeks now and it's never missed a beat.  Primarily used for emails, surfing, word processing, minor photo editing, running some astronomy software, ITunes stuff.  Upgraded to the latest touchpad drivers offered by Asus.  My touchpad works GREAT and is pretty much as good as those offered by Apple.  Don't use the W8 tiles as I boot to the standard W7 desktop view.  W8 is solid.  Love the keyboard.  Plan to continue running my machine stock as I don't see a need to modify it!!  Might get a portable USB battery to increase life and use with a few other devices I own.  But in closing, I've had fantastic luck with my X202e.  It's just what I needed for how I use it.  Hopefully it'll continue to work well like my now 4 year old Asus 1000He.  In fact, I still own my 1000He.  It has never let me down, but it was time to purchase a newer machine.... thus my X202e.
