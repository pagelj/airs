Good memory card
Good price for a 16GB, class 10 SDHC card.  However, at the same time that I bought this Transcend memory card for use in my new Panasonic DMC-FH25 camera I also bought a less expensive AmazonBasics 16GB, class 10 SDHC card.  So far I am unable to detect any significant difference between them that might justify paying the higher price for the Transcend.
