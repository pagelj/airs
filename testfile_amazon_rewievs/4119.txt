Great case for the moment... minor flaw, but not against the seller or the item itself.
Ok, this is a great case & it keeps the phone pretty protected for a brief moment. It's nothing like the OtterBox that I reviewed earlier. It's a good case though for what it can protect. The reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't have the words "Nintendo Game Boy" below the screen, so that's something you have to be prepared for with purchasing this case. It's HIGHLY affordable, but just bare in mind that this case isn't containing many features so you have to take this into account.
