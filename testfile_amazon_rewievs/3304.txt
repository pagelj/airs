Wonderful Product
This griddler is well made.  It has a good solid feel to it and it looks great on my counter.  I use it to make grilled cheese sandwiches and for burgers and fish.  They all come out great and clean up is easy.  This is a much nicer product than one of the plastic ones that are available everywhere.  The stainless steel is very nice,  Highly recommended.  Cuisinart always comes through.
