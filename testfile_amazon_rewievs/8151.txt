It works well
It's a real money saver in my case. I live in the mountains and i refuse to pay what these dish companies want,to watch reruns anyway. Granted i know netflix and what not are reruns also but it's not every month. You have wireless internet you can use this,i love i heart radio which is free,and there's a lot more free things with it. So between my digital antenna and my Roku my tv bill a month is 0,i get antenna tv with my antenna and the news,, and a couple others and that's fine.
