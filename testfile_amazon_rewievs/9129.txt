Grandchild loves her Christmas Gift
This inexpensive little Tablet brought tears of joy to my 11 year old grand child.  The price is reasonable and this item exceeded my expectations.  She can easily download games, movies, and can use the internet easily.  It is slow sometimes but she needs to learn a little patience as most children lack these days. Its a great tool or diversion while she and I are taking road trips or even traveling. I love it.
