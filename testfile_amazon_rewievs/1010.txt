Amazing camera!
I went from a Canon EOS 30D to the Canon Rebel T3i. I am by no means a camera expert, just a hobbyist. I cannot say how amazing this camera is. Such amazing detail and functionality. It will make you think you are an expert. I will update after a few months but for now, I am in love!9 DAY UPDATE- Still really like this camera. I have noticed that it doesn't want to focus very well in low light sometimes, may be the kit lens I am using or I may not be using the correct setting. Overall very nice camera and fast.
