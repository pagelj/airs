I absolutely love this toaster.  The toaster itself I'd give maybe a 4 out of 10 because it is inconsistent on toast and really tends to dry it out more than my regular toaster but with the added convenience of making eggs takes this toaster over the top.  We have started buying 3 dozen eggs at a time.  It is just super-convenient and my son loves it.  Whole wheat toast and an egg x2 = perfect breakfast. Ok so I am about 8 months into this and my son is still eating eggs sometimes 3 times a day.  This gets used constantly!  that being said if you are getting one be prepared to buy more poacher trays.  We are on our second set and they are worn out.  I'm careful how I clean them and they still tend to lose their nonstick surface rather quickly.
