Buy from this seller
I was sceptical about buying this from 3rd party and not at&t. Didn't want their hefty plans. Meant to use it with t-mobile. I bought a 3G version first. Didn't work with t-mobile after a week. Abe replaced it promptly after I decided to go with a 3GS. Still didn't work with t-mobile in my house. Another email exchange with Abe who assured me they tested with t-mobile before shipping. Bottom line: Good seller; Bad t-mobile service; Good unlocked phone. Bonus tip: QDOS clear shell case seemed to make t-mobile signal stronger. Could be a coincidence.
