good backpack
I have used Swiss Gear back packs for years now. They stand up so much better than other  backpacks and I put them to the test. I like the black color, multiple compartments with extra pockets in some of them as well as outside easy access pockets. My only complaint is that one of the zippers seems to give me trouble and I am not overstuffing it. Never had this issue with Swiss Gear before. I am chalking it up to one bad zipper experience but overall a good product.
