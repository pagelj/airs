The best media player currently available
The design of this product is engineering genius. Extremely small footprint, RF remote (no need to point directly at device), and incredibly fluid user interface. The device along with the remote also feel to be manufactured with very high quality. The remote control is very simple to use and feels very ergonomic. The headphone jack in the remote was a brilliant idea. No longer do I need a super long extension cable to run from the receiver to my headphones. The product has been rock solid without any glitches so far during our first month of use. We use it mostly to watch Hulu Plus and Netflix and play Pandora radio. The only thing that would have made this device absolutely perfect is if it could play network media natively. We have a library of music and movies on a network drive and there is no way to watch without using something like Plex. I set up Plex but noticed that the quality was not the same as watching on my Western Digital HDTV. As such, for now we have both devices set up. Not a huge deal but I hope that the next Roku adds local network media support. With high quality devices like the Roku, will cable/satellite even be relevant in a few years?
