Just too small
This is a pretty good backpack but it's just too small. The fit is pretty good and was comfortable after getting it adjusted for my height but I don't know that someone over 6-foot could find enough adjustment. Sleeping bag would not fit in the bottom compartment no matter how forcefully I tried to pack it in bit by bit. The top compartment is convenient but the small opening to the rather small main compartment made it difficult to load and unload.  Overall it doesn't hold very much gear.  Glad the hike was only 2 miles in for a single overnight.
