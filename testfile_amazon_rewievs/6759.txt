Fun Roku
On the Roku front, it works exactly as my old Roku did--so five stars all around for that. The hand-controller is a nice touch, though it is sometimes difficult to use--but I don't own a Wii, so perhaps this is user error. Friends got a kick out of playing Angry Birds on TV (and one roommate became addicted to it), and I love the ability to download new games (for a fee, of course). You Don't Know Jack was a nice throwback to 1998, but doesn't play the same as it did back then, so it was limited in it's fun factor. You won't be disappointed with this Roku player, it has a lot of function for the price!
