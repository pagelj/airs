I am very displeased with this product and the warranty.  I purchased this coffee maker one year ago with a three year warranty.  Today it stopped working entirely.  Called customer service and was told to unplug the unit, fill it with 6 cups of white vinegar and warm water and let it sit for one hour.  Plug in the unit one hour later and it should start working.  It did not.  Called customer service again; they were willing to send a new unit, however I was told that I would have to send a $10 dollar fee.  The unit was under warranty and I do not feel that I should have to pay to have it sent back as it was a defective unit.  I have owned Mr. Coffee's in the past and have never had to deal with a return cost.  I feel that because the unit was defective and I was under a 3-year warranty that it should have been sent back and a new one returned to me at "NO" cost.  I do not recommend this product and will never purchase another cuisinart product.
