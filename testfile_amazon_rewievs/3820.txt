I own just about everything Shark ever made--largely because of my experience with the Navigator, but also with the Ninja blender. I have had my Navigator for going on 2 years, and it has taken a beating, but works just as well as the day I bought it. I have owned a $600 vacuum (an Electrolux) that can't hold a candle to it when it comes to suction. If I had to replace it every year, I think it would still be worth it--believe me, I went through vacuum after vacuum until the Electrolux, which lasted a long time, but nonetheless never had the cleaning power that my Navigator had.
