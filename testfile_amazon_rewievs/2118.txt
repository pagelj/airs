This little vacuum is exactly what I needed.  It picks up the crusty bits around my daughter's highchair and the furry bits that the cats and dog leave behind, and the various bits on the kitchen tile.  I own a large vacuum for my rugs and this was not purchased to replace that, but to compliment it. It is very lightweight, not too noisy, has enough cord to move from one room to another in my small space and, most importantly,  fits on a hook in my cramped broom closet. I can grab it, sweep and put it away in a matter of seconds.  It even has a rotating bristle that can be turned on if you need to use it on carpets or rugs. What more could you ask for?  I LOVE it.
