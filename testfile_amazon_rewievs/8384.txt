This toaster is great!  I bought this toaster before reading the reviews, after reading them I tried to cancel my order and was unable.  I thought what the heck I'm going to try it. After a few months of use here is my review. This toaster has been great and I haven't had any issues with it.  It hasn't exploded or failed to work properly.  I would purchase this toaster again.
