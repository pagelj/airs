Works great and at a great price
I was really impressed with the Youngnuo flash.  It made me question why I was spending so much money on Canon flashes.  Granted, you don't get TTL, but this flash, coupled with an inexpensive CowboyStudio trigger seemed to work more reliably than my Canon flash coupled with the more expensive Pocket Wizard.  I'm also using it for a Fuji X100 and it works perfectly.
