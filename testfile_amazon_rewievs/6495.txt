Strong magnets
This strip is very strong. I have knives all across it and not little paring knives--butcher knives. I have had them on the wall for over a week and nothing has even shifted. I'm confident that they are now securely attached to the wall. Installation was simple and the instructions were good. The packaging was easy to open and not wasteful in design.
