I really do like this thing.
So, I was coming from an Apple TV 3. I wanted far, really far more choices than that device offers. I had a roku 2 and didn't care for it much. It was slower the the apple and I didn't like the user interface very much. The roku 3 on the other hand, fixes both those concerns. It's very quick and the UI has changed as well. Clearly, the Apple TV has a few features you either really dig, or could care less about. I'm mainly talking about AirPlay and iTunes Match or more generically playing your local iTunes library. I have an ipad retina and a Mac and don't use either. The channel selection was what mattered to me. This box excels at that. There are certainly far more channels of garbage than you might like, but you don't have to have them selected and you might find a few gems you never knew existed. All in all, I think it's great.
