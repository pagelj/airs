Move over Farscape, your successor just blew into town!!
I've read several stories by M Pax, and as usual, I wasn't disappointed with The Backworlds. Wow, what a fun and fascinating read! The characters are so varied and colorful yet believable, the otherworldly settings are described in such a way that you "see" them. Even the foul stench of the ale that Craze, the main character, detests seemed to make my nose twitch! But it wasn't only the authors mastery of creating a believable universe that I enjoyed. The Story itself kept me glued to my Kindle even when chores were calling my name. Predictable storylines bore me. But M Pax keeps surprising me with twists and turns I didn't see coming. What a fun romp through the backworlds with these feisty bio-engineered beings from a future time. OUR future, creations from the old "fabled Earth". Can't wait for the next in this series, Stopover At The Backworlds' Edge. Ha ha, in fact I just bought it. :-)
