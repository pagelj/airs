What an ordeal !
I was really hoping this would allow me to see and possibly repurpose some of my thousands of vhs tapes. I tried to save money by buying 2 identical refurbished decks. Usually refurbished has not been a problem, but this is THE exception. This is the worst product ever to bear the Magnavox name. The first one I opened had no front-panel display. It would stop recording or playing a tape without warning and then shut itself off. Restarting the power ejects the tape; it's designed that way. You can't disable the auto rewind at tape's end either. Now the second deck had a front panel display, but it liked to take a bite out of the beginning of every tape it played, after the auto rewind.  On the positive side it outputs vhs and dvd to component and hdmi, which gives a more stable picture with digital tv's than using the old composite signal. The sound was good (hifi). Direct recording to dvd worked well, but I'm sure you can tell why I haven't dared to do any dubbing.  I have already SMASHED the deck that kept eating tapes. I am using the one with no display to try to make new vhs recordings and watch my existing tapes before it stops on its own. SHEEESH!  What an ordeal (and waste of money)!  So I am still looking for a vhs dvd recorder combo before they completely disappear.
