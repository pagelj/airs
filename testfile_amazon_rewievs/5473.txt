Sleek design, weak power.
Love the look of it. Powered on easily and installed quickly. Laptop got very hot to the touch very quickly, and it became apparent that the venting/cooling fans of the Cool Pad were not blowing much air at all. Kept it plugged in, LED is pretty (LOL), put your hand over the fans to feel the air current and there is nearly no air current at all. I guess I shouldn't expect much from such an inexpensive product.
