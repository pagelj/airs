Awesome Stand!
This stand is fantastic.  I bought it because I was on a bit of a budget and this was one of the cheapest clamp style dual monitor stands I could get.  Does way more than I would expect for the price.  Adjustable in basically every way you could need, both monitors tilt up/down, left/right, and can rotate completely around.  The entire thing is very well built, a solid product.  It's a bit weighty when loaded up so my cheap ikea desk bends a bit under the pressure, but that's most definitely a fault of the desk and not the stand.  I would recommend this to anyone that needs to get there monitors off their desk, having them raised up to eye level is very nice.
