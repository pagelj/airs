Incredible Read
Normally, I am not a fan of fictionalized Bible stories.  By and large I have found that although they are based on great truths and principles, to me they just don't seem very realistic.  I've never identified with the characters or hurt for them.  THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT.  Your heart will beat faster.  You will want to cry for these people.  You will be overjoyed to see them discover and re-discover God's amazing, redeming grace.  The editorial reviews do not do this book justice. This is one of those books that, when you finish the last chapter, you want to open it up and start all over again.  Loved it.
