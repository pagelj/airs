Awesome Gaming Laptop
Before all let me say sorry for my english (lol). This is the third Republic of gamers laptop i owned, and i gotta say ASUS is the best, i've never have any problem with their products. I update my laptop every 1 year and half or so, by that i mean i sell my current laptop and buy the lastest i can affort. I can tell the other 2 laptops from asus i sold still working perfectly not a single issue. Some people may think im an ASUS fanboy but i do some research before buying if i can find a laptop with better hardware for a lower price i might go with another brand. For example i see a lenovo with the same specs for about $1000, i bought this one for $1200 mainly because i know its a trusted brand and the cooling system is very good and very very silent. With this babe you can play the most recent games at decent settings here some examples of some games i tested:No Vsyng or AA in any of the games above. Dota 2 1080p max settings = 40-65 fpsMedal of honor Warfighter 1080p max settings = 27-33 fpsMaxPayne 3 1080p max settings = 35-40 fpsFar Cry 3 1080p custom settings everything on max except shadows on medium and posfxquality off = 26-34 fpsAs long as i get 28 fps+ im happy. For the record i have my gtx 660m OC @ +100, +300. Max temp i've ever reach 81Â°. In my case i dont like 17" laptops and my budged was $1200. So this laptop suite my needs. If you want a high end laptop, dont mind the size and have the money, go with alienware or clevo. Get a laptop with GTX 675M or GTX 680M (a beast). I will update this review later because i have a lot more to test.
