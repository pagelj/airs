Great camera .. kit lens doesn't sit tight enough!
So I was in love with my D90 for about 1 month, till the F-- error appeared!  This was very disappointing. I have found out that many people are having the same issue. Something wrong with the camera body/lens interface. How can you accept this on a $1200 camera?  Then I cleaned the contacts on the lens WITH MY THUMB!!! and that seemed to work great. It hasn't done the error since then. By the way, while this was going on, my 50mm f/1.8 nikkor lens was performing fine. When installed on camera, it feels like it sits tight unlike the kit lens. The camera scared me to death and therefore 4 stars .. but I'm back in love with it now!  Its a great camera. Edit (3/26/2012): After I got over the first few hiccups with this camera, it has worked flawlessly for years now. When it was in warranty, I had to send it back to Nikon for repair. But since then, it has been nothing but love to this camera. I got rid of all the lenses I had and replaced them with a 18-200 Nikon which I been very please with except for the weight/size. But it takes real good images. Edit (4/1/2013): Still working, still loving it!
