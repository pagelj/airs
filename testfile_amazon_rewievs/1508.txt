Good addition to my kit but quality still under testing
I use a Nikon and Zoom H1 for my video recordings. This mic is of course miles ahead of any camera mic but I'm still doing my testing as to the improvements (if any) over a mic like the Azden. The shock mount seems to work well enough but I find the coiled cord a little short.  I'm mounting my Zoom down below the camera and the cord pulls the shock mount to one side.  It's not enough to make pieces touch but it's still distracting enough to make you wonder if it will. My last recordings were of my kids concerts and the SPL was really high but this mic registered low and I had to turn the Zoom up to 70 to make it audible.  You can check out that video on youtube if you look for 'QA Choir Final' .
