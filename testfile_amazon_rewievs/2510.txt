SWEET!
Couldn't love this more!  Laser fast, and room for days!  Only thing I would have done differently after doing some reading was probably just buy 2 of the 32 gb cards.  And keep one in your bag for a just in case moment.  Never know when your card will become damaged or something, and you don't want to miss that next shot.  But this works just like it should, and I haven't ran out of room yet!
