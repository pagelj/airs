The toaster looks nice and it's compact, which is why I gave it two stars. However, form follows function, and this toaster didn't function!  Each side of toast did look even (just as the other reviews said) but the sides looked very different from one another.  One side of bread toasted quite a bit darker than the other side.  After one week of use, the toaster sparked and died. I must have received a lemon.
