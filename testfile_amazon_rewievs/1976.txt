Great bargain, great camera!
I got this camera as a backup for my Nikon D300, and I find myself using it even more than I expected.  It's more compact than the D300, has the same great low noise sensor, shoots at about the same frame rate in burst mode (although you can't attach the MB-D10, which upgrades my D300 to 8 frames per second) and has most of the same menu options as the D300.  Plus it has movie-making capabilities! Unfortunately, the moviemaking is not as good as it should be, so don't buy this camera just for that.  But for less than $1000, it's a great bargain for what you get. Image quality is wonderful, and it's easy to use.  This is a perfect camera for ambitious beginners or anyone who already has a D300 or who wants to upgrade from an older Nikon digital SLR camera.
