The prose is determinedly prosaic, the author's research practices are clearly inadequate, and the characters refuse to Use Their Words. The male lead is also an exemplar of the Wounded Emo Man with a Tragic Abusive Past. As an abuse survivor, I hate the trope and the inaccurate--damagingly so--portrayal of abuse survivors it promotes. A small sampling of errors: the protagonist's younger sister is named Samantha, a name originating in the US in the 19th century that will not become popular until 1873, while the book is set in the second decade of the 19th century). The protagonist's weapons training etc aside, there are a number of points at which it is obvious that the author doesn't understand period clothing or manners, and a few glaring malapropisms, including a horrible moment when the heroine is represented as having a place in the _bon mot_ (I cannot decide if the author is mistaking _bon ton_ or _beau monde_, but either way it's wrong--so, so, so wrong). Save yourself. That said, it's not the worst Regency I've read recently. It's just not very good.
