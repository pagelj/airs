very nice filters
I recently received these filters and was pleasantly surprised to see a polaroid name brand on the box. I'm simply an amatuer when it comes to using my newer Nikon camera but I did want something to protect the lens from dirt and scratches. This purchase does that and more for less than the same cost for one filter elsewhere. I've quickly tried these out (except for the flourescent filter) and noticed a significant difference in color with the polarized filter shooting outdoors. I just need to figure out the rotation of the glass while attached to the lens, I understand it affects the outcome of the pictures. I plan to use these regularly to compliment my pictures. They appear to be a solid material and for the price I don't think you can go wrong.
