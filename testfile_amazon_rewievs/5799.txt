Sony superzoom
Wanted a superzoom with Panorama mode so the choices are fairly limited.  This week both the Sony HX200V and Nikon P510 came out so bought them both to compare.  The first review by "techguy" gives some nice details about the camera so I won't repeat his comments.  I've played with them now for a couple of days and do not claim to be an expert by any means so take these comments with a grain of salt.  These are just initial impressions. I found overall the Sony took nicer pictures than the Nikon which tended to give a slight yellow hue on grass.  And when enlarging the pictures the detail was better.  The Sony produced slightly clearer pics both indoors and out and skins tones were a little warmer and more natural.  The Sony also allows you to adjust the color and vividness to personal taste, don't believe the Nikon allowed for this. I did like the size and feel of the Nikon better, the menu was a little more user friendly I thought and so was the layout of buttons.  Start up time was about equal, although be aware with the Nikon if you choose to have it display the "Coolpix" icon it delays this by a couple of seconds. One feature I found very useful is the Sony tells you how much time remains in minutes, not just a bar graph, I hate running out of power unexpectedly.  Biggest gripe so far with the Sony is the power cord/charger. It's nearly as big as my laptop charger.  Wish they would do it like Nikon or Panasonic.  I travel on a motorcycle and space is very limited so this is a pain. Sony puts the Panorama mode on the top dial while Nikon buries it with the Scene mode and the view finder turns on automatically if you put your eye to it, both thoughtful touches.  I really wanted to like the Nikon more, mainly due to the better charger layout but in the end, good pictures is what it all about so the Nikon will be going back.
