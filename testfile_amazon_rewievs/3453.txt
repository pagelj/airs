Intriguing
An intriguing story combining romance, lust for power, determination to survive and betrayal both in modern and ancient times.  The settings in both modern and ancient Egypt are well realized and the plot keeps you turning the pages.  A few of the minor characters seemed a little flimsy but still an enjoyable read.
