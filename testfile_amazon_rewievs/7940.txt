Good reliable phone
Having owned this phone for quite a long time now, I will say that this phone has been a very reliable phone for me.  It has held up from the drops and oops and still keeps going strong.  The biggest disadvantage today for this phone is that you are limited to what version of Android your carrier decides to stop at before no longer upgrading.  It is well capable of handling the later versions of the android operating system but unfortunately for me, my carrier has discontinued android OS updates at 2.3.  But if you are willing to live with that then this phone is a good reliable choice.  Battery life is good but like most batteries these days, they start to dwindle in lifespan after a couple years and you are stuck at either upgrading or spending a premium for Motorola's replacement battery. This phone does it all well and in my opinion works better than an Iphone.
