Great Oven
We are well satisfied eith the Oven. Shipping was prompt. There are two issues that we have. The oven does not sit level and the right front must be shimmed to stop the tilt. it is not severe but is annoying. We wish that the crumb tray were accessable from the front rather than the rear. Overall we are well pleased.
