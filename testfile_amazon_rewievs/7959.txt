Hilarious and romantic!
This is my first book by this author, but it will not be my last. This book was funny, realistic and romantic. The story lines for all the main characters fit well together. Richard's a total weasel and Des is a true hero. I could have done with less of Sadie's hang ups, but I guess after 8 years of emotional abuse, it's realistic. This book is a keeper.
