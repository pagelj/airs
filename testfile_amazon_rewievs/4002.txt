Smelled Funny
It fits my phone well, but it smells so weird I can't even use it. It's like really strongly perfumed or something, and it makes my head hurt to have it be anywhere near me.  The smell transferred to my hands too, and even after washing the case with mild soap and water. I had it on my phone for a total of 10 minutes before I had to take it off and put it somewhere in a well-ventilated area.
