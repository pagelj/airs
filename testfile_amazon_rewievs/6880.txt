I was quite happy upon assembly and first use of this reasonably well-designed, convenient, and economically priced vacuum, which would have been fine for my small condo had it kept working. Unfortunately, the belt broke 10 minutes into its first use and one would have to wonder at the overall quality of the rest of the unit if its components are that shoddy. OK, belts are cheap but not sold by Amazon so I am now waiting 3-5 days to be able to try again. The unit should come with at least one extra belt. I am not confident about the long-term prospects and would not recommend it for anything other than occasional or light use.
