Don't buy this coffee maker! I had one for about 4 months and then I woke up to boiling coffee and smoke everywhere. The coffee pot had caught fire on the inside! I called Cuisinart and the customer service was great. I had a replacement in a day. Now, a year later, this one caught on fire! Avoid this model at all cost!!!!
