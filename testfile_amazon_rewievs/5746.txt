Good value
Don't be fooled by that you need gold-plated wire for a good cable!  They're metal and they conduct electricity over a fairly short distance?  Sheesh, you could probably get away with a coat hanger if it had the right connector on it.  But lacking that, you will be more than happy with these HDMI cables.
