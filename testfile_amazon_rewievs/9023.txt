Works great, wifi setup easy and simple.
I took the wires and put them in their respective slots and holes, i turned it on and went through the simple straight forward setup, and before i knew it i was no longer stuck watching netflix on my computer, finally i can give growing hemorrhoids sitting in a computer chair for endless hours a break and finally break into the field of complete leg muscle atrophy. my future is really taking a turn upwards.
