Perhaps for a target audience but excellent when it hits the mark.
Being born in 1976 and being a technophile for the duration I fit the target audience of this book to a T.  When he describes the various 80's pop references I watched, read and listened to all of them.  Same with all of the various arcade, console and microcomputer games.  I played Zork, Galaga and Joust and Ms Pacman etc.  I am just disappointed there was no reference to the Ultima series but i suspect I know why. Fast forward to today and I am familiar with the MMO market and all that entails.  In short, I am about as suited to understand and appreciate this book as is possible.  In no small way did the subject matter resonate with me and in that it worked. As an engineer by trade, my literary analysis is somewhat limited.  I found the characters compelling, the plot over the top but what did you really expect, I like the pacing in that I was not cutting ahead as I often find myself doing because I am bored with how we are getting there, and the narrative truly did immerse me as I imagine teh author might appreciate. That being said, I do not know how someone who is not me will take it.  When he describes going into the Zork setting for example.  I played that game so I can fill in those gaps so to speak.  I do not know how that would crossover for someone else.  I liked it a whole hell of a lot though so take that for what it is worth.
