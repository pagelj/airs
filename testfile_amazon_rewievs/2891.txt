dissapointed
I purchased this item for a friend for christmas.  After 10 minutes of use in her video camera, the card read full.  She removed the card and reinserted it into the camera with the same result.  I am very dissapointed with this product.  She returned it to me and I attempted to return it to Amazon, only to learn that I only had about 14 days to return.  $43 dollars down the drain.
