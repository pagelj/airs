Odd series has us cheering for the bad guys
This is a well acted and interesting series from the SyFi channel that puts the viewer in the very strange (and in my case, uncomfortable) position  of having to root for the bad guy. The Series begins with a group of ex-military members turned freedom fighters in 2077 that get time warped back to 2012. In their time our and all democratic governments have been taken over by corporations that institute an oligarchy of sorts and with the use of a Gestapo style police force keep citizens in check. The rebels are an elite military force fighting the corporate takeover of our lives and government  and yet because the show devotes little time to their reasoning or aspirations the terrible acts of violence they perpetrate are mainly seen as evil. In the meantime the main character, Kiera, is an agent of this repressive police force who by luck finds in our time the help of a young self centered (maybe narcissistic) computer genius who ironically in the future will be the head of one of those fascist corporations that rule us. Together they manage to use our current 2012 time law enforcement to Kiera's advantage  and to keep from them the fact that her mission is, if she manages to stop the rebels,  in fact the breakdown and fall of our current society. The main rub of it all, is that while we follow Kiera through the series, we find out she is at her core a good person, mother and wife who longs to get back to her family in the future. So despite her ultimately evil and destructive goal it is hard not to feel or even cheer for her. I will keep watching the show with interest despite the disturbing apologist view of a rosy  tinted corporate takeover of our freedoms. It has the potential to explore these sociological themes and hope it does not devolve into just another run of the mill cop show even if it's one that has the bad guy as the good guy just to be different.
