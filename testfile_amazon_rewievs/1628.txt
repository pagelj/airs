A Very Fine Camera For So Little Money
I had never owned a digital camera before and wanted to start with a Point-and-Shoot camera. I bought this Kodak C1550 model on Amazon used for only $40.00 + a few more dollars for a 4GB memory card. I was shocked that it is only the size of a pack of cigarettes! It is very easy to take high quality pictures and just as easy to transfer the images to your home computer. The computer program then asks you if you would like to delete the images out of your camera as a convenience. I like that. All you do is connect the USB cable from your computer to the connection jack on the right side of the camera and the images are automatically copied into the "pictures" folder on your home computer. It couldn't be simpler. The video display on the rear of the camera is a large three inch screen. The camera has other capabilities I may never use, but it's good to know those features are there for the future. Highly recommended.
