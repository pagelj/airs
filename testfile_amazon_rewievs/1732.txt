Good but pricey and model specific
This is a great product. I will not speak much about its capacity to hold charge since alot of reviewers mentioned that. I have no problem with the charge since i do not take that many pictures anyway. But I believe it is a great product but a little pricey. My main problem however, is that i was forced to buy a new battery since this Canon EOS 5D Mark II is not compatible with any of the accessories from the older Canon EOS 5D which I also own.
