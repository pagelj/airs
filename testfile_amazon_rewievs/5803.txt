Harry Rocks
I've been a Dresden fan for years, having read the books by Jim Butcher and a couple of short stories.  To say that I was thrilled that SciFi made the series is being mild.  While there are inconsistencies in the show, (Lt. Murphy in the book is blonde and her first name is Karryn, while on TV she is a brunette, Hispanic named Connie to mention  but one), they have not yet been overly irksome.  Paul Blackthorne does a great job of portraying Harry's self-dreprecating self of humor and is close to my mental image of Harry that I've formed over the years.  I think the series will continue to build a fan base, if SciFi gives it a chance, and could lead into a big-screen version of one of the novels!  I truly hope that SciFi gives this show a chance to flourish as they have other programs.  The Dresden Files is an intellectual program that requires its viewers to think while they are enjoying the show.  Television at large is almost bereft of shows with these qualities!
