very very happy!
tried all sorts of recipies on it from grilled chicken wings, bacon, fish , steak and eggs.. all turned out delicious! very happy with grill and fortunately maybe after lessons learned in customer images, maybe cuisnart took the hint about side tabs as mine arrived with metal tabs at side... worth its money in gold..
