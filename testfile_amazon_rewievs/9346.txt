Solid case, with questionable zipper placement
This case does a fine job of protecting my laptop. I leave it in my bag all the time, and just remove the laptop directly from the sleeve while still in the bag. I feel like I have to be careful every time though, because the zippers can occasionally come in contact with the surface of the Macbook when sliding it in or out, and I'm worried about scratching it.
