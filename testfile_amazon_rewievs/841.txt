Just Blah
It's not a bad book.  It's not a great book.  The pace of events is far too fast for my liking. Everything happens in such a flurry of events it's very unrealistic.  The dialogue is stock.  The characters are stock.  Nothing about this book is new, inventive or creative.  It's just a collection of cliches and overused themes.
