WOW!
I'm so blown away by The Martian I hardly know what to write!  Astronaut stranded on Mars, my first thought was "OK, Martians reveal their existance and somehow save him."  But it's not like that at all.  It's a hugely engrossing and highly detailed account of how the astronaut survives and gets back to earth.  Although I struggled a bit with all the detail, I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended!
