reminds me of the Prodigy years - Bad content client
Got this unit because it was rated top in the Consumer Reports. The Web interface is horrendous. The screens reminded me of the Prodigy years. Those of you old enough, you will know what I am referring to. It is built to sell subscriptions, i. e., entice you to sign up with pay-for-viewing services. Does not play back AVI and MKV files [see update below]. Came with an RCA (analog) set of cables. LG should have either included HDMI cables or skip them altogether. So far has hanged up twice and required three firmware updates. September 29, 2012 UPDATEContacted LG's tech support about the AVI and MKV incompatibility. After they insisted it should be able to play them, I experimented with different file sizes. Looks like the unit can play files up to 1 gigabyte but will not recognize anything bigger than that. Also, the unit hangs up when pointed to a DLNA server with thousands of pictures loaded. The only way to reset it is unplugging it from the wall. In short, the unit may be fine as a basic Bluray player or for any PURCHASED services over the Web. When it comes to accessing your local multimedia content, it is a different and sad story.
