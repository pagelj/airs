Bad Bad Bad
I received my 2nd heart in the mail to find the same problem as the first, defective!!  It was packaged this time in padding, but the seam on the heart is broken and all the beads are coming out of it.  So far 1 out of 3 have been good?? We were bummed when we got this one, because we really needed it.  Can someone PLEASE look at one before they send me a new one to make sure it is ok?? ThanksBrad
