Great Cable, Arrived Quickly
HDMI cables in general are a commodity item.  Many people get ripped off when buying these things at big box stores.  Many people figure that if they are buying a TV for $1000 then it is not a problem to buy a "premium" HDMI cable for $35.  Do yourself a favor and get this one.  It sends a perfect digital signal and I really have no complaints about it.  One tiny thing I don't like (but really is not a big deal) is that the "head" of the cable is a little bigger than I expected. Be patient and wait a day or two for this to come in the mail.  It will save you big money and works really well!
