I bought this tiny vacuum for my tiny room to clean up the hair from my tiny cat. It picks up A LOT more than you can see on your carpet, but the downside to this is that the suction gets reduce dramatically if you don't clear out the filter after a few square feet. Buy if you need for pet hair. Buy it if you need a good, small vacuum. Highly recommend it.
