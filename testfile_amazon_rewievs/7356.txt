Chums Waterproof Camera Float
Well made and feels comfortable on my wrist. Keeps the point and shoot on the surface and highly visible. no issue with tearing away from the camera. very secure. the float part can be removed from the part attached to the camera by a clasp. sturdy and didn't come apart on its own. Worth it.
