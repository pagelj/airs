Fahrenheit 451
The book talked about important themes that changed my perspective on life. Guy Montag's world was nothing but bizarre rules that covered up the past. One important part of the story was the fear of change. The society was against him for his attempt to find out the truth. Killing his fellow firefighter, Beatty, caused him to see that he wanted to die. Quote: "... In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there joking, needling, thought Montag, and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air."  He wanted to be free, instead of being confined within rules of the ordinary.
