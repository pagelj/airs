Using it for my PS3
I threw in this cable between my PS3 and my 26" Vizio and it looks absolutely amazing. Definitely a step up from from 480p. You would be crazy to buy a retail HDMI at 30-40 bucks or higher, when you can just get these guys for a little over 2 bucks. The cord used for this seems slightly cheap, yet sturdy to me; but I'm not an expert on cables so that's probably just me. :PAs far as the shipping went, it came in on the last day of the estimated time.
