GREAT wallmount for the price!
This video is Showing my LG 47" 3d LED tv mounted on this videosecu wall mount. Showing the clearance between the wall and the connections. It is very sleek and slim. But very sturdy also. My friend bought him a wall mount locally for $80 and there is no difference. Setup up was very easy. Took less than 30 minutes to assemble and find the wall studs. Mind you this is my first time installing a wall mount. GREAT GREAT GREAT wall mount!
