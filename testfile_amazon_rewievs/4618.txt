Neoprene sleve for my Canon 60S with a Tamoron lense 18-270
The sleeve was a perfect fit for my camera . I was a bit worried about it being to small, as most of the reviews stated that the sleeve was fitting very tight. I had no problem at all, especially with my lens, it fit perfectly. I like to stick my camera in my purse, rather than using a camera bag, as a purse is more than I want to carry. With the sleeve, I no longer have to worry about my camera getting scratched up. I was also amazed at how easy it is to take my camera in and out of the sleeve, as I'm all about easy or forget it. Don't want to miss that picture perfect moment. I say ignore the negative reviews and buy it! I didn't have any contact with the vendor, other than ordering it on line, and waiting for it to arrive. It took about a week to arrive. Wish it could've been the two day Amazon delivery. Other than the weight, I'm totally satisfied!
