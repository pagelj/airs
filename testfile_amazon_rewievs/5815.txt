Great value for the novice photog
A great product for those of us who don't want to spend $300 or more on a lens to experiment with. Sharpness with this lens is its best attribute, as well as its size - makes a great lens to cut down on the weight when traveling or hiking. I recently took it on a trip to a wedding and I was able to capture some truly beautiful images that pleased the bride, groom (who is a professional photographer) and the family as well. Some reviewers complain about it being made from plastic. It's a $100 lens, and to get Canon quality at this price, I say "quit your complaining people." Unless you have a bad habit of dropping your lenses and running into walls (in which case, you should be using disposable cameras instead of a DSLR), this will do wonderfully for you. If you're just wanting to experiment and expand your lens collection without taking out a second mortgage, buy this lens. You will not be disappointed.
