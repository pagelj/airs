Not so great in dark scenarios!!!! but a ok camera for evrething else
I take this camera to a birthday party held at night indoors and where there where no proper light (considered it was a disco), and i wasnt able to take more than 3 or 4 and a bunch of dark picture that i have to erased, this was and embarresment comparing to other picture taked by other camera  with less pixel that delivered good quality picture of the birthday. Overall, at daylight and indoors with good ilumination, this camera do a decent jobs to capture those precious moment. if you have money for other camera, you may want to pass this one, but if you want a decent camera that in good conditions do the job and if you loss it or break it  you dont going to fell  sorry, go ahead and buy it.
