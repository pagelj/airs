No regrets!
I've been looking for an electric sharpener for quite awhile. After looking around, I came across a very interesting review from  Jason Dugas "j lance". So i thought,".. what the heck,just go for it". Thanks to prime membership, got it in two days. Boy, Jason was right. I was smiling from ear to ear, provided with a couple of practice runs. Cheers to Jason for convincing me.
