This is our second pot of this type and we got it for a backup.  The thing I like about it is that is does not have that infernal automatic cut off after 90 minutes.  I hooked it up to an external timer and it goes off and on when I want it to.  However, the most important part is that it makes a really good cup of coffee.  This is a very good buy.
