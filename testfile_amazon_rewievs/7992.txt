You are not in Kansas anymore, you are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen, respect that fact every second of every day
I suppose that by now, everyone who is even remotely interested has either seen Avatar or heard about it, so I will dispense with the synopsis or any run down of the plot. I just have a few things to say about Avatar, Director James Cameron (self-proclaimed "King of the World"), the true worth of Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and the lovely and vivacious Zoë Saldana.-----------------Selfridge: This is why we're here: because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo.====================First, Avatar deserves every bit of its popularity and massive box office. It had the dazzling special effects, thrilling action, and steamy romance of the blockbuster, but it also had thought provoking concepts, a subversive political message, and compelling characters and story. When director James Cameron won the Oscar for Titanic, and Titanic won for best picture, I cringed--especially when he quoted Leonardo DiCaprio's line "I'm the King of the World!" It was adding insult to injury--rubbing salt in the wound. Not that Titanic was a bad film, it was just that it seemed like it swept all the awards except for acting and writing--as if those contributions no longer mattered. You could have a best film without the best acting or writing. I confess I felt a backlash to all the success it garnered, and I wanted it to lose. I don't care for Celine Dion, either, though I do admit that she has monumental pipes and can really belt out a tune. Perhaps I am a pretentious snob who looks down on anything that achieves such mass popularity (don't answer that)? But I do try to keep an open mind, and Avatar really won me over. I would have been happy to see it win either Best Film or Best Director. I didn't see The Hurt Locker, but if James Cameron and Avatar had to lose, that seems like the best alternate choice. First woman director, and Cameron's ex-girlfriend? James Cameron seemed very gracious about losing to her, and I find it very easy to forgive his hubris about Titanic now.------------Dr. Grace Augustine: [to Jake, just before he connects to his Avatar] Just relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldn't be too hard for you.==================Avatar did something very difficult to do, and that is, it made you feel more connected to the blue people of Pandora then you did to your fellow earthlings. It was like a Western where you were rooting for the Native Americans to triumph over the cowboys. The tree huggers instead of the loggers. You rooted for the Marines--to lose! And it appealed to the masses. The Avatar concept no doubt helped, as when Jake Sully connected to his Avatar you saw the world through the eyes of the Na'vi.------------Jake Sully: Everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.===============Sam Worthington was a really good choice to play Jake Sully. While channel surfing I briefly watched a segment on a sleazy papparazzi show like TMZ and the 'photo journalists' had nothing but good things to say about Sam. He was very down-to-earth, and humble about his recent good luck in starring in two major blockbusters: Clash of the Titans, and Avatar. Before his big break I saw him in an Australian film called Somersault that fans of the young Mr. Worthington might find interesting. In Avatar he brings a lot to the quest of Jake to become a "taronyu," or hunter, even if it was done with mostly motion capture, CGI, and blue screen. He's no skxawng.------------------Neytiri: To become "taronyu", hunter, you must choose your own Ikran and he must also choose you. Jake Sully: When? Neytiri: When you are ready.========================Zoë Saldana, as the Na'vi woman Neytiri, also does a great job of acting that shows through all the special effects. She is a very intense actress, and also an extremely beautiful one. She is Nyota Uhura in the new Star Trek! Michelle Rodriguez, Sigourney Weaver, Giovanni Ribisi, and Stephen Lang as the quarrelsome Colonel Quaritch really made Avatar work. The Bottom Line is Avatar is a game changing milestone in the history of cinema. Great special effects and dazzling 3D, yet it didn't sacrifice characters or narrative on their unholy altar. I loved the scenes of Jake and the Na'vi warriors riding through the sky on their Ikrans. And Sam Worthington and Zoë Saldana are the cutest blue couple since Di Caprio and Winslet froze.---------Neytiri: You are Omaticaya now. You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree. And you may choose a woman. We have many fine women. Ninat is the best singer. Jake Sully: I don't want Ninat. Neytiri: Peyral is a good hunter. Jake Sully: Yes, she is a good hunter. But I've already chosen. But this woman must also choose me. Neytiri: [smiles] She already has.[They kiss]================Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition) (2009) Zoë Saldana was Nyota UhuraVantage Point (Single-Disc Edition) (2008) Sigourney Weaver was Rex Brooks and Zoë Saldana was Angie JonesSomersault (2004) Sam Worthington was JoeMasked and Anonymous (2003) Giovanni Ribisi was SoldierBlue Crush (Widescreen Collector's Edition) (2002) Michelle Rodriguez was EdenBoiler Room (2000) Giovanni Ribisi was Seth DavisLost Highway (1997) Giovanni Ribisi was Steve 'V'Last Exit to Brooklyn [VHS] (1989) Stephen Lang was Harry BlackAlien (The Director's Cut) (1979) Sigourney Weaver was RipleyAnnie Hall (1977) Sigourney Weaver was Alvy's Date Outside Theatre------------Col.
