Does not work for Samsung Galaxy S2
This worked great in my computer and transferred/stored files extremely quickly. My iPod was stolen and I wanted to transfer the songs from one old laptop to my new one with the ultimate goal of storing the music on my Samsung Galaxy S2. However, this card doesn't work with the Sprint Samsung Galaxy S2 (SPH-D710). Galaxy S2 phones can't read SDXC cards and after a few failed attempts at formatting the card so that it WOULD work, gave up. Further reading seemed to indicate that correctly formatting the card would halve its storage anyway, so why pay for the 64 gb card? If you have a Galaxy S3 or S4, this card should work perfectly in your phone. Not part of rating: This company's 32 gb microSDHC does work in the Galaxy S2 and so far it's working great.
