Mismatching Vertical Brackets!!
I have to say everything was great until I went to hang my TV on the wall. I noticed every time I hung it that it was tilted to one side. After 3 attempts checking to see if the wall plate was level I noticed that the actual vertical brackets were completely different. One was bigger than the other completely different machining types. Because I had 4 holes in the wall and a broken stand, I was forced to hang my 47" plasma (soon to be LED) with mismatching parts. So it is technically hanging on two good screws on one side and one screw on the other as the lower end of this bracket can't reach the screw hole on my TV by about 3 inches. If nothing comes about this review I will have to purchase another one of these and hope that the larger of the two come in the next package. I have a couple of photos if any one wants them. Otherwise, for 30 bucks I got a new magnetic leveler, a HDMI cable (which I needed), and a pretty sturdy wall mount. I am sure this was just a manufacturing line mistake. Hopefully, if the manufactures read these they will jump in and help out. Thanks for reading.
