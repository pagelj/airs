I absolutely love this machine. It takes more than one priming but after that taste is gone, it gives an excellent cup of coffee. I had the small keurig but wanted the convenience of not having to put water in the coffee maker every time I wanted to make a cup of coffee. It also brews small cups, medium and large cups which I could not do with the one I had. Iced coffee is also an option now.
