Nice Case
I love the size and construction of this case.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't like the way it unzips.  It seems to be backwards to me since the top flap opens from the back of the case to the front of the case.  I would prefer it open from the front to the back ... but that's my preference.  I don't know if that matters much as long as it meets my needs and is constructed well.  And I paid $10 less on Amazon :)
