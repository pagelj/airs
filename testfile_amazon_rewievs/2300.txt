This machine is great.  In my opinion any decent Espresso works well, unless you are an Espresso snob. I have tried them all, and I will tell you that the Cuban Espresso hits a home run all the time, and it is usually lower priced than the well known brands.  I have been drinking Espresso since I was a child.  Coming from a very Italian family, Demi Tasse, as it was know back in  the day, was the after dinner beverage, and Medaglia Doro was the star. This machine handles any brand quite well.
