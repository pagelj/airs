Tastey, but very sugary. Not for those trying to lose weight type of snacks.
It doesn't taste like it has loads of sugar. Then I checked the label and EACH pastry has 19 grams of sugar. If you sit there and eat the whole bag, it's 38 grams of sugar and 410 calories combined. That's meal worthy, not a snack. It tastes very good. I didn't buy this at amazon, but at my university because I needed a snack and saw this was organic and it was very cheap. It costs 99cents plus tax for 2 pastries. I was shocked since the university jacks up the price of everything. I wouldn't consider buying these if you want to lose weight and get a snack in the mean time. Just too much sugar for something organic. Though in a way it isn't meant to be a health food, it's just made out of organic things. But if you are trying to lose weight and want a healthy snack, this isn't it. These tastes more fruitful than poptarts.
