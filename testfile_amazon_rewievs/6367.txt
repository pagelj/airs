Delightful Story
I received a copy of Penelope from the author who liked my review of her other book.  I love romance and this book certainly has romance.  Madcap is the correct word for this book. Penelope comes to England to "come out" to society in order to find a husband.  She arrives with Lady Bathsheba, her goat in tow.  Her first day does not go well because she is given brandy and then wine and gets drunk.  Strange things happen to her throughout the book. This book is such an enjoyable read.  All the characters are well described.  If Jimmy, the highwayman, had not been in love with his wife, I think he could have fallen in love with Penelope as much as everyone else did except for the Duke's fiancee. How can you not love a character who feels strange when the Duke sees her wearing almost nothing because the modeste needed to see her figure.  Madame Bellafraude, the modeste, teaches Penelope many things including keeping secrets. I look forward to reading more of Ms. Wylde's works in the future.
