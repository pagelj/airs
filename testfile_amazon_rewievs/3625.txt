Great bag!
This bag is very comfortable to wear.  Strap can be worn over left or right shoulder.  There are lots of compartments.  The top compartment is very easy and quick to access anything. I love the side pockets - water bottle on one side, snacks on the other.  It is easy to grab what I need from this bag, as long as I remember which pocket I put it in.  The only thing I don't love is the Velcro pocket on the shoulder strap that is in front of you when you have the bag on.  It's for a cell phone maybe?  It's not very big, but it does not seem very secure and kind of sticks out and flops forward.  I wouldn't feel comfortable putting something important in it because it seems like it could get ripped off of the shoulder strap easily.  It's not a big deal though, you can just pull the pocket off if you don't want it there.  I haven't had this bag very long, nor does it get heavy use, but it's a great bag to keep my stuff handy and grab as I walk out the door.  I would recommend this bag to others.
