No more leftover partial cups of coffee to reheat!  I love the convenience of precisely one cup (either size) without the expense, storage, and extra trash/recycling of premeasured plastic cups.  This is easy to set up and brews fast.  Cleaning is a snap too (and no glass pot to worry about breaking)... just a quick rinse and it's ready for the next cup.
