just what I need
The canon deluxe photo backpack 200EG is what I was looking for my new canon xsi. The movable compartments are good for organizing the extra lens I have which is a 55-250 lens. As well as lens covers, wipes, ect... I still have room for more lenses. I have added extra elastic straps with velcro to help hold my camera in place. The interior see through compartments are good for cords, extra battery & charger as well as other items that I might need. The 1st outer compartment I use for my user manual and other paperwork. The 2nd outer compartment is empty for now, but I put snacks in it. The padded shoulder straps and back make it comfortable for bike riding. The cross body strap also helps to keep the pack from shifting side to side when riding a bike.
