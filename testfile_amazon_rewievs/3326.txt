Love the backpack!
I have a Macbook and there is plenty of room for it, along with a few books.  Lots of pockets and places for all of you stuff.  The construction materials are more rugged than any bag I have ever had.  Besides that the all black back looks great.  Well worth the $35 I paid at Amazon!
