Buggy product
I bought this Macbook Air because of recommendation from friends. However, first day the laptop could not connect to my home wireless network. I have tried at my work place, my friend home; but nothing seemed to work. I brought the laptop to apple store for service. After the service, I could connect to the wireless network after that service; but web page freeze all the time. My iPad which also used the same wireless network had no issue at all. I had also try again at work place, and friend home. The web page and app store  still freezing. I had to brought the laptop back to apple store for sevice again.
