"  I cannot say enough for this vacuum.  I was looking for a cordless for my wood floors andthe 'Electrolux Pronto 2-in-1' cordless vacuum that I owned for 6 years just didn't function well anymorebecause the old and worn-out battery could not be replaced unless I purchased a new hand unit. After purchasing the 'Hoover Lynx' cordless, I find that it is twice as powerful as my old one. It is almost like using a full electric vacuum cleaner. I AM THRILLED WITH THIS CORDLESS. I was able to vacuum 1000 sq ft until the battery finally died out.  However, I did purchasean extra battery and so I exchanged them out to finish the vacuuming.  It also comes with abattery charger so you do not have to leave the vacuum itself plugged into a wall socket as I had to do with the Electrolux. There are 2 settings: wood floors and rugs/carpet.  The rugs/carpet setting works really well. I had absolutely no problem getting my rugs clean. The suction is very powerful.  Emptying the dirt cup was simple and dirt-free. I do want to mention that when using the wood floors setting,it is not easy to reach into the corners, so keep that in mind, but other than than, I would not give this cordless up for any other. If you are looking for an exceptional cordless for your wood floors and rugs, look no further. But, be sure to purchase the extra battery, especially if you have over 800 square feet of living space.  "
