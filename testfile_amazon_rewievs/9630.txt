I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.
