I had such high hopes for this machine.  I am a big espresso drinker.  I used to own an old hand pump machine but it was damaged. I bought this not thinking I would get a great espresso but at least a decent one.  This produced a horrible espresso.  I tired to learn the machine and compensate for its weaknesses but it did not matter.  I never even got an espresso that I would of considered average.  Espresso machine was a major disappointmentThe coffee was the same, I couldn't figure it out, it never brewed a good cup.  I came out with a routine, 2 16oz bottles of cold filtered water and an exact measure of coffee.  Pretty much the exact amount every time.  The coffee was bearable but for some reason it was never consistent, even though nothing changed.  My wife on the other hand could not use it, and went to dunkin donuts everyday.  The coffee maker, was a disappointment as well as you had to walk a tight rope to get a decent cup from it. I got a free Gevalia machine when I agreed to buy some coffee which was a good deal.  Then my wife got a Keurig which is convenient but the coffee is bland and watered down. Brewing pots with a machine is the cheaper way to go by far.  Small 4 to 6 cup pots yield the best flavor.  I would recommend if you thinking of Keurig, don't go that road.  Check out the Flavia machine, the coffee is 10x's better and it consistent, you always great the same great cup everytime, never watered down.  Its just as good a brewing a pot the old fasioned way.
