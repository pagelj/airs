Satisfied all I wanted
I bought this case to carry a couple ipads, an ipad keyboard, all the accessories for an ipad plus maybe some person papers or stuff. It fits the bill perfectly and I do not have to squeeze anything in. It is smaller than a regular briefcase and, of course, lighter (depending on what you load into it). It is decently padded - fell out of car and no damage to items. Zipper pulls are easy to grasp. Main compartment has two way zipper. Study connecting shoulder strap. Fabric would really have to be hooked or gouged to tear. Has nice hand grips if you choose not to use shoulder strap. This case is perfect for what I wanted it for and the price was reasonable. I expect many years of use.
