Great product!
Easy to install and all functions of my iPhone 4 are fully operational. Only (small)issue is the hole for headphone jack does not line up with the jack. Not even close. But there is a little flap that opens up to allow use, so it doesn't really cause any problem. Clip-on holster is a bit bulky and does not feel secure when clipped on. I seldom use it for that reason.
