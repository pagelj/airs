Surprisingly Good!
I bought this lens with low expectations as far as image quality. I wanted some extra range and can't yet afford the 70-200mm. I got a Canon 7D for my birthday last week and really needed a zoom lens. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at the image quality of this lens. The brightness also surprised me. I have a 17-55mm f2.8 walk around lens and a 50mm f1.4 prime, so I was used to being able to shoot in low light conditions w/o much worry. This lens, at f4 really does pretty good. I took it out to the the park at night with my tripod and I have to say, for the money, you really can't go wrong. If you need some extra reach at an affordable price, this lens should be on your short list.
