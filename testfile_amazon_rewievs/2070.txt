Truthfulness for yesterday, today, and tomorrow
As an English teacher who uses this novel in a high school class I may be accused of being biased but this novel is one of the most chilling and prophetic novels ever written. I will agree with some readers that  Bradbury's writing style may be lacking but should readers choose to focus  on the minor details instead of considering the themes which he addresses  then they are sorely missing out on a wonderful experience. With each new  reading of this novel, I discover new aspects and facets which mirrors our  society in this country and throughout the world. Analyze the novel while  looking deep into the problems of our country alone and a reader cannot  help but be moved. This book isn't crying to save all books. It goes far  beyond that. It examines the power that people have in shaping their  culture, their future and their history. What is freedom and at what price  do we preserve every single person's individual rights? Is the power in the  society, or the individual? Thank you Mr. Bradbury for providing us with  such a wonderful tale.
