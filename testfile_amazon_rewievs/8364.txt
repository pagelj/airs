The best book I have ever read!!!!!!
Wow! I am hooked on Francine Rivers! After starting with The Atonement  Child, I haven't been able to stop reading her stuff! This is the most  incredible book ever! Michael's love is so consuming that it melts and  creates an equal fire in Sarah, so much so that she is willing to give him  up because she thinks it's best. I could not put this book down, I read it  from 7 to 1:30 one night. Amazon has the best prices by far--this book is  worth way more than what it costs!
