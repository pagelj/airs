Easy to use
I have a 2002 Silverado and this thing works great! The only issue I have is if I'm on a pretty bumpy ride, it slips a little out of the cd slot. Also, I just got a new phone and the sides block the volume toggle, but it is what it is. I would suggest this if you have a high sitting cd slot.
