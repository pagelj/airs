We have 2 dogs and researched vacuums to pick up pet hair.  Based on the avalanche of positive reviews on sites like this, we settled on the Shark.  It performed adequately in spite of design issues such as:  dirt collection cup too small; long hose so heavy that extending it pulls vacuum over and sends it crashing to the floor; air circulating out of the vacuum exits at the front of machine and is directed downward at the floor, blowing dirt and dust away from the machine so you cannot capture it without chasing it up against a solid surface!  We overlooked these problems because the Shark did a good enough job sucking up the pet hair..... UNTIL last week, when the beater bar stopped working.  A trip to the vacuum cleaner repair shop revealed that the engine was burned out and it would cost as much to fix it as a whole new machine!  Repairman called it "an electric broom" implying he sees more than a few of these with burned out motors.  We did not use it recklessly or to excess--normal apartment housekeeping use.  It lasted about 1 year.  WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS VACUUM.
