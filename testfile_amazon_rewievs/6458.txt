X-Men: Vintage edition
Let me tell you a secret, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is actually Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Yes, the book tries to pretend it is something else, embellishing itself with creepy and weird vintage photographs, but the reality is, it is nothing more than a regurgitated version of X-Men. Rarely do I come across a book that is as far from what it aspires to be as this one. You might expect "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" to be a mysterious, deranged, quirky, horror-filled tale, but it just isn't. The novel was clearly written around a collection of peculiar and unsettling photos, but the narrative never reaches the level of creepy of the visual materials it relies on. Instead, it is a mediocre at best book that should have had 10-year old as its characters instead of teens. And instead of artsy, angst-filled photographs, it should have had more appropriate pencil illustrations to go with its Monster-is-going-to EAT-you! BOO! plot. You don't believe me it's bad? Try reading the book or, better yet, listen to the audio version of it without the visual aid of the photos. See what you think of the writing then. The photos are worth looking at though.
