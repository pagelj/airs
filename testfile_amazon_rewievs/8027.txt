Gorgeous Tote!
I just got this great tote! This tote is very well made and so much nicer than I expected. The quality is quite good. The stitching is tight and not a single seam out of line, or even a tiny frayed end. I was very impressed. The dye used to color the bag was a bit heavy when I first opened the bag, but it quickly disappeared. I love it. It's not heavy, it's beautiful, and it holds all my stuff. I really like it and carry it everyday!
