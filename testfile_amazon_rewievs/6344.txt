it seems difficult to change the screen saver setting
Over all the chromebook works well for the past week. One thing bothering me is that the screen dims and screen saving after one or two minutes. I want to keep it active when it is charged. it turns out to be difficult (or just I am being stupid) to change this setting. Searched online, and tried a few suggestions. Still haven't worked out.
