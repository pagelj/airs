Just Started Using it, So Far So good
Because of my hectic schedule, this product sat in its box for quite awhile.  I only opened it up and used it this weekend.  I'm quite the novice and don't really know what I'm doing, but I did learn a couple of tricks.  First, the steam only comes out when the setting is on silk and higher.  I found the higher the temp, the faster the wrinkles come out.  I was amazed at how nicely it does work.  My only problem is that I can't figure out how to do long-sleeved shirts.  I can't seem to get the sleeve to stay down flat to press, as it bunches up, and eventually had to end up ironing them with my other iron.  Anyone have any tips? But all in all, I really do like it.  And once I master shirts, look out!  I'll probably open up my own steam press in the neighborhood. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star as opposed to a five, is the shirt thing. P. S.  Setting it up was a snap!  The instructions are very easy.  My only suggestion to the manufacturer, is send a video along to show us how to professionally steam shirts!
