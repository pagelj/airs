Good idea, mediocre execution
I love the idea of this but the reality doesn't match the hype. First of all, the dock would freeze at fairly random times, and at other times lose the mouse/cursor (it would stop responding). Secondly, other than being a big screen (and charger) for your phone, the ONLY thing you can do is browse the web. Via a not-upgradeable version of Firefox. Various apps, including Kindle Cloud, wouldn't run and insisted on an upgrade. I waited for the price to come down below $200 but even at that price, it's really not worth it. Returning it - going to buy a Chromebook instead.
