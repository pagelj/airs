Good charger for Evo 4G
I bought this to keep in my car for charging my HTC Evo 4G.  It works very well.  It fits in the vehicle "power socket" (what we used to call a cigarette lighter...) securely.  The round end glows blue when it is powered, which is handy though I suppose it could be distracting at night depending on where it is in your vehicle.
