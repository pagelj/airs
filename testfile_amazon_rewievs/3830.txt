What happened to the point......?
The fire-steel is great. The coating that someone else mentioned is there for protection. Once you scratch it off on one side, the sparks will fly as far as you push them with the knife. I was scratching sparks over 15' with it. It was great fun :) As for the knife, it comes field sharp but mine had a glob of coating that kept the point from really coming through. Remember that if you  put an amazing edge on anything, the edge will dull faster and have a huge chance of chipping metal from the edge. So if you're not planning on using this for skinning where you need a super sharp edge, I wouldn't recommend putting a sharper edge on this knife to prolong the life of the blade.
