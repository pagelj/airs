We've been enjoying delicious toast since we purchased this Breville unit 14 months ago. Looks great on the counter. Stays cool to the touch. Lots of settings for various breads and rolls. I like the audible alarm feature when the toast is ready. Wish the toaster could notify me when I'm out of earshot. How about an iPhone app to let us know when the toast is ready?
