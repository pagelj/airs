I bought the Zojirushi from Amazon for my company approximately five years ago.  It is still going strong after all these years and, trust me, it gets plenty of use!  I love that there's no hotplate to give the coffee that old, burnt taste and since it goes off automatically when it's finished brewing, there's no worry about leaving it on when we go home at night.  It's a great coffee maker!
