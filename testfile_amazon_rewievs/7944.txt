So far, so good.
I ordered these batteries just after making a selection on a new flashlight.  Other reviewers rated these units very highly, so I bought a four-pack; the price is in line with other Ni-mh batteries I'd previously purchased. They were charged when received, so I stuck 2 in the camera, & 2 in the flashlight.  That was just about a month ago, & both devices are cruising right along. So far, excellent results from a rechargeable.  Only 4 stars because I haven't even been through one charge cycle yet; I expect a fifth star will show up in the future.
