Sweet and hot
Haven't read any of the other books associated with this short story, but I've been looking forward to trying out this author, and this one was free so I thought I'd give it a try. Loved it.  The writing brings the character to life, painting the picture of an insecure but curious (ok, horny) teenage girl who's willing to explore.  We're allowed to witness two events in her life, written in a down-to-earth style that's endearing. The sex is hot, but what makes this story special is Lexie's personality and humor.  Enjoyed this book so much I had to read more of Ms. Strong's work, so I purchased Bliss.  Looking forward to reading it. Well done.
