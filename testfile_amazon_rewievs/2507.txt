Good value
This monitor is very basic and simple but it works as advertised. For $100 this is good value and I can finally enjoy sleeping peaceful at night. Best thing about this monitor is the night vision - it shows everything visible within 5 feet of the camera! We are also very glad to report we did not have any problems or interference with of internet signals in our house.
