great blu ray
great quality blu ray but I have some issues with the brighness and colors. I think the colors and the picture qulaity are not great at times. I played this in both my samsung tv and also on 150' projector screen. not as good as when I compare this to other blu rays like spider man etc. may be it is due to 1:1.78 (16:9) format.
