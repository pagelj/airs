The Dyson DC33 Multi floor is perfect for my home (carpet, wood floor, stairs, linoleum).  I have tested other Dyson vacuum models with ball technology, but I definitely prefer the DC33.  It feels much easier to control than the ball.  I don't find it very difficult getting around furniture or tight spots.  If I can't get to something I use the attachments which I like to use anyway for stairs, base board and trim.  If you are on the fence about which model to buy - I recommend going for the DC33.
