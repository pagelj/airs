Its okay - Get what you paid for
Its okay. I try not to buy cheap but this is not going to be used everyday, just a case to protect my laptop from dust. I had to get a replacement because the first case was starting to tear inside one of the sleeve. What you need to look out for is STITCHING. Make sure to avoid future tears from light packing. Other than the tear, the new replacement bag did the trick, it is still holding up well, after 3-4 months of light use.
