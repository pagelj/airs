great bag, but eggplant is DARK PURPLE!
this is a great bag with all of the features shown, and when I ordered it I got an eggplant bag.  so what's wrong?  the picture they show for the color "eggplant" is a light pinkish-purple, and what you're really getting is a very dark purple or true eggplant.  great bag, but you should either show the correct picture or change the color title.  if I had known that the color would be so dark, I would have gone for the navy one.
