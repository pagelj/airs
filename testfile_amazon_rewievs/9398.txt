Excellent
I bought this for my husband as he tends to be rather hard on power cords such as these.  Once I got it, I was immediately pleased with the quality.  The cord is thicker and firmer than the original cord distributed with Apple's products.  The length may seem over kill. But it's very helpful in avoiding extra stress on the cord that can be caused by pulling and bending the cord while trying to use your Apple product during charging. I highly recommend investing in this, you won't be disappointed!
