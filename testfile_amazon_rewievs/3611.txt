Logitech C310
The VidHD is nice but can't be used with Skype, which is what I use. After installing the software, my computer's performance did suffer (I do have Windows XP so maybe that was it?).  The software is useful for taping videos and taking pictures - which the kids and I did. As for the features of autofocus and motion detection and what-not, I found these features made the video conferencing on Skype freeze up.  I used it with my parents on a good connection and it happened and when there was a low signal with my husband overseas it froze like crazy. I uninstalled the software and driver and the webcam worked great on Skype and had a great quality image and clear audio when used connecting to my husband and also with my family in country. So it depends on what you need this camera for.  In order to do plain old Skype with family and friends I would recommend NOT using the software. I hope this is helpful to others.  It is a nice camera and some of the features are useful for those who need them.  The quality of the image was worth the purchase.
