Does what it suppose to do
I bought this sleeve because I needed something to protect my MacBook Pro 13" while I carry it around in my duffel bag. Sometimes I carry around two laptops, one for work and one for my own business. I don't want to put both laptops in my messenger bag because it can get too heavy. So I throw my MBP into my duffel bag while I am using my work laptop. Read the review for the new Case Logic LAPS-213 and one of the reviewer said it was too big for her MBP 13inch. Bought this one instead because it is a perfect fit. It does what it is suppose to do and what I was looking for. A nice slim sleeves. I can put this sleeve on my MBP and still put it in my messenger bag. There is a lip around the zipper area to prevent scratching on my MBP. This sleeve will protect your laptop from being scratch but don't expect much more. There are padding so it does give some protection. Overall, I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the tannin color turned out to be a deep purple. I was expecting more of a brown color. That is more of a preference than a knock on the product itself.
