Do Not Recommend
I have purchased several cameras over the past year, and this is by far the worse camera I have ever bought. It may have 30x Wide Optical Zoom, but what good is that when it takes so long for it to focus and the pic caputred (after it take so long to focus) comes out blurry. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have a 3 year old son and one on the way and need a camera that will get good shots on moment notice, not miss a great shot because the camera is trying to focus.
