Not as versatile as i would have hoped.
On the plus side, the construction seems to be generally solid.  If I had different gear, I probably would have been happy enough with the construction.  The only real design limitation, as others have mentioned, is that the addition of a small lumbar cushion means that the bottom of the zippered main compartment is quite difficult to access. My lenses, which have an attachment for a filter system on the front end of the lens, did not fit easily into the lens slots.  Though the system of dividers is somewhat customizable, it was not customizable enough.  The inside of the bag has velcro only in specific places, so there are only so many configurations that can be tried.  None of the possible configurations fit my camera, 3 lenses, and filters.  That was another design limitation, I suppose... there weren't great spaces for a series of filters.  I will return it and try another bag.
