After several coffee pots that didn't work right, died early, or were just a pain to use, we decided to try this based on the great reviews.  It's a gem!  Coffee is hot, carafe keeps it that way for hours, and it's a cinch to use.  The ONLY down side is the lack of timer, so someone has to get up to turn it on in the morning.  After a few days, we decided it's worth the effort to get flavorful, piping hot coffee from a simple, straightforward coffee maker.  We love it!
