Love this Case. Works great
I bought one of these cases at a horse show and love it. It is no too bulky to wear all the time, and it does not interfere with most of my daily chores. It is slightly stretchy so it does not cut off circulation to my leg and is perfect for horse back riding. The velcro keeps it securely closed but easy for one handed opening. I recommend this product to everyone.
