Does the job and does it well
Absolutely no difference in sound quality when compared to similar cables priced at $30 or more. It never ceases to amaze me that people believe that there is a difference in sound quality when it comes to fiber optic cables. A bitstream is a bitstream.. it cannot be corrupted unlike copper wiring or wireless connections. You pay $50, I'll pay $10, and we're both going to be listening to the same 5.1 channel bliss. :)Btw.. the same goes for HDMI cables.. spend $5-$10.. not $30-$100 for a 3-6' cable. There is no difference in quality.
