Very nice backpack
This is an excellent backpack, The seams and stitching hold up very nicely, even after a year or two of use. Only thin do the stitches get a little loose and the part around the zipper looks fuzzy. The straps are comfortable, and the pack has so many pockets so you can pack lots of stuff, but not too many so you forget which pocket your binder was in. Note to buyers: This backpack is very tall, but not very wide. I can fit about two textbooks and two 1/2 inch binders in the biggest pocket, and one 1/2 inch binder in the second largest, and maybe 2 pencil cases in the smallest one. If you are looking for a nice, big-pocketed backpack, this is not made specifically for you. You could still use it, with the other pockets, but I do not recommend it for those people. I love the clip on the outside and the water bottle holders on the side. I also like the 2 small pockets to fit my cell phone and iPod in. Overall, the best pack I ordered!
