My old vacuum gave out on me and I was forced to find a replacement.  I researched vacuums for almost a week.  I looked at Consumer Reports and every other online resource that I could find.  It was difficult for me to make my choice because the market is flooded with vacuums that have attachments and features out the whazoo.  I was leaning towards a more expensive model by another manufacturer.  But I recalled that Consumer Reports had named the Bissell Clearview Helix as their number one "Budget Vacuum."  As I comtemplated my choice, I reached for the Bissell and walked to the register to make my purchase.  When I got home, I immediately assembled the vacuum and gave it a test run.  I was amazed at how much dirt it picked up.  I'm a bachelor and don't have many people over, with the exception of my children and one or two frineds.  So my carpet "APPEARED" to be clean.  Was I surprised.  The Bissell picked up dirt that my old vacuum had left behind.  So I decided to vacuum my whole apartment.  The dirt that the Bissell picked up shocked me even more.  I just know that my old vacuum was getting the job done.  Boy was I wrong.  This vacuum cleaner doesn't have a huge price tag, but it delivers big on results.  I highly recommend the Clearview Helix.  The best part, there's no bags to purchased.  Nothing worst than having to dump those dirty bags.
