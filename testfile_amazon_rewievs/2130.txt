Great Product
Very easy to set-up email, Netflix, Pandora, Skype, etc, and of course, Amazon.  Wireless works great from anywhere in my house and even from about 50' outside.  The screen resolution makes everything really pop and the stereo speakers sound great.  With headphones, it sounds even better. I purchased 2 micro HDMI to HDMI cables for it.  One 15' to use at home connected to my TV and a 6' to take with me when I travel to connect to the TV in the hotel.  It's great to have all my streaming content from Netflix and Amazon wherever I go.  I did sideload the Dolphin browser and a version of flash that works with it, so that I can watch other video formats. The APP store is really overloaded with games for kids.  I guess people must use their devices as babysitters.  But I did find some useful free APPS.  I recommend YOUZEEK, which seems to have all the music on youtube in categories, by artist. I am a guitar player, so I can plug my Kindle Fire HD into my PA, fire up YOUZEEK and jam along with my favorite artists while I watch the video (if youtube has the video). I also recommend the PBS video APP, Flixter, Urbanspoon, IMDb, Norton Mobile Security free APPS. I purchased the powerfast charger with my Kindle and it works great. I also bought a rooCase for it which is a great value.  It puts the Kindle to sleep when closed and wakes it up when you open the case.  I also control the volume from the dropdown menu, so I don't have to deal with the hard to locate on/off and volume rocker buttons.  Those buttons are the only thing I would change about the Kindle Fire HD.
