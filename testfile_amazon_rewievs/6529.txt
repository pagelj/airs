God's Love is Merciful
Redeeming Love is a love story between Man and Woman, God and Human.  The story is based on the biblical Story of Hosea and Gomer. The story is well written and more than just a modern day love story.  Mrs. Rivers shows God's love for us so easily and leaves no doubt how much God loves us. The novel has you shaking your head in God's unconditional love for us. The novel also she shows if you love God and follow his will and not your own will, you can fine true love. Mrs. Rivers uses Redeeming Love to show us "Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Love never ends. 1 Corinthians 13:4-8a (ESV)" There is not one quality in Redeeming Love that was not good. I love how she changed the font to show God or the Devil talking to the characters. Reading Redeeming Love made me take a look at my relationship with God and my husband and made me want to be more patient and understanding with my husband and try to get a stronger relationship with God. Redeeming Love showed me what it really means to love someone as God Loves you. Mrs. Rivers did an excellent job with this story and you can tell she put a lot of thought in this novel.  Francine Rivers is a true Christian Fiction author. I can feel the God coming out of the pages. I plan to see what other books that Mrs. Rivers have written that reinforced God's Messages that some time we tend to over look or forget.
