Well worth the price
I wasn't sure if I had made the right choice, in purchasing a refurbished Canon battery for my SLR camera.  I have bought many refurbished electronic devices and had great results with all of them, so why not a battery.  At first I thought, how can one refurbish a battery?  No matter, it is a great battery for a great price.  I knew I wanted a Canon battery because of its durability, but I really didn't want to spend over $50, so I opted for the refurbished one for half the price.  It was a great decision.  Save your money and buy this refurbished battery instead of a new one, it holds a charge just like a new one.  Replace your battery with your camera brand, I recommend a new or refurbished one. I am really happy with this purchase.  Now that I have tested this battery, i plan on purchasing another one.
