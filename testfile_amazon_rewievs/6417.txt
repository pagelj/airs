I have been a vacumn snob for the last 20 years. I thought that the only good vacumn was an expensive Oreck. But my Mom bought one of these vacumns and FORCED me to check it out. I was amazed! This little miracle worker picks up the stuff my Oreck has been leaving behind for 20 years. It's great on pet hair and also sucks up all the fine silt that is buried in my carpets. I thought I would hate the bagless system but I actually like knowing that an area is clean by watching what is collecting in the canister. Dumping it nd cleaning the filter is a minor irritation but again it's worth it to me because I know it's picking up all the GICK! It's true that it doesn't perform well on tile or hardwood floors but I could care less because its a champ on the carpets.  I just sweep everything onto the carpets and vacumn it up. I have purchased 3 of these vacumns for work and home and all 3 are top notch performers. And the affordable price is just the bonus!!! I listed my Orecks on Craigslist and said Hasta la Vista without regret!
