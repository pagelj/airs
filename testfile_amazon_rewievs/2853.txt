Mediocre, Affordable built-in WiFi blu-ray player
I am a fan of samsung products although lately their android phones really disappointed me.  None the less I didn't want to spend more then 100.00 on a blu-ray player and I did not want a player that required those ANNOYING lil wifi adapters in order to get a wireless connection, I wanted it with wifi built-in. I found about 3 that met these 2 requirements- toshiba, sony and samsung.  My first choice was the sony which they were out of. Like I said I do like samsung products overall so I went with this model blu-ray player. It has a sleek somewhat mini design so it fits just perfect on my medium size tv stand. When not using the remote the buttons on the player are simple and they are soft touch buttons and not buttons you actually have to push down. It comes with most of the popular apps installed- netflix, pandora, youtube, best buy's cinema now, and my personal fav... vudu! Most important the picture quality is superb! The only nagging issue that brings this player down is the slow responsiveness of the player's remote!! You will need some patience when using it and you must stand right in front of it for it to work properly. Overall though I think it is a wise buy if you want a decent but not perfect wifi blu ray player and your on a budget.
