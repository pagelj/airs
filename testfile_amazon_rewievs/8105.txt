Did not see it coming.
This book was recommended by my best friend who thinks a lot like me. He said this book was awesome and he was right. I had a hard time putting it down. I just finished it and it is 3:53am.. Any one who loves the eighties and games must read this book. Thank little bro for the recommendation..
