Rugged & Tough is the name!
I love this Backpack loads! I bought the Black/light gray colorand I can report that it is a tough son-of-a-gun with looks tooit looks like tat bad boy you would find intact when every otherthing is destroyed on the scene of an accident involving speedand impact. It's hot dude!
