Perfect!
I like the lens storage this bag offers. You can adjust lens storage compartments to accommodate different sized lenses. There is also a loop on the outside to hold your tripod. This bag is a bargain for the price and storage it offers since bags this size and quality are more expensive. This is a great quality camera bag and I would recommend it to anyone.
