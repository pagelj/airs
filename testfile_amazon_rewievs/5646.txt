GOTTA BUY THIS LENS
Buy this lens without a moment's hesitation. Unbeatable price for a wicked fast extremely sharp lens. Yeah it's plastic. Yeah the focus ring is almost non-existant. But you can search and search and test and read but you will not find a more loved better performing lens for this price anywhere. After you buy your camera, your immediate next purchase has to be this lens. Watch as your portraits go from point-and-shoot "blah" or kit lens "meh" to "oh, THIS, is why everybody wants an SLR!". Better looking shots from the first shutter snap and it gets better as your comfort level increases. Canon and others make more expensive better lenses in this focal length but this is tops for bang-for-the-buck. Buy it already!
