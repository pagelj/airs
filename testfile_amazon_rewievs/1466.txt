This is a great improvement over the step cans that Simplehuman used to make.  You don't need to use Simplehuman's can liners; store brands fit fine.  I have no problems with odors.  The locking lid is a big plus if you have curious toddlers or pets.  And this is a great price.  I paid much more for mine at Bed, Bath & Beyond.
