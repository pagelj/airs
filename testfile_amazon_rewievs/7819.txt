I did research on panasonic & it rated the best. I have had panasonic before the batteries started to fail. Never had a problem with the phones. It would have cost more to replace the batteries than purchase an updated system. ,Extremely pleased with the AMAZON purchase, they had the lowest price. I am considering buying a set for my family as a Christmas gift.
