Could not put it down.
It is 5:35a. m. and I just finished reading this story. I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to grab it and continue reading it. There was just a lot going on and new information kept popping up but that's what made me not be able to put it down. Everything that is mentioned is for a reason there are no unfinished thoughts that are not followed through. Evolution, subspecies, Nazis, 9/11, the lost city of Atlantis, I mean just amazing. Well done!
