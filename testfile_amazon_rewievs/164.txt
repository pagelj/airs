Camera
I bought this when it was a special. My children like to take pictures andI wanted something that wouldn't brake easily. It also takes movies whichthe kids LOVE being creative to produce. I don't like the "game" aspect. I didn't want something that my children would want to sit and play. But Ilike the picture taking and camcorder aspect so much that I would but this again.
