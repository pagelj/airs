I was so happy when I got the kindle fire - I am an avid reader and won it in our church raffle.  The first thing I tried was the library - with >180K books I felt this was a great deal.  HOWEVER - when I got near the end of the book (99%), you must write your opinion and send it to facebook or one of the many other websites.  Well, I DONT HAVE FACEBOOK NOR DO I WANT FACEBOOK or any other popular sites.  I think there should be a way to opt out of giving your opinion. WHO CARES what I think about a book. The book is for me ONLY.  I don't know when I can return the book to the library and try another but I think this is a very bad flaw in the system.  Also, I tried buying books.  The same thing happens - they stick you at 99% unless you give an opinion.  BOO HISS!!!!!
