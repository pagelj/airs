Excellent little camera
We purchased this camera for my mother. It took some reading to get to know how to use some of the features, but it is still much simpler to use than many cameras. It is very small, but produces excellent results. The video was equal to, or possibly even better, than the same video I took on my digital camcorder. I personally have an older small digital camera, an SLR digital camera, and a digital camcorder. However, I am seriously considering getting one of these to replace those in most situations.
