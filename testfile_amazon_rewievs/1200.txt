Thrilled.
I was in the market for a "mid-level" DSLR as my second slr, and I have to say that I'm absolutely thrilled with this camera. For me, it was either Canon or Nikon, and I just decided to go with the Nikon after testing several and reading reviews. After reading the reviews, I was a little concerned about some of the reviews with malfunctions, but, after two months, I haven't had the slightest problem, and the picture quality is fantastic. I chose the D90 over the D5000 because I didn't like the flip screen (something to break off or go wrong, and I'd read reviews about the D5000's difficult readability in bright light with the LCD. I love the balanced weight of this camera with the lens, I bought a Hoya multicoated UV filter for scratches and have loved the pictures it's produced thus far. I can't tell you the costs and benefits as much as the others, but this camera has been quiet, quick, and efficient, and produced brilliant photos for my money. For me, there are a ton of features, some of which I may never use, but the bottom line is for me, looking through the viewfinder and getting a crisp, clean shot is what it comes to, and I'm so pleased I got this combo.
