Exceptional!
I'm using these in my larger external camera flash.  The recycle time on these is faster than any disposable battery I have tried (and I have tried most brands).  They charge up quickly also.  Very impressed.  If you use an external flash that is a battery hog, this is well worth it, not only for the money you will save on batteries, but also due to the faster recycle times you will see.  A++.  I wish I bought these years ago.
