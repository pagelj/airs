When I received this I was a tiny bit worried that it was smaller than my old vacuum, which I loved and had for years until it gave out on us. But.. upon turning it on I was amazed at the power it had. You can feel it. It is not the quietest vacuum ever, but with the power this thing packs, who cares? I am extremely pleased with it. And the smaller size (Not TINY, just a little smaller than normal) makes it more compact for storage. Recommend this for sure!
