Great Player So Far
The Price was right here. More importantly, the picture is beautiful and it takes up very little space. It worked very well with my Sony Bravia HDTV. The chord that plugs into the outlet could be a bit longer, but I was able to manage that. There were no AA batteries included for the remote and the warranty is only for 90 days; but for this price, who could complain? I just hope this DVD Player lasts a good few years. Set up took up less than a minute. No frills player, great picture with HDMI cable.
