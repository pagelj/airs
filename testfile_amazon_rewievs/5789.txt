A fair car DVR
PROS:1. No gap between files.2. 720P quality is good enough for me.3. Light and compact design.4. Mini-HDMI cable included. CONS:1. Doesn't work with the SiliconPower 8GB Class6 uSD card. Works fine with the SiliconPower 16GB Class10 uSD card.2. G-sensor is on every time you turn on the power. It records read-only files if you creates >4G vibrations. The SD card gets full soon.3. Build-in battery. Not easy to buy and change.4. Beeping sound every ~2-3 seconds. OTHERS: Bought it from the seller, BrainyTrade, as they have 1-yesr warranty. The camera model # is 2A118249. The 1080P file size is too big so I switch to 720P. The quality is acceptable. This is an OEM version of CarCam K2000.
