great, Mate!
The shipping was very fast, the product is great, and i have no complaints! And for the people who said the audio doesn't work, it actually does, you just need to go to system prefs, click on the "sound" menu and click the "output" tab and change the output to direct the sound through the Mini DispayPort. It works great!
