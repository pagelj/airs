I bought this coffee maker for my college apartment. I wasn't expecting much to be honest and I know that it isn't the best quality coffee maker on the market, but I just needed something to last me a few months at school. The feel of the glass and plastic let me know that it needed to be handled with care, so this is definitely not a product for heavy hands. But its been very reliable. I planned on tossing it after the semester ended, but i'm still using it several months later.
