I really love this idea.  I have had it about 5 days now, so I don't know if I'll encounter a problem long term, but so far, it's great.  I turned it so that it won't open every time someone goes by and no problem with it opening all the time.  It looks much, much nicer than my old plastic one and I love not having to touch it to throw something away - really hygenic! Update 5/30/07:  Have had absolutely no problems with this!  Whenever anyone comes into my kitchen they "have to have one too"!  Love, love, love it! Updated update 4/12/08:  I did a dumb thing and reached over from behind the lid and tried to close it, but accidentally broke the closing mechanism.... so I immediately ordered a new one!  After having this in my kitchen, I just can't go back to a regular trash can!  And I think ALL my friends have these now!  Once someone comes in and sees it, I know they can't wait to get home and order their own!
