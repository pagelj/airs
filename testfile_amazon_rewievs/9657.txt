I have owned a lot of these little hand vacuum things, all purchased at Target or Walmart or Lowes, etc.  They all have had problems.  Some didn't have enough suction, some were hard to empty, some couldn't reach into corners.  I decided this time to read a lot of Amazon reviews and buy one based on that.  Well, this one beats every other one I've ever owned.  It is really powerful, which makes it louder than some, but worth the noise.  It has a small nozzle that reaches up high, under cabinets, into corners, all over the place.  You can turn the nozzle so you can reach in any direction, too.  And it empties without having to reach in and pull the dirt out.  It costs a little more than the ones you buy in the store, but it is worth it!
