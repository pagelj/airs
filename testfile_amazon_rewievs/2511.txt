My toaster has been broken for a year, and I was desperate for a piece of toast, or i might have sent this back. It is very rinky-dink, and i can't believe it will last a year. Takes two hands to insert a piece of bread as you need one to hold the toaster while you depress the lever or the toaster will tip over. Plus you have to depress it hard, or it won't catch. I'm sure that mechanism will be short-lived. But all said, it toasts okay and few to none of the toasters offered on Amazon get better ratings, even the expensive ones are apparently seriously flawed. The toaster is an important, much used small appliance in most American homes. Someone should be trying to turn out a decent one. Or maybe they do and Amazon prefers to offer junk. I'd be willing to pay much more for a safe, even toasting appliance that would last a life time, as they use to.
