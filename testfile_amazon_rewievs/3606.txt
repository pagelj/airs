I must say I was skeptical when I bought this appliance (the fact that it was on sale prompted me to give it a try).  I wondered how well something so lightweight, small, and inexpensive could actually clean.  Well this is over six months of use later and I am so pleased with this vacuum that I decided to sit down and review it.  This vacuum is exactly what I was looking for!  It is powerful enough to clean our entire apartment's hardwood and linoleum floors in one go round.  Because it's so lightweight I can change from the floor to the crevice tool in a jiffy allowing me to clean corners, molding, and windowsills quickly.  It can also be used as a handheld, which has come in handy for cleaning our blinds.  When used as a stick vacuum, this little device fits under everything from chairs to under the bed, where our old vacuum would get stuck or bang into our furniture.  I also really appreciate that this is environmentally and economically friendly by being bagless.  I can't say enough good things about this product!  It is a good item for a household with hardwood/linoleum/tile flooring although I've also used it somewhat successfully on our outdoor mat. Great for keeping the house tidy and minimizing dust and debris.  I hope it continues to be offered and at this reasonable price! Would definitely buy this again!
