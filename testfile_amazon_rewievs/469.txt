this cord is great
i bought this paracord to re-wrap my knife that i bought. i also used it to make new shoe laces for my winter boots. its a very versatile. product. you can put this cord in your tool box bugout bag its seems to be very strong plus its digital camo it matches all of my gun stuff im really into camo. it didnt cost much at $6.67 and free shipping it was a deal i highly recommend this product for a multitude of uses.
