mountek CD slot phone mount
works perfectly. holds my droid x in place and is e z to use. seems very secure and safe. only thing is though the web site says you can put it in grooves in the car i only find it works in the cd slot. truth is it does not matter as the CD slot is perfect place. have been able to take it to rental car so it is convenient.
