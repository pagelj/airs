At first, I thought this was the answer to freshly ground coffee in the morning without the hassle of using a separate grinder.  Unfortunately, the amount of time you spend cleaning the darn thing out completely negates the time you would have saved by using a separate grinder.  I've found myself taking my grinder out and using that separately as it's quicker than the clean up procedure which is a huge pain.  Not only do you have to get it clean, you have to make sure the grinding bowls are perfectly dry to keep fresh grounds from caking up all inside. Also, it requires you to put this little cover over the basket so the water gets distributed evenly on top.  After about 10 minutes of cleaning you sometimes forget it's even there, start your coffee brewing, and come back to find something that looks like tea.  This is one of those items that's good in theory but very annoying once you actually use it.
