Excellent Solar Charger
Rugged, water proof, good capacity, cool looking. What is not to like about this charger. I use it to charge my Samsung Note Phone, Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0 tablet and other gadgets. Just works great and does the job nicely. Excellent way to go "green" ! I charge it in my car while I am at work and then charge my devices each night with it. Good for road trips, camping, boating, motorcycles, and just about any outdoor adventure.
