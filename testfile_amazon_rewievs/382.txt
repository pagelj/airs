Micro sd card
Works exactly as advertised, used for smartphone backup. Works well, recognized by the device instantly. what more could you ask for. Recommend this micro card, I purchased them from Kingston in the past and never had a failure or the card not being recognized. Purchased a 32 gig at the same time, exact same results. Great product, works, all you can ask for.
