Ideal Commuting Bag
The High Sierra Tank Pack is a great messenger-style bag.  I commute on public transportation (commuter rail and subway) every day, and I wanted a bag big enough to carry all the little odds and ends I didn't want to be without between home and office, ideally tucked away in separate pockets so I wouldn't need to rearrange things to get to stuff I actually use every day, like sunglasses, ID, car keys etc.  This High Sierra bag doesn't overdo on pockets, but there are enough of these (two generous velcroed pockets, two roomy mesh pouches for items like a water bottle or collapsible umbrella)under the flap, in addition to the two roomy interior spaces for paper and notebooks.  Important to me is the exterior zippered enclosure on the outer flap, where I can store and easily access my ID card and rail passes without having to unsnap or fumble with interior pockets. Best of all, the bag is made of ultra-light material, so I don't start out lugging around 5 lbs worth of leather or canvas before putting anything inside.  Time will tell if the plastic flap snaps (much like those on backpacks) and zippers, which don't look heavy-duty, will stand up to daily use over a long period, but after the first month of regular use, this Tank Pack seems like the ideal purchase.
