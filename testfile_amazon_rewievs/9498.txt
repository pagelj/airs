Cheap body, poor microphone and terrible battery life
This phone despite the hype it had feels so cheap. The body specially feels like cheap plastic in hand. I replaced it with Nokia Lumia 900 and am pretty happy with my new phone, it's easy to hold and feels wonderful and solid. In addition, microphone has a very poor quality and battery life is very low.
