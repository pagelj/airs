I just purchased this vacuum, and I love the attachments for the dog hair. I used both the pet hair attachments to remove the dog hair from my truck seats and it worked amazingly. I'm so pleased with my new purchase. I also used it for my dogs beds and was very happy with the outcome. I will highly recommended this pet rewind to others with animals that leave there hair everywhere.
