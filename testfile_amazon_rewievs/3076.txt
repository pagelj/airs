Yeah, not so much.
I am sorry but I did not enjoy this book at all. It was going to get 2 stars but then 3/4 of the way through it got WORSE and the only reason I finished was to justify the time I had already committed to the book. That is time I am never getting back. The science is a mile wide and an inch deep, which I could have handled, except that the whole book is a mile wide and an inch deep.  Characters, dialogue, plot.  And then, the flimsy science is used to create convenient leaps that magically fill the plot holes that avoid, well.  If you want to read it, I won't ruin it for you. The writer misspells "gel caps" throughout the entire thing. They use evolutionary psychology as real science. And a continuing theme is that if there is no belief in God altruism is much harder to achieve. Clearly I am in the minority here but on this book, I have to say:(Blows raspberry)
