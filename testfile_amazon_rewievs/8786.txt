Breathless !!!
Okay let me just start by saying at first reading all the reviews I was not even going to read it but after reading the book glad I did I loved it 1st everyone was saying Mia had no back bone omg where did u get that from she was in love n when ppl are in love they'll do anything to be with that one person Mia was tough she stood up to gabe n got her point across at the end with her brother n she made gabe finialy realize what he knew all along !!!  No as far as the tears thing while giving him a BJ my god ladies who hasn't had that happened to them if ure man has that size package it happens if not then ure man is not packing that punch :) but what I was pissed at was when he put her in danger with those men that just pissed me off but after that he made it up to her so that was her choice to stay !!! 2nd some call this book porn ! "Not!!!" I see nothing any different then crossfire series n fifty shades of grey get a grip ppl u act like sex is a dirty little secret it's not how do u think u got here :) lol as for the book I actually like it better then fifty shades and bared to u I'm reading fever now I really don't understand the whole buzz saying there's no story there is to me when they put all that sad past in the books it's boring but this was straight to the point good for u maya banks u get a 5*****s from me :)
