It's Mylar, and it's cheap
While these are somewhat delicate, they work perfectly for keeping a tent warm when used as an extra layer of liner. I'm sure there are stronger products but this works great and it's so cheap that it's no big deal if you get little tears. The space-age look is also a plus, makes me feel like I'm in a capsule in a harsh environment. They won't be so good in a wind storm but I suspect that they could be useful in a blizzard if one had to dig a shelter in the snow, these things could help keep the space warmer and reduce melt. At least it'd be better than not having them. One of the major advantages of them is that each pack is TINY for STORAGE but full-sized when unfolded so carrying a couple in your pack is no problem.
