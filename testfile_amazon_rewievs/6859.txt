Genuine Motorola charger - great value for HTC Evo 4g
As described in other reviews, you'll receive a sturdy vehicle micro-USB charger.  I purchased mine for HTC Evo 4g in Feb 2011 and have been pleased.  The charger quickly charges my Evo 4g (from 10 - 20% to full in about an hour or so with extended battery) as well as maintains the full charge when I am using battery intensive features simultaneously (e. g. screen on 100% time with GPS Navigation). One note that didn't bother me but others may not like - the circle part shown in the photo has a blue LED that is rather bright at night.  If you don't like being distracted during the evening as you drive, you may need to tape over or otherwise cover the light.  If you were to do this, it would not take away from the functionality of the charger.
