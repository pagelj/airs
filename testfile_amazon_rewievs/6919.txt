Tough little camera!  Works on all the water rides.
I've never owned a Digital point & shoot.  This one is great around kids. It can take getting bounced around and soaked by water rides at an amusement park. I would recommend buying a second battery though, the camera died after 4 hours of video shooting and pictures.
