Next to pressing,perk coffee is the best.  Grind your own beans.  This coffee pot has been very good to me.  I bought it 7 months ago and it produces fabulous coffee.  For years I had Farberware percolators.  After a few months the coffee produced would be cooler and cooler.  I bought at least 3 Farberware pots before I found this less expensive alternative.  It works great.  Excellent coffee.  I need to get the most out of my money.  This pot has not let me down. This pot does need a paper filter in the strainer, but I don't see that as a problem.... it is just easier to clean. Hope this helps in your decisions to buy a percolator.
