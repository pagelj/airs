Great Portable Charging Solution!
I love this portable charger. It is about the same dimensions of most phones these days, only about twice as thick, so it fits in my pocket.  My Samsung Galaxy SIII is a great phone with a few drawbacks, it uses an enormous amount of juice. That is where this product comes in. I can charge my phone up to four times on one charge. This is a high quality portable charger that is powered by four Samsung 2600mah 18650 batteries. These are the same proven cells that are found in many laptops and provide years of reliable service. These are not the cheap Chinese made grey market battery cells. Another feature is that it is compatible with all of my apple products including ipads and iphones, and charges them at full speed.
