I strongly recommend not buying this item
This DVR stopped working within an hour of use.  Then there was just a blank screen.  I pulled battery in an attempt to reboot it, no luck. I ordered another one just like this in the same order.  It was by Dowson. So I tried that one and it would not record. I returned both the next day.  They are cheap and the instructions are terrible.... stay away from these.
