Ditched cable and haven't missed it a bit
One day my wife commented that we had 100 channels and nothing worth watching.  We started discussing how much we were spending on cable - $100 a month.  When I realized that we were spending $12,000 every ten years on cable we decided it was time to cut the cord.  We bought an antenna and I put it in the attic.  It picked up 30 channels and the picture quality was better than what we got with cable.  Then we purchased the Roku.  I tried using a laptop to do the same thing, but it was a pain to connect and disconnect and it wasn't very efficient when trying to find programming. The Roku was easy to install and worked right away.  It is important that you have a pretty high quality internet service and a good modem.  If you have poor internet service you will probably be frustrated with Roku. That isn't a problem with your Roku as much as it is a problem with your internet service. We planned on subscribing to Hulu or Netflix, but so far we haven't seen the need.  There are plenty of free movie channels available and we already had an Amazon Prime membership, so that has given us plenty of viewing options so far. The Roku remote is simple to use.  It can be difficult to scroll through movies and tv programs to find what you want, but we use the watchlist that some channels have to keep track of things. If you want an inexpensive option to cable I would highly recommend Roku.
