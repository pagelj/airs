Vegas, marriage and fears
Vegas baby ! Imagine waking up and finding a ring on your finger and a man who says he's your husband and you don't remember even his name. Well that's what happens when in Vegas. Connor her new husband is happy to have her as his wife she is everything he wanted a partner without emotional ties. She is not so happy, she was just going to the sperm bank to get her prego on and stay  very unattached to a man, they only leave you anyway. How did this happen, annulment time ! He challenges her to try it for three months, in his beach house in San Diego. (sign me up) He is gorgeous, knows how to wear a tux, has made a fortune and has no interest in love. It was predictable and yet I couldn't tear myself away from the drama of these two. They are damaged and they don't even know it till they have to try to live together. A quick enjoyable romance.
