Works well
Basically this works for the way I use my laptop. Fits up to a Vaio 460 w/o covering front vents, but does take some adjusting. Has raise rear feet for a comfortable angle on the keyboard and doesn't slid around. It's fairly quiet to me. Yet it doesn't blow notes off the desk. The USB T'ed into a double ended plug so one can add plug another cable into it. Hasn't been much of a power draw so far. Most of all it does a good job cooling. Lights are okay but could do without. I just want a clear pad. The fan are not covered underneath so you can't put on your lap. Else the fans will hit your clothing. Also would be nice to have an off switch for my needs as it doesn't shut down in the sleep mode. Delivery was prompt and hassle free.
