This vacuum is good because it is lightweight and for someone who vacuums daily that is very important.  A great amount of power and suction but maybe a bit to much for linoleum floors. The hose is not user friendly as some vacuums. This vacuum sucked stuff up from my carpet I didn't know what left from my other vacuum. I also love how quiet it is."I received a sample of this product to facilitate my review, but my opinions are entirely my own."
