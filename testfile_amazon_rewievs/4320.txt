Works, but getting card read errors
I purchased this for use with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet. I did not have any issues for file transfers on the device itself. However, the problem started when I used it to transfer some files (books mainly) from my PC to read on the tablet. File transfer on my PC would show that the files have been copied onto the card, and I did confirm the files were on the card. However, when I put the card back it in my tablet, the card would not show any files. This happened repeatedly. I had no issues with an 8GB San Disk or a 32 GB Transcend microSD cards that I have. I have used SD cards from Kingston previously without any issue. This was probably a lemon (happens) and I ended up returning it.
