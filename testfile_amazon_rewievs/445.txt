Great prime lens
I've enjoyed photography since the 70s. This Canon f1.8 50mm lens is very sharp and accurate and light weight. Zoom lens are fun and versatile but a fixed focal length lens will almost always be sharper and manage depth of field better. Aberrations are quite minimal on this lens. The 1.8 50mm is a great value and highly recommended. One last thought. Some reviews comment on build quality. Canon uses a composite lens mount instead of metal. This lens is physically short and very light weight. The use of a composite is smart engineering. The physics of such a short lens would dictate that there will be minimal stress placed on the mount compared to the leverage and stress that a longer (telephoto) lens would have.
