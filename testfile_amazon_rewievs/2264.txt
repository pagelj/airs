More please!
I picked up this book at the airport because it had an intriguing title. For once, I lucked out and found an excellent book. This is an author worth pursuing. I was delighted to find that this is the first in a trilogy. It was a beautifully written book. The main characters are very human. Their tragic pasts are overcome by the end of the book without syrupy prose and syrupy sweet or too-quaint characterizations of small town village people. The description of life in West Ireland felt realistic. The main and supporting characters had flaws and shared an ironic sense of humor which I found refreshing. Beware, this is a very quick read. You will be left wanting more.
