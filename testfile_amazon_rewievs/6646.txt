Very fast compact DC
I bought it in $299.99 to replace my old LX3. The f1.4 fast lens and very fast focus made taking pictures more easier. I could capture my kids in action without turning on the 11fps burst. Focus is instant and accurate like SLRs do. Even I constrained ISO to <800, I still can take good pictures at night w/o turn on flash, thanks to the large lens and image stabilization. This model met my needs and expectation: small, fast, good image quality and relatively cheap. The reason I did not rate 5 stars is: small image sensor(1/1.7"), even in f1.4 the blur effect is still poor. HD movie has 10min limitation. I wish they will release larger sensor (>1") in the next version, include GPS/WiFi function and social network (FB, Instagram...) function...
