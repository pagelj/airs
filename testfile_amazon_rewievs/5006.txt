Does its job
I finally caved and bought the charger because charging it on the laptop or other external chargers for 10+ hours daily was not working out for me. It charges fast and works like it is advertised to. Only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is that like everybody else that reviewed here, I really think this should have been part of the kindle in the first place.
