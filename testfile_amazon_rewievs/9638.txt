Love my new D90!
I won't get into all the details, which are covered in the other lengthy reviews. I've researched this camera alot! I've decided to retire my Canon and Olympus cameras and take advantage of my boyfriend's huge selection of Nikon lenses and accessories (he just bought a D300 to replace his brand new D200!) I've having so much fun with this new camera. One complaint, Live View! Focusing takes soooooo long, compared with the Olympus and Canon. I shoot low a lot and this is a function that I've habitually used with my Canon. I guess I'll get over that habit quickly and find other ways to quick-shoot without the hassle of Live View. I'll use it only for framing. I shoot one-handed more than not, and the ergonomics of this camera are perfect for my style. It's also very light-weight. I got the kit with the 18-105 lens. This has been a fine multi-purpose for my shooting so far. I still give it a 5-star rating. What a fabulous camera.
