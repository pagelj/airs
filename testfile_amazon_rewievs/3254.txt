cheap !!!
this product is made out of a very cheap plastic ! its small and can only hold a netbook or so. Its open at the bottom and the fan are not covered as  the fan can stop any moment if anything touches it. Electrically, i guess its not very safe! The only thing cool is the lights when its on and also the price and its got 3 fans. Other than that, if you want a durable laptop cooler , this is not for you !
