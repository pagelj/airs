not a lot of thought went into this one when designed
Like I said... not a lot of thought went into this by the people who designed this product. They should have made the griddle deeper.... and it really wouldn't have been difficult to do this. I bought this to be an all around grill/griddle. Well the griddle is useless every time you pour eggs into it to scramble they run over the sides. If I would have kept the box I would have sent it back. Oh well, hopefully this review will help someone else and the design will get changed. Buyer beware this product is junk currently the way it is designed. Thank you.
