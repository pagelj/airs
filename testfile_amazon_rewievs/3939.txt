Works for me and I'm a moron.
This cable has received a lot of attention on Amazon, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents. I'll write the most simple review I can:Me buy this cable. Me plug this cable between Sony PS3 and Philips 42" LCD TV. Sony PS3 say "HDMI Detected". TV say picture from source is "HDMI 1080p". Me point to Monster cables and laugh. I will now go back to banging coconuts together. Thank you.
