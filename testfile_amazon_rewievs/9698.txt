Good OEM LCD
This is a good LCD screen for the 4th Gen ipod. It ships fast and comes well packaged. A good OEM product that replaces the factory Apple LCD. After installation I haven't had any problems. Some aftermarket screens go white after a few months of use. This screen meets Apples standards.
