This can holds standard size 13 gallon trash bags. Roll the bag over inside insert and you do not see the bag after the lid is placed on it. I love the auto open and close, plus if you need to hold the lid open there are two separate buttons one to open one to close. I have not had any problems with the lid opening on its own when walking by it and it faces toward the walking path of my kitchen. I purchased this can for the touchless quality of the lid plus there is no smell. No deodorizer is needed. For me, two people household, I only empty the bag one every 7 days. The weight of the stainless steel is not heavy, you would not want to abuse the can by kicking it or anything as it would dent if you did so. It looks exactly as it is pictured online.  I have been using this can for about 2 1/2 months and the original batteries are still going strong. Yes, I would recommend purchase to my friends.
