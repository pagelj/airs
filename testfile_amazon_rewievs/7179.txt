worked once but please read on about what happened
the first title and rating of this was "worked once" with a rating of 1 - that was before customer service got involved which they did by actually reading the below review - i did not contact them - they contacted me and after some questions etc about the unit i had replaced it within one week with a new one - they have even checked up to make sure the new one is working properly - i am impressed with their service - please read on - but consider this - they are willing to stand behind the product without question it seems - if there is a problem i would suggest you contact them right away as i am sure they will do what needs to be done - after all this i would have to rate the product and customer service a 5the below is the review as it was written to start with -Purchased this to charge batteries while bicycle touring,  would have one battery in the phone and the other in this hooked up to a solar panel.  It had all the right things to do that. However in the home trial using a wall socket it charged one battery and then quit completely. At ten bucks its not worth the hassle of return so it got pitched and i am now searching for another that will do what I need it to, one of which is work more than once. LATER THAT DAY UPDATE - i was totally surprised to have received a phone call from this company just because of this review.  for a 10 dollar item??? the person left a message that they wish to resolve this issue and that there were several options available - i responded with an email - i am impressed this company would take the time to contact me about this, perhaps there is hope after all and i would say that as it stands now customer service at anker gets a 8 out of 10 from me right now as i am impressed by this, what will happen next??? i will to be fair keep you posted good or bad.2 days later - after responding to several emails from IANKER asking for the type of batteries i was trying to charge - th serial number which it did not have and then asking for a photo of the back of the unit - a new unit has been shipped - i must admit customer service at this place is excellent - now - lets hope this new unit lasts more than one charge - i will be back to report on the new one
