There is no way 929 people gave this book a 5 star rating
First off, this is the type of book/subject I would normally enjoy a lot.  But it stinks.  A million pages devoted to growing potatoes.  I understand why this is important to the story, but it could have been told in about 1/2 million less pages.  The constant use of the "F" word is just boring.  Does the author think this makes him, or the lead character look cool?  It only makes them look uneducated.  Paragraph after paragraph devoted to body waste functions also just gets boring.  I again understand why this is necessary to the story, but not in this detail.  Did the author have trouble with potty training. When I read the description of this book, my first thought was this was written for me.  But it wasn't. I'm serious about the 929 five stars reviews.  Do this mean the review system has been hacked?  Or every one in the author's hometown was paid to write a review?  I can't belive 929 people even finished this book.  What a waste of a great story idea.  He should have sold the idea to an real author.
