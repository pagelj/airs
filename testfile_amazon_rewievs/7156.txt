A great value for the price
My only quibble with this toaster oven is that the suggested temperatures on food packaging are not at all accurate in terms of this oven, even though often the temperature are specifically for toaster ovens. Something that is supposed to cook for 22 minutes at a given temperature is often burned beyond recognition and not edible - so you just have to learn the correct temperature for each item by experimentatiion. Otherwise, I think it is a great value.
