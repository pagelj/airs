When it comes to performance, this is a great little vacuum... with one major drawback. Here are my notes on some of the features that commonly get commented on for the Navigator. First for the good:* Suction - Works great, no complaints there.* Width of cleaning head - Is it a bit narrow compared to other vacuums? Yes, but I have found this to be a bonus because I can easily get it into places that would normally be difficult.* Maneuverability - Very easy to move and turn. Doesn't feel awkward and strange like a Dyson ball, but maneuvers just as well, if not better.* Cord length - Some people say it is too short. I'm not seeing it; the cord is a fine length.* Cup size - If you've been using an old vacuum for a long time, then the first time you use this you'll probably fill the cup pretty fast. Other than that, the cup is a fine size (though I don't have pets). Now for the bad:* Cleaning wand - The cleaning wand is a joke. If you have high ceilings, this is not the vacuum for you. The wand and the hose that go to it are just too short to be useful. This wouldn't be so terrible except it leads to an even worse problem, which is....* Narrow wheel base + Short wand = disaster - Be prepared for this thing to tip over when you use the cleaning wand, because it will. If you leave the hose looped around the hook at the bottom, this should stop it from tipping over... but then you've made your already short cleaning wand too short to reach anything. My wife was using the wand to clean under a dresser and the vacuum fell on her, putting a good sized gash in her head. Overall:A great vacuum when it comes to suction, and a great price compared to a Dyson, but be aware the cleaning wand setup has major design flaws.
