Makes the phone hard to use
It might just be me, but I had trouble with the touch screen after putting this on my phone. It is thicker than other screen protectors I have used. I had to press hard in order to do anything, and my stylus didn't even work on it. I took it off after a day. I did give it 2 stars because I did like the mirror and the sleek look it gave my phone, I just did not like the thickness of it. I would not order it again.
