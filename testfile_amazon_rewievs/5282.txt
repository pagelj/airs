No more buying disposable batteries! Yay!
When I saw that Amazon had this Super Pack on sale, I snatched it up as fast as I can click the button and check out! I usually buy my batteries from Costco but recently got to thinking, why am I buying disposables? It's wasteful and definitely not good for the environment. And besides that, flashes can eat away at your batteries real quick. So, after reading reviews about these Eneloop batteries, I figured why not give them a try. I've heard and read so many rave reviews about them, especially from photographers. If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me. :P This Super Pack is a perfect little kit. I love that it comes in a carry case to keep everything organized. And that it comes with AAs, AAA, a charger, and both C&D adapters. The batteries came pre-charged so I was able to just start using them. I think these batteries will pay for itself time and time again. Goodbye disposable batteries! Hello Eneloop! :) I would totally recommend these over other rechargeable batteries because they are tested to hold a charge longer if just sitting around. No one wants to find out that their "charged" battery depleted while sitting on the shelf, at the time they need it.
