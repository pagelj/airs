these are unbelievable
I just bought a high def tv and I heard that the best connection was with an hdmi cable (which of course doesnt come with the tv). Well I bought these instead of paying upwards of $25 at Best Buy and I tell you these work fantastically. You'll need one to connect the cable box to the tv and also one to connect a dvd or blu ray player to the tv. This is a product that the cheap price does not mean a cheap product.
