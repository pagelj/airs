Love it, wish it was a stand as well.
This is a great basic cover for the Kindle Paperwhite. Simple, easy to use, clean. It is thin and light, which is great if you're like me and you read for hours at a time, plus is adds very little bulk to the Kindle, so you can still stick it in your purse and take it with you everywhere. It comes in fun colors (I got the black) and the auto-on and auto-off feature works perfectly. I also love that it stays securely closed without an elastic strap. My only wish is that it would double as a stand.
