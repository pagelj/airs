Works Great!
I did a lot of research looking for a laptop stand. I almost bought the Griffin stand... but after looking at it in person and reading a few reviews I learned that the laptop might slide down over time... something u really don't want!! I needed a stand in which I could use the space underneath.. and this one has it. The construction is extremely strong!!! solid metal!! Griffin has plastic components. This stand will last for ever. I read a review in which it said that it was too slanted forward... and that the laptop screen will not open all the way to a comfortable viewing position.... that person said that u can bend it a bit and the problem was solved. I did not had that problem.. i have a 15" Power Book Pro. I tried bending it a bit to have a better angle... and let me tell u... this thing is rock solid. u might get a bend if u need... don't be afraid... there's no way of braking this. Mine works better that I expected.... I would recommend this product... and definitely will buy it again if i needed to.
