Best BD-Player so far.
Just received this player today 2-22-12 and hooked everything up easy.  when through a quick easy menu.  upgraded firmware from 1.28 to 1.33. after it rebooted it locked up.  i gave it 10 mins thinking it takes time to upgrade the firmware once it was done downloading. unplugged it and powered back up and went to radiant screen.  waited 5 more mins.  unplugged it and this time opened the door before it locked up.  unplugged again and this time disc went in and it said firmware was successful to 1.33 but could not do anything. unplugged one last time and left disc inside.  disc loaded  i shut off and turned back on ejected disc and everything is working great now. Awesome player everything works great but the update feature needs work. but in the end for $70 it was worth it.  beats my older aquos  BD-Player which takes its sweet time booting up and then sweet time loading disc.
