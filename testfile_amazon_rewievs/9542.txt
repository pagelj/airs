Surprisingly good for a freebie
Didn't have the highest of expectations since this one was 0.00 but was pleasantly surprised. Author attempts to have something a different plot than usual which is refreshing. The twist at the end was heavily foreshadowed so you saw it coming but that wasn't that surprising in that it was clearly being setup to be the first of a series - which would be my one criticism. I dislike the trend in publishing now that authors are focused on trying to create entire series of books rather than just focusing on producing one really good work and then if secondary characters become developed enough to warrant their own story they write it at a later time. But that being said, this book is an easy light read and worth the download.
