A bargain
For all 4 disks of these great mostly tonal neo-classical themes. Some symphonic ballads; more are wake-ups for Arnold Schwarzenneger, the ex-governor of our great failed state here in California. Orchestra overall plays as it would soft/loud/with chorus as in Holst PLANETS, plus a few odd sound effects and parades of interstellar hippos on the second disk; latter are what the "forward button" is for. Sound is almost as good as Erich Kunzel's similar output: some would say these versions are somewhat smoother. Requires good listening system to best appreciate--City of Prague oeuvre generally does not play well with car stereos/traffic. Try Amazon UK for maybe better pricing in USD.
