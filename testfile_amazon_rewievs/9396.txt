Perfect camera for the right situation
First, let me say this isn't the right camera for everyone.... No camera is.  But, if like me you:a) Value image quality above everything elseb) Spend time composing shots rather than rapid fire (i. e. not a sports or wildlife shooter)c) Prefer lightness rather than features you don't useThen, this is a great camera.  Don't let the negative reviews phase you.  The 6D is a superb piece of equipment.  The AF is extremely fast and accurate even in very low light.  Yes, I know there are only 11 AF points and only 1 cross type.  But 95% of the time, I'm on the center point anyway. If you expect to shoot sports, wildlife, or other fast moving action, then you should look elsewhere.  But for me, the 6D is perfect.
