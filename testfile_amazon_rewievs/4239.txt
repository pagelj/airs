must try this out
If you love fantasy or science fiction, you have to try out this magazine.  It comes full of great stories every 2 months.  This month my favorite story was Bronsky's Dates with Death by Peter David, though they were all great.  Sometimes I feel like just sitting down and reading though a story rather than getting myself tied up with a novel when things are crazy at work.  This magazine is the perfect way to do that. You might as well try out the 14 day trial, you don't have anything to loose.
