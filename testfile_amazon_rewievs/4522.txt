Best Laptop Backpack
I got this backpack because I am a college student and I was tired of carrying around a laptop bag as well as my backpack. I bought this for around $30, and for that it is a great deal. My laptop is a 15.6 inch laptop, I bought a 17 inch laptop backpack just so I know everything will fit(which it does). At first I had the issue that not everything was fitting how I would like it to, just because I carry a lot of things, but after a little organization everything fit(chargers, external hard drive, mouse, etc). I would recommend this backpack to anyone. Best purchase I've made in a while.
