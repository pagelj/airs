I Didn't Want It To End!
Loved, loved, loved this book/series of books! I love apocalyptic & post-apocalyptic fiction, so after reading all the positive reviews and seeing the awesome price for the omnibus edition, I pounced right on this. I'm so glad I did. The first story would be a masterpiece all by itself. It literally left me open-mouthed the brutal twists at the end. I thought it would be a hard act to follow, and it took me awhile to warm up to the new characters introduced in book 2. But once I got to know them, I never wanted to leave them. I can't wait for the hinted-at stories of the other silos. I'll definitely be following this author wherever he leads.
