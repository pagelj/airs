I'm sorry, but I want an eject button...
First, after a week of use this player seems to work well.  So, why one star? After hooking up the unit and checking it out, I couldn't find an eject button on the remote. Looked everywhere, tried all other buttons for a 'hidden' eject.  Got online, searched everywhere, and found out there isn't one.  I found where a Sony employee stated somewhere on a forum that an eject button made no sense because "you have to go to the player to insert or get the DVD anyway".  Following that philosophy, you also have to turn it on before you can insert a DVD, and you're right there when you remove one, so why have an on-off button.  Same goes for Play, just have a pause/unpause button. As another reviewer said, who would think that today a DVD remote wouldn't have an eject button?  Is it absolutely necessary?  No.  Neither is a remote.  I, however, am one that uses the eject button all the time.  I'm buying two more players tonight for the house, and because of a simple eject button they won't be a Sony.  I'm glad I bought just one of these to test. Apparently I'm in the minority here, and the player does work well, but the engineers at Sony really should talk to a wider range of users before they make decisions.  The lack of an eject button (for me) took this otherwise good player from a 5 to a 1, and the next two I order tonight will be from another manufacturer...
