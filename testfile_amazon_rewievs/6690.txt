Great TV mount for a 1/3 of the price
My dad had no trouble installing the mount. My 46 inch looks great and best of all it was 1/3 of the prices for similar mounts you will find in the big box stores. Have not tilted the TV as of yet but it seems like it is very easy to do. Placed order on Sunday evening and received product Thursday afternoon. I also received my free HDMI. Satisfied customer.
