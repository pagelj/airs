Just what i was looking for... after fixing the graphic drivers!
When i started looking for a laptop the first thing i came to look for is the graphics performance, because i'm a designer and sometimes a gamer. This laptop combines an integrated intel hd 4000 and a 2gb radeon chipset with an i7 processor: Just what i wanted!... or so i was thinking until the app responsible of managing both graphic cards failed to work, and soon i discovered how many people were having the same issues trying to enable their radeon graphics when playing games or 3d applications. Now, i have to say it was a desperate situation for me, for i tried every suggested solution from samsung and other people, it was days, weeks, and a month almost, with no success. But now that's in the past thanks to a new generic driver released by amd, wich is compatible with all models and systems so i highly recommend getting it, specially if you're running windows 8. So, after the change it seems like a totally different laptop, i can't believe how i was thinking on selling it before, now i just can't wait to finish working and start the games!
