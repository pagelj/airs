I have Cuisinart coffeemaker at work that is really great... Actually that is one of the reasons I made this purchase, besides the fact that my wife likes to drink tea and the hot water dispenser is really good. This coffeemaker has more bells & whistles that the one at work, such as the Hot Water Dispenser, which is about the only thing I'm happy about & I don't even use it, my wife does. Yes it makes good coffee, but the programmable timer doesn't work properly and the need to clean indicator light doesn't want to stop blinking, even after cleaning (as instructed in the manual). Like I said, makes good coffee, just don't count on the bells & whistles too much...
