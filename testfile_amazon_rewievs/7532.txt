IMP120D iCarrier Battery Pack
The IMP120D is the perfect battery pack for travelers.  It stores enough juice to charge an iPhone 5 six times which is more than enough for just about any airline flight, even overseas.  It is compact and light weight.  Easy to fit in a laptop bag or pack that can be kept under the seat for easy access. New Trent products are of good quality and made to last for their life cycle.  The battery has a power switch that must be pressed to charge a device and prevents accidentally turning the battery on and causing it to discharge. This switch has three LED's that also act as a power meter. In conclusion, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable power source for traveling.
