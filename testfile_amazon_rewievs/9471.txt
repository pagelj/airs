great purse!
I love this purse! i am so happy with my purchase. I wanted a cute black and gold purse and i was hesitant to purchase a purse online but the bag looked really cute! So i bought it and with great it excitement when the purse arrived my expectations were exceeded. It arrived on-time, if not quicker than I anticipated. It fits quite a lot if you need the space, otherwise it fits your basics just perfectly. The chain handles are a bit heavy but its so cute it doesn't matter, you get used to it and i get complimented on it left and right :)I am very happy with the purchase!
