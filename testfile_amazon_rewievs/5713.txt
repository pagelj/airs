For me, the Pronto has solved the quick pick up of dog hair off of hardwood/linoleum surfaces. (We have six live-in dogsl) I am very thankful I don't have to drag out the canister vacuum every time I see a fluff of dog hair float by. I removed the beater bar because when I vacuumed strip rugs dog hair kept stopping it up. Even with the beater bar, efficiently vacuuming strip rugs was unsuccessful. With the beater bar removed, the Pronto picks up rampant dog hair. It's been great for hardwood stairs. The charge lasts long enough for me to clean a relatively large area. The lift-off hand vacuum is very handy for places the stick cannot reach. It cleans close to baseboards.
