Great!
No need to rehash what has already been said about the BDT210. It does everything I want it to without any hitch. I bought a refurb at a very reasonable price. Perhaps something got fixed in the refurb process, but I don't have any issues with Netflix, or anything else. This, I am happy to say.2-23-12: I think I should note that I realized the refurb was actually a BDT215.2-24-12: Watched a full length movie on Netflix without a hiccup.
