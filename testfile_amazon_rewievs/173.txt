Over half this kit is useless.
First of all no instructions came with the kit like it says.  The yellow pry tools are a cheep plastic and one broke right away, they don't even work to open up the phone, I had to use the flat head screw driver to pry it open.  Speaking of the screw drivers they weren't even the right size.  Besides prying open the phone I didn't even use them for the repair and had to run all over town to try and find a screwdriver small enough.  Really the only thing that were of use in this kit was the screen and the adhesive, the rest is completely useless.
