Excelent, not just for Halo fans!
I have to admit im very biased towards military sci fi.  Its hard for me to review this book without mentioning Starship Troopers and Enders Game (which are oustanding), Fall of Reach is in the same vein and it has and excelent flow, the pages just keep turning themselves. To be perfectly honest I found that the game seriously lagged at the end, but this book most definately does not, it helps to put the whole Halo universe in perspective and it's a fun read, it could just as easly stand on it's own.
