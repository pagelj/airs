After doing much research and having a  Cuisinart that had a hot plate that nearly burned down our house we decided to buy the Bonavita. It has impressed us and we will never go back to a hot plate. I love that it is very simple and easy to use. My husband has mastered our favorite brewing strength and we get an amazing tasting cup of coffee every time. I like that it doesn't have a million settings and that we do not have to leave it on/keep it plugged in to keep the coffee warm. The carafe keeps the coffee nice and hot for five hours. I was shocked to see steam coming off my carafe coffee hours after we made it! It's nice to be able to place the carafe on the table and have it handy for refills. Cleans up easily and is ready to go again. I don't have to carry dripping grounds because the part that holds the grounds detaches and can be taken to the compost. We just really enjoy have such a simple, easy to use coffee maker!
