The easiest screen protector ever sold...
I've put my share of screen protectors on electronic devics... ipods, ipads, iphones, and now my kindle fire.  This is by far the easiest to apply screen protector I've ever purchased.  Have you ever gotten a screen protector lined up only to get a bunch of little bubbles in the middle of the screen.  This your solution!  Line up the black edges and apply.  No bubbles!  I promise.  Trust me, I had my doubts about this claim, but it really does work.  This is a great product!
