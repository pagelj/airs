Unlocked, very light, low price + webOS
Great phone overall. Pros:- It is very light! ,- responsive,- has a very good OS (webOS),- can be used as a USB stick (8GB),- and more importantly, is unlocked.- The price really doesn't do this phone right,- and the build quality is nice. Cons:- There aren't as many applications as you'd like on the palm store (skype/netflix... are absent).- No support for google music, iTunes, Amazon cloud music, etc... So the available (non-expandable) memory will have to suffice.- webOS is a dying OS. HP seems to be giving up on it. In any case, updates for the pixi have been stopped for a while, long before HP gave up on webOS for mobile.... that's about it for now. I haven't had the chance to test the battery life yet. FTR, when I received the phone, I wasn't prompted to enter/create my palm account. I couldn't go into the appstore, or update the phone. I did reset the phone, and turned it back on with a T-mo sim card. Only then did I create an account, and was then able to go into the appstore. It seems to me that the phone might have been returned by someone else before I got it. Maybe not. The problem seems solved now. More importantly, note that a reset did not cancel to unlocking of the phone (a major concern initially). It seems to me that this phone beats any other unlocked phone that costs less than 200$. Happy shopping.
