Censored!
Do NOT buy the VHS version of this film if you want to see the film that Catherine Breillat intended to make. It is cut, edited, in other words, censored. It's not just that the graphic sex scenes are cut and that much can be left to the imagination; it's that the cuts eviscerate the film.  Breillat made the film in anger, and her anger is most evident in the explicit sexual scenes that were cut. What's left is drivel. I plan to ship it back for a refund.
