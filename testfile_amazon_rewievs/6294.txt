Sturdy and attractive stand for MacBook Pro
The stand is sturdy, attractive and will elevate the computer to eye level.  Unfortunately in my case, though, the amount of elevation was too great as I had intended to have the laptop screen elevated so that it was next to my Apple Cinema HD display.  Owing to how Apple placed the jacks on the 17" MacBook Pro, though, it was impossible to put the laptop monitor flush against the side of the Apple Cinema HD display; no matter what the choice was to have either the laptop power cord in front of the larger display or the video out, USB 2 and Firewire 400 cables (all are required to run the Apple Cinema HD) in front of the screen.  If you are looking to get the stand for the same reason that I was you will need to find something that raises the back of the laptop 3" or less.
