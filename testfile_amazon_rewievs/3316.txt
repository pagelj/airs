wonderful story
very good book, christian fictions take the stories from the bible and turn them in to something so real to readers. To me it shows the stories from the bible did have real people and real hurts and happiness. I would definatley recommend this book, however my favorite book(s) are the Liz Curtis Higgs series Thorn in my Heart, Fair is the Rose, and Wence came the Prince. The story of Jacob,Leah and Rachel.
