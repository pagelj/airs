Best headphones ever!
Before I got these headphones, I hated earbuds. I mean, I hated them. Talk about ears feeling uncomfortable! Seriously- it felt like I was jamming rocks into my ears. But these earbuds are nothing like that! They are designed to fit comfortably in your ears and they produce excellent sound. Also, the price is by far the most reasonable I've ever seen. Another thing that I like is the fact that the cord is a decent length. I'm 5'1, so my arms aren't extremely long; but I know that with many headphones, I either get a cord that I'm tripping over as I walk; or (what's more likely), I get a cord that's so short, that when I go running, I yank my headphones out as I move my arms. Not cool. Once I got these headphones, those problems were solved. I think I've purchased like 4 more pairs just in case something happens to a pair or I lose them or something. However, my sister stole one pair from me- a testament to how good they are. And since I purchased them, both of my roommates got them as well. Try them, you won't be disappointed!
