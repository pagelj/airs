Wife loves it
My wife wanted a camera like this for a while so I broke down and surprised her with this.  She loves it.  It takes great pictures, fast compared to our old point and shot, takes a little getting used to looking through the viewfinder instead of on the screen.  Looking forward to buying some other lenses to be able to shoot different distances.  I bought this based on recommendations about great pictures and easy to use because we will not be getting into serious photography and could use this easily right away.  Still a lot to read about and learn but so far its been great.
