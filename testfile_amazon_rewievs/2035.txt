Very nice player with a few annoyances.
This player does a fine job of playing DVDs or Blurays. The discs load very quickly. The timer that is on the front of the player is very bright. I have not found a way to dim it yet. It is so bright and distracting during a movie that I may have to block it until the movie is finished. The App section of the player can be compared to a Roku which I have. The Apps load very slowly compared to the Roku. Once loaded they are all almost identical. I browsed around a few that are not on the Roku - Bravo and Discovery Channel - and was unable to find any full episodes to watch. Either it said no episodes available or just clips were available. The web browser with the remote reminded me of my old Web TV from years ago. You really have to use a wireless keyboard and mouse to use the browser. Even then you will be limited as the browser has no java, active x or any online purchasing/shopping. I may order the keyboard and mouse combo but not sure if the expense is worth it for such a limited browser. Overall it is a big improvement from my other bluray players. I will provide updates as I use it over the next few weeks. UPDATE - I have tried to watch videos from CBS, ABC, NBC and Hulu. Only CBS videos would play and with problems. I watched a full episode of "Criminal Minds" but during the show the screen saver kept popping up. Apparently the web browser will activate the screen saver if the remote is not used for about 10 minutes. The next day I tried to watch a full episode of "CSI" and the player turned off twice during the show so I gave up. The videos did look very good when they played. The web browser is not a good substitute for any other device but if you are bored I guess you can spend some time using it. UPDATE: The remote has glow in the dark buttons! And the blurays that I have watched so far look much better then my other bluray players.
