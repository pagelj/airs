Great pen, keep track of the pen nibs too!
Boy, is this thing ever awesome! It's loved more than the 11th doctor's screwdriver.  The pen feature is particularly nice, lights up too when you use it.  The battery compartment is a bit tricky as others here have indicated, but not so hard an 11-year-old couldn't manage it.  Get this for your Dr. Who fan - it's just really, really cool and durable even for the youngest fan. Highly recommend!
