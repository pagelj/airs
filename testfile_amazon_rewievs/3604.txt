Great stand
Called company to confirm what I would be doing with this stand and they were not only helpful but knew my set-up better than I did.  This stand is solid, heavy and works just great.  No wiggle or movement at all from teh monitors.  I am using a 24" Viewsonic and a 19" viewsonic so the mismatch in monitors worried me at first... no problems just put everything together and follow the instructions and 1 hour later and you are up and operating. Starting to look like NASA in here!
