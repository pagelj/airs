We've been using this microwave for a week now and it's basically like any other microwave out there - it heats and defrosts, etc... it's not rocket science when it comes to microwaves. I chose this over other more expensive in-cabinet compatible microwaves for the cost and high Amazon reviews. The Pros:- Large- Quality- Nice trim kit available for in-cabinet installationThe Cons:- Loud (although I don't know how quiet/loud other microwaves of this size are - the other microwave we had was much smaller- Controls can be a bit confusing for advanced functions (but hey, I'm no microwave expert)
