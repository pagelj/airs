I live in a second floor apartment with a young toddler in a building that does have one washer and dryer, but are neither very good and cost a total of $2.50 for one load. I bought this in the hopes that it will relieve me from having to run downstairs frequently, leaving my little one alone. I have had this for about two months now and I absolutely LOVE IT! Sure it holds less, sometimes it can be noisy during a spin cycle for a heavier than normal load for maybe 10 SECONDS at the most, but regardless it has been one of THE BEST purchases I've made. It has really simplified my life and has allowed me to keep my child under watchful eye. I've no leak issues, instructions were easy to follow, and an easy put together. LOVE the easy pop on and off hose adapter thingy too. The only very minor issue I take with it, is the spout where the water comes out... if I already have the water going full blast from the faucet, waiting for me to hit the button to begin filling, the sponge located inside the spout can be pushed out by the rush of water. However, if I am paying attention , it usually doesn't happen. It's an easy fix though if it does, just push it back in.
