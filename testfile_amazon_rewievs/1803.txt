Excellent Value
This product is excellent.  It is small and compact, but it delivers phenomenal sound that you can hear in other rooms.  I was using another external speaker for my iphone, but I never felt like there was enough power and the sound would rattle if the speaker volume on my phone was turned all the way up.  This product can easily handle the output from my phone and provides excellent sound.  It's small and portable and once the battery charges, you can use it without the aid of an outlet.  I would recommend this to other users.
