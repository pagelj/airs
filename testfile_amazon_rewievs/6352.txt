Oh Yeah.. give me more!!!!!
This is such a wonderful book. I wish that all series creators did it this way. I came to know the characters; I cried with them, laughed with them and at times I yelled at them.. but at all times I loved them.  Thank you so very much.. I can't wait to read the rest.  I have the next two and I am diving in, even as I write this..... I am have to say.. you have joined my "favorites" list.. right near the top... Deirdre M Abbott
