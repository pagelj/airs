excellent variation of "Ender's Game" style youth in military story
I don't want to limit this book by making the "Ender's Game" comparison, but it is the elephant in the room.  "Ender's Game" was about training kids to be officers.  This is about aliens training Earth kids to be grunts and cannon fodder - groundtroops.  The worldbuilding is very solid - the author has clearly thought through many of the details of how various alien races would work (and maneuver against) each other in a political system called a Congress. I've only read it the once (and I do plan to read it again), and I'm sure there's political and social sub-themes going on in this book, but you'll be so carried away by the plot and characters that it will just tickle the back of your brain on the first read.  I have not bought the sequel yet because I have too much work to get done in the next few weeks, and I know that if I had the sequel on my Kindle, that's all I'd want to read.
