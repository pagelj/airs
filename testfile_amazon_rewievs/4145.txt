Just an appetizer
I purchased the Wool Omnibus on sale on Black Friday and I have to say that this series is pretty amazing. Hugh Howey is now on my list of favorite authors. Offering the first Wool book for free is a brilliant move because you WILL purchase more after reading this one.  Drop whatever you're doing and download this short story.  It's FREE and it's very, very well written with a plot that grips you. And it only gets better as the series progresses.
