I HATE POP-TARTS!!
I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse. But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time. These things are YUM!
