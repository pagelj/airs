Sharp when new, but blunt after a few uses
I'm not sure how the other reviewers are managing the sharpness, but these knives need to be constantly sharpened to maintain a decent, usable edge. I suspect a lot of the reviews were written after the first use. Out of the box, these work great, but after a few days, they're not nearly as good. The knives, though, are beautifully constructed (for the price), feel solid and hold sturdy. However, due to the need of constant sharpening, I do not see myself using this set beyond a year.
