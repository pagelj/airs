Husband's gift
This was a gift for my husband. He enjoys watching movies at night in bed. He has a large collection of DVD's . He has them catalogued and stored in zippered collection books. This is the 3rd. portable cd player I have purchased for him over the last ten years and the best one. It should last a lot longer because it seems to be a better machine. What counts,is that it brings him hours of pleasure.
