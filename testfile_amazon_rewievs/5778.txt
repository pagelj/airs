I never knew I always wanted these
I had a Chicago cutlery knife block for years and sharpened it regularly. I've bought various knives invidivually that I've liked. My husband gave these to me for an anniversary gift and I was stunned at how well these knives work. Using them is almost effortless and I love the nonslip handles. Truly a beautiful set too, beats a wooden knife block any day. The only downside to the gorgeous look is that they can't be stored under an upper cabinet, there isn't enough room to pull the knife straight up and out. I don't have a gourmet kitchen though so maybe that's just my issue. :)
