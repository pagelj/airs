Love them!
I haven't used them for very long but the few times I have used them, they've been incredibly easy to use.  I think they look nice too.  I just wish they would've come with the wood block for storage, but I'll get that later I guess.  The scissors cut through chicken like a hot knife through butter.  Can't wait to use them again.  And they arrived very quickly after I ordered them.
