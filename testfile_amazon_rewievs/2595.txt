Well balanced, holds enough
I purchased this just prior to a trip to Europe in May and boy was I glad to have it.  I followed other's advice about not zipping to the top, so I had no problems with the zippers opening, although, I'm not sure I would have, they are very sturdy zippers.  I was most impressed by the capacity and loaded weight.  It is very well balanced.  I carried my Canon, with two lenses, plus my Sony video camera, all the extras (batteries and chargers, etc).  I had it quite loaded, but it was easy to carry.  Highly recommend this backpack.
