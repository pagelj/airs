Hoover Platinum Lightweight Upright Vacuum with Canister, Bagged, UH30010COMI bought this vacuum on the strength of the reviews since we did not have this model in our local stores.  DO NOT BUY this if you have even moderately plush carpet.  The product works fine on the hardwood floor and on my two very flat oriental rugs but I have to push and pull it HARD to get it to vacuum the  medium to short cut pile bedroom carpet. Unfortunately I kept it past the warranty becasue I was so delighted with the performance on the hardwood and I was not bothered by the noise at all.  But now after 2 months of shoving it through the bedroom carpet I wish I had brought it right back.  I called a Hoover dealer who told me that no vacuum product can really self adjust.  All those statements are hogwash.  So if all you have or ever want is flooring go ahead and get it but if you think you will ever want a nice carpet, get another vacuum.
