smart oven toaster from breville
it does a great job of toasting various breads.  i have not yet baked anything in it.  however, the broiler aspect is disappointing. to broil one is asked to put the food on the topmost level. however, as the fat gathers under the meat, it starts giving off sparks that are worrying. in one instance i then moved it down to the next lower level.  the sparks stopped but the meat did not have the "broiled" look. the top level is too close to the heating elements which is what causes the sparks.  they should have allowed 1 inch more in height to accommodate this.
