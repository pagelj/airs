Very pleased with the music
Lots of great music for those who enjoy science fiction movies and TV shows. I could have skipped the special effects but those were created by the orchestra so it really is part of the ensemble. There were a couple of places where the sound was very low but the rest of the piece was booming. So either turn your volume up for 10-30 seconds and then back down or just expect some quiet until the full orchestra begins to play. I have other music from the Prague Orchestra and they do an outstanding rendition. The huge amount of music for the reasonable $20 was an added incentive.
