unbelievable deal
Hard to believe you can get such a great product and shipped to your house for so little money.  Wish i would of known about amazon years ago when I bought my first flat screen tv and paid $80 for a 3 ft. monster cable at circuit city.  This is well worth the money and can't tell difference from $80 cable I have.
