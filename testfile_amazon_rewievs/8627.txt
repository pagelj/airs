Not worth it
This product WAS very cheap, so I didn't expect much.  I ordered it because I had free shipping anyway so I thought why not.  The product is poorly made and the box it comes in looks like the directions were written by a 5 year old.  The mirror part is cool but when you turn the phone on it distorts the color and turns your phone into a hard-to-read rainbow.  Not even worth the 2 dollars.
