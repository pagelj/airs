I bought this vacuum in February and have used it regularly for months.  It's been functioning as my primary (and only) vacuum until I get a belt replaced on a full-sized vacuum.  Frankly, I haven't been very motivated to do so because this little thing works so well.  It's extremely light so I've been whipping it out of the closet a LOT more often than I ever did with the old one.  It just feels more portable and easier to use.  I use the stick attachment and run it along the top of my baseboards when the dust becomes visible.  I also vacuum up crumbs, dirt, dust bunnies, hair, lint, even cobwebs and maybe some spider eggs, and I have yet to have any problems.  I moved about a month ago, and I had this thing by my side the entire time, sucking up piles of dust that had been collecting under and behind furniture for years.  I emptied the vacuum once during that entire process (and hadn't emptied it for several weeks prior to that use).  The dust compartment IS small but it's not tiny and you can certainly get a good amount of vacuuming in before it has to be emptied. I do think it works better on hard surfaces and seems a little less effective on carpet, especially the thicker the pile.  I plan to get my large vacuum working again at some point but when I do, it will probably be mostly for carpet and I'll keep this stick vacuum in the pantry for kitchen and hardwood floor vacuuming, which it does very, very well.
