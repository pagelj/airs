NIKON 18-105 mm
Came with my D7000 kitGood image quality  between f5.6 and f11, decent accurate focusing in good light at medium and  close distances, very inaccurate focusing at long distances tends to front focus. For infinity setting is better to manual focus and move the ring all the way, other wise it will front focus at long distances.
