THE WIPES WERE SHIPPED TO ME DRIED OUT.
I PAID ALOT FOR THESE WIPES.  THEY ARE ALREADY LOOSING THEIR MOISTURE.  BARELY THERE AND I AM VERY DISSATISFIED.  BY THE TIME I GET TO THE REST OF THE BOX I FEAR THEY WILL BE NOTHING BUT DRY PAPER. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY RESPONSE FROM THE COMPANY !!!  BUY ANOTHER BRAND.  HOW COULD THEY SELL THIS PRODUCT ???  THEY MUST HAVE OR BETTER HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR PRODUCTS.
