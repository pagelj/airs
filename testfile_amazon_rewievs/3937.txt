say good bye to slow charging - update
Returned for a different product.... This adapter is replacing a different DC charger that practically drained the iPhone while using maps and navigation in the car.  This new charger is amazingly fast and I can now travel without worrying about getting lost or loosing power to my iPhone. Works great. Update after 1 week....  This charger worked at first for my Apple products but later that week, it started to not always provide a charge to my Apple devices.  I returned it for a different supplier items.
