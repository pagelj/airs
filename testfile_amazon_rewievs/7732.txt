This product is great so far! I use it in my room i am 14 and i have pretty much made my room into a bachelor pad. I also ordered the Haler Mini Fridge. This Microwave can cook pretty much any snack like popcorn, super pretzel, tortillas and more. The packaging was great, i didnt have a problem with it. The only thing i did have a problem with was that there was a sticker that they put on it that covered up the whole door and it took me about 30 minuets to an hour to get off and i had to go but this liquid stuff called "goo gone" to get it fully off, but its no biggie. Over all its great!
