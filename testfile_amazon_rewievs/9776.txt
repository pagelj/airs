Adequate for the job.
It does an adequate job. The assembly instructions are a bit off, but easily enough to figure out. This does hold the heavy big screen but it's not really built very sturdy. The last wall mount I had for a TV this size was about twice the weight and the material was about twice as thick. But.... this does do the job and it's certainly priced right. It does include some items which I didn't use such as a bubble level. The problem with the level is that it's about 3" long and not very accurate due to it's length. I used a standard level and it worked just fine.
