Great flash in a small package
I am relatively new to the digital world, have converted from film cameras two years ago. My big problem was with the built in flash on my digital Nikon. While good for most applications, definitely not sufficient for portraits, weddings or any other application where control of the light is an issue. This flash has a great range and because it has a bounce feature makes it ideal for many situations where diffusion, or red eye, or reduction of shadows is needed. It also is economical to operate and a set of batteries lasts a good long time.
