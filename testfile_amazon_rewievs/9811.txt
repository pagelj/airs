Bad vendor - BUYER BEWARE - Founderdirect
Bought this phone from buyer founderdirect without realizing I was not buying from Amazon. The phone is defective as confirmed by Panasonic who told me to return it. After arguing with the company they now want to charge a 20% restocking fee for a defective phone.... Amazon fixed the problem which shoould not have existed in the first place. Summary stay away from Founderdirect and buy from Amazon directly.
