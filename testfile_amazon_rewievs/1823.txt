Season of the Harvest: a taut, tense thriller that puts the reader in the middle of the action.
What could DO that to a man? Such were the thoughts that were brought to mind as I began to read "Season of the Harvest" by Michael R. Hicks.  Hicks is a consummate story-teller, using superbly written prose and dialogue to transport the reader into a world where what would seem to be impossible, on the surface, lives and breathes in the reality that he creates. In the opening pages, FBI agent, Sheldon Crane, is in an intense fight for his life. But what is it that pursues him, impervious to all the firepower he can muster?  And what is it that leaves him, dead and vivisected in such a way as to make the coroner's work nearly unnecessary?  The evidence certainly does not suggest a fight that he or his best friend and fellow FBI agent, Jack Dawson, have experienced.  And Jack Dawson has been around, including a stint in Afghanistan that haunts his days and nights. But Dawson is left push through to the heart of the matter, losing more friends and, possibly, his career along the way.  What do crazed UFO websites and genetically modified seeds have to do with the chaos and bloodshed?  Is anyone who they seem to be? Hicks spins a tale that is riveting for its taut pace, accumulative tension and characters who are real and ever-so human.  Well at least most of them are... Ah, but to tell more would be a crime against those of you who should read it and fall captive to its spell.  It's as if Dave Robicheaux joins the X-Files; like Raylan Givens was assigned to Area 51.  Be prepared, readers, for fast-paced, mysterious and thrilling read.  I'm sure you, like me, will be coming back for more.
