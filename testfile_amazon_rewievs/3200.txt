The Apple Ipad Is Turly Amazing
The Apple Ipad Truly Amazing  Just about two months ago I earned my Apple Ipad 2. It took forever to save up 600$ but is was worth it! I am able to do so much on it I am able to read, play games, go on the internet etc. One thing that i enjoy is the screen is very clear, I personally don't have any problems reading or seeing anything!  One thing that I enjoy to do in my Ipad is read quotes and sayings. I love how fast i can save them. My computer takes forever to download things like that. All you have to do is push one button and you are done!  One other thing that i love about the Apple Ipad 2 is that you can set up a lock so nobody can get into it (like my little brother). I am the only one that can get into it! I love it.  I think the ipad 2 is truly amazing! You can do so much on it. You can do the same things that you can on a computer, maby more! there is really nothing I dislike about the Ipad 2. Also I don't have any problems doing, seeing, hearing anything! I think the Apple Ipad 2 is amazing for anyone and everyone who loves reading, playing games, and going on the internet. Any age!
