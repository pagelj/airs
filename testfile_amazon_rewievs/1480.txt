Perfect for my needs, simple to use, small & mighty
I needed a large capacity battery pack that would charge via USB so that I could use it with my solar panel (Instapark 10W Portable Solar Charger).  It needed to be able to charge up my iPad and other, smaller devices. So far, so good.  I have successfully charged the battery using computer USB and using the solar panel, and I have also used it to bring my iPad from 40% charge up to 80% WHILE I WAS USING IT to watch video and play a game... then I unplugged it from my iPad and into my iPhone 4s and got from 60% charge to about 80% charge on that.  I stopped using the battery after that, but there was still some charge left in it, I'd estimate only about 10-20% however, and I didn't want to drain it all the way.  The battery got slightly warm as it was in use, but not even as hot as your cell phone gets when you're on a long call. I had previously purchased and returned an Anker Astro3 battery pack because it would not charge via solar... same capacity but that battery struck me as a power hog... this RavPower battery does everything I need and it's actually a bit smaller, and I believe it was a bit cheaper.  I have no idea how long this will last, especially if I overheat it in the summer trying to use it for a solar battery, but for now it does precisely what I need it to do.
