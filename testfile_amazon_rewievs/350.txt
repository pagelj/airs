My solution
Before I purchased this lens I had a problem. All I had was the lens that comes with the digital rebel. While it is nice in many ways but I noticed it was horrible for indoors photos with lower light levels, and I can't stand how photos look with flash. So I decided I could buy a massive new flash attachment which would probably solve the problem but I didn't want a big new device attached to my camera. My other solution was to look for a len with a lower f/stop. I didn't want something cheap and plastic but I also didn't want to spend $1000 or more. This lens was the best answer. I can now take low light shots indoors and outdoors very quick and without a tripod. Plus the bokeh or background blur looks great. You really have to see it to understand, the difference between the default lens and this one is tremendous. The only sacrifice I had to make is the fixed 50mm zoom. For the price it would seem the lens should be variable length. The only other lens I could find that goes as low on the f/stop was somewhere around $1500. I'd rather buy a newer camera than shell out that kind of money. Anyways this lens kicks ass, even with the fixed zoom, I primarily only use this lens. If you are in the same situation I was I would recommend this lens.
