This series is doomed
The first three books were fantastic. You know why? Stuff happened. Now Martin is too lost in his own mythology. I used to worry if Martin would ever finish the series. Now I wonder if that might not be a good thing. I hope the series gets back on track and doesn't keep us waiting 5 years for another book where nothing happens. As it is, I'm starting to lose all faith in what started as a very promising series.
