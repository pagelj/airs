Good for the form factor, great for the price.
I would be really cool if it would register itself as a sound card through the USB connection on my computer but then it would cost more and I would probably be too cheap to buy it. I like the replaceable battery. The sound overall is really good, the bass won't blow you away. Beats the heck out of an X-Mini but, as the size of the unit increases that could be expected.
