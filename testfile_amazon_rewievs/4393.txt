Updated 10/2009:  This really WAS great (while is lasted)!
I can't believe how great this toaster/egg maker really is.  The egg sandwiches are so easy to make.  Everything is ready at the same time and there is little clean up.  You always wonder about "gadgets" but this one is a gem.  Highly recommended! Update 10/09:  Well this toaster has not turned out to be as great as I thought it would be.  The egg portion worked great for a year then quit (just after the warranty expired!) Today the toaster element died.  I expected to get more than 2 to 3 years out of a toaster.  I will not buy this again.  It was great while it worked but not worth filling up the land fills every 3 years with broken toasters.  What ever happened to durability?
