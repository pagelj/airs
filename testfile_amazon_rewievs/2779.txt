Great point and shoot and great telephoto lens
For some situations there is no substitute for being able to zoom in close. That is where this camera shines! I captured a great photo of a friend because I could zoom in. She was on the beach capturing photos of huge waves. I captured her and the wave. She loved the shot so much she made it here i. d. photo on Facebook. The image stabilization is the ideal complement to the zoom. I never thought I would be able to, but I can hand-hold at full zoom and get a sharp picture. I put a 6 gb card in it and have all the capacity I need. I can shoot an hour and a half of video. I can freely use the continuous photo feature to capture the peak of wave splash and discard the ones I don't want. Another feature I am liking is one which reduces contrast. It is hard to get a shot of beach, ocean and clouds that does justice to all three elements. HDR does not work well in that circumstance, because I can't get the wave to hold still! But I get some really nice shots when the camera lightens the dark spots and darkens the light spots a bit. Now I can bracket exposures, finish the contrast improvement in software and have a beautiful picture. Ok, so I am not making three-foot posters and the image would probably be very grainy if I did. There must be some distortion in the corners, too. But for $400 I am getting a lot of fine photos for my purposes and I did not spend $6k for a lens that will not get as close... better quality, yes, but not as highly magnified. I tried the Nikon P100 first and returned it. This one is a keeper. I sometimes hit the button to reduce the zoom temporarily when I do not want to, but I am learning to avoid that. I wish I could remove the memory card without taking the quick-connect adapter off the bottom of the camera. I could also use something to remind me to take the camera along when I am walking out the door :-).
