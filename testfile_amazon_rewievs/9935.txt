Just got this yesterday. Used it several times with satisfying results. Note:  The five stars are for the oven.  I find product ratings based on seller service are useless when I'm trying to decide whether to buy something.  I'd like to comment that, in the case of Abt, the service was excellent.  Despite the free shipping for this large, heavy box, the oven arrived satisfyingly quickly.  The outer box was impeccable, and the inside was well padded.  Abt's return policy is also fair.
