This Christmas I wanted a new coffee maker and searched high & low for the best!! I thought I wanted a Capresso 437.01 Elegance 8-Cup Digital Thermal with a thermal crafe- So we got one!! BUT those only hold about 8 cups, which really works out to be be about 3 - 4 regular cups. The coffee did not get hot enough!!!  We did NOT like it at all!! So the search continued!!! Then we found this Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central Coffeemaker. THIS coffee pot has so many great features!!! YOU can set the warmer on it's own setting so the coffee does not burn after an hour. It has a water filter and if holds 12 CUPS!! It gets real HOT-so it brews a perfect cup!!! The look is so great too!! It beeps 5 times after the coffee is made and it beeps when it auto shuts OFF!! WE LOVE IT!!!
