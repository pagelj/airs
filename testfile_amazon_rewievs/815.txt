I've owned this for 6 months.  I had difficulty attaching the body to the head as it never seemed like it clicked into place and I couldn't push it in any more.  A few weeks ago the head fell off and when I was pushing it back on, the neck piece broke.  Now it can't be used at all. while it worked, it worked great, but they need to rethink the connection at the bottom
