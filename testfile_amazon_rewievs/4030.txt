A great camera for those stepping up to digital SLR
I decided to step up from pocket-friendly digital cameras to the Canon EOS Rebel T3i, and I'm glad I did.  This is a great camera for the beginner, but it also has an incredible number of intuitive features.  It has made me want to learn more about photography.  I love this camera.
