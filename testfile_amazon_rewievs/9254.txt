Replaced my hoover vac with the Shark. Its kinda scary how much dust and pet hair this vac is still pulling out of the carpet after several cleanings. Havent used all of the attechments yet but everything seems to work great on the Shark. Snaps together easily and no tools required. Unit was also delivered a day ahead of schedule!
