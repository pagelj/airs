50 shades of Wolves
This book is a bit of nonsense, but it really got me in.  Sometimes I found myself wondering why I was bothering, but I really couldn't put it down.  It's a bit "50 Shades of Grey" although nowhere near as tacky and graphic and a lot better written. It was a free book and I am not sure I would pay to read another instalment..... but I might?
