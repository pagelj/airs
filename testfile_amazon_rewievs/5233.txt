Dark screen!
My twin two year olds loved this toy when we first got it, but seem to be growing bored with it because they are gettting frustrated with the screen being too dark. You can't see the images on the screen but can tell that there is something there, and there is no brightness adjustment. I contacted customer service and they were not supportive at all. They sent me a very brief email just basically telling me that I was out of luck. I was disappointed with the toy, but more disappointed with poor customer service.
