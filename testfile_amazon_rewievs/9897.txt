Very Impressive Quality
I purchased this screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Similar products at the AT&T retail location where I got my phone were much more expensive, so I decided to purchase at Amazon and wait a day or two to receive the product. Previously I've installed a competitor's product from my Gen 1 and Gen 3 iPads.  The version for my Gen 3 iPad is pretty disappointing.  It blurs the retina display enough to make it virtually indistinguishable from the Gen 1 iPad display.  It also started to peel near the home button, so it was a waste of money. At the same time I got the S3, my wife went with an iPhone 5.  She purchased her screen protector at the AT&T store, and it claimed to be HD, specifically for the retina display of the iPhone.  That screen protector shows the same fuzziness and distortion that my iPad 3 screen protector shows. The screen protector for my S3 is pretty unbelievable.  There is simply no distortion or fuzziness.  My wife even commented on how nice the pictures and backgrounds look on the display on my phone. Installation was very easy, too.  I didn't encounter any of the troubles I did with the iPads where I would have to start, stop, peel off, reapply, rinse, repeat.  I was able to put the protector on in one attempt, and got back to using the phone quickly. I'm very impressed and highly pleased with this screen protector. I just wish I had found tech armor products prior to using the other screen protectors on my other gadgets.
