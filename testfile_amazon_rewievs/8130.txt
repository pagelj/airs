Perfect height, perfect, just perfect
The packaging is great, no waste inside the box, it came covered with just enough paper for it to not get damaged and not have to throw away tons of paper, and the height the screen is placed at is just right. There's nothing bad I could ever say about this product, it stands still, it doesn't shake or move, comfortable view point, MUST BUY.
