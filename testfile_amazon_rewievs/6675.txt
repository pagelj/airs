Acceptable product for the price.
I bought three of this model for work cars after reading many reviews on different dash cameras. I found the day footage and night footage of lit areas to be good. Night footage from darker areas or no headlights is grainy, but you can still see and make out images when reviewing. The bad part of the product is that all three BL-5C batteries hold no charge and fail within a few minutes. I tried what the manufacturer suggested (full charge and drain at least three times) but no improvement. I wrote Amazon and received a credit which I used to by new OEM Nokia batteries  http://www. amazon. com/gp/product/B002EJ94BQ/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00? ie=UTF8&psc=1Another problem has been that the one camera keeps falling off of the suction cup assembly on the windshield. I tried Crazy Glue, but it continued to fall off. Amazon customer service again helped me out by giving me free shipping when I ordered three better mounts that the camera secures too and are higher quality workmanship. http://www. amazon. com/gp/product/B007E4PUT6/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00? ie=UTF8&psc=1
