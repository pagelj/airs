I would strongly recommend this vacuum as it provides a HUGE bang for the buck.  If you want a vacuum that does the job better than most vacuums and is budget friendly THIS IS THE ONE!!! This was the 5th ranked vacuum on consumer reports yet it was less than $70.  The top four vacuums, three of which where hoovers also, where $250-$400.  All four performed the same as the Tempo bu all they had on it is a few bells and whistles.  None of the bells and whistles where worth the extra $180.  This vacuum performs great and I have tested it myself on carpet and bare floors (tile & laminate wood). Consumer Reports was right on with the quality rating. The suction is powerful and it is very easy to use.  My prior vacuum was a hoover with auto drive and a few more bells but this vacuum performs better and is easier to use.  It's brush and suction are the best I've used and it is light enough that it is very easy to push.  Wide path makes for greater coverage and quicker vacuuming. I don't love vacuuming but this one makes it much less daunting.
