You must link it with WIFI. Then, oh man, plenty of movies and videos you can see through it. I use it to see Youtube and Netflix andHollywood movies online, which actually contains lots of Japanese Cartoons, like Slam Dunk, one of my favorite cartoon. it's fast and the sound is great. Some movie has 5.1.
