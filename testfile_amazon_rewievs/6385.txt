I got this set for under $50 which is a good deal considering how many pieces. The pros are the cost, the number of pieces, variety of knives, and a great wood block holder. The negatives are the knives have flimsy blades and need to be sharpened after a couple uses. I bought this cause I am a single guy and didn't have a knife set in my kitchen.  For the value I am very pleased, but would have been happier with stronger blades.
