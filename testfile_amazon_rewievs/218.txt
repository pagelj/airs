Great Deal On A Toslink Cable
Forget the high priced retail stores.  This Amazon branded cable is better quality than the ones sold at your local BB or WM and about a third of the price you'd pay at your neighborhood big box retailer. You can't go wrong with this cable.  Works perfectly on my Sharp Blu-Ray player.  As mentioned in other reviews, just remember to remove the plastic end caps when you hook it up.
