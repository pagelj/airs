A good read, excellent character development, but a bit over-reaching and drawn out
Gets a 4 due to strength of character development.  Doesn't get the 5 because character development goes on and on until the bitter end.  You figure early on the guy is damaged goods.  In the end I think the main character psychotic. The story is a bit convoluted and prolonged to the end.  Strong plot sorta fizzles.  It builds to major battle where you think the enemy is defeated  by a super duper major battle and then the mother of all battles.  Seems to be a trend with shallow scifi writers.  Probably would have been best to have saved the last battle for the sequel. The plot develops into a pretty good scifi yarn.  But where I read word and word the first 50% - 60% of the book, I began speed reading and skipping paragraphs in the latter part of the book.  It descends into what some have label as a harlequin romance.  I tend to agree.  It is unrealistic in the handling of romance.  The relationships become almost implausible in the latter part of the book. Still, one of the better reads I have come across recently.  Just plan on speeding through the latter half of the book.
