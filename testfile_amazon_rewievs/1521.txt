Loved them, until TSA broke them
These are definitely a 5 star product.  I have to buy a second pair now though because I forgot I even had them on while going through screening at the airport, and as a result they just threw the things on the conveyor belt for the x ray machine, and it chewed them up.  Their response?  "I didn't break them, the machine broke them."I had about 2 weeks with them, and in that time I felt so free.  No wires.  Watching movies on my Nexus 7 combined with these was like having my own portable movie theater. I did notice I had to turn off Near Field Communication (NFC) within my Nexus 7 because I had this weird problem where the audio kept having tiny gaps every second or so.  Like someone was just pounding on the mute button as fast as they could, toggling it on and off. I also really liked the phone feature.  You see, you can set these up to work with media audio on a tablet, but do phone stuff on a separate device!  Not only that, but whatever's going on in the media profile will pause while you're on the phone, and resume when you're off, all handled by these headphones. The voice telling you the battery level is such luxury.  It tells you when the battery is low so you don't need to hold down the button like in the 700's. Hopefully I'll come across some money soon, maybe sell a painting or something, and I can afford a new pair.  Unfortunately, mine fell victim to the utter incompetence known as the TSA.
