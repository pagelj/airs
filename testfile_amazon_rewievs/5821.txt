Use it ALL of the time
Best thing I can say about the Griddler is that it never made it to the appliance cabinet where all of the too much of a hassle to use appliances go... and never return. The grill warms up quickly, cooks fast and food like chicken, burgers, pork chops, etc stay juicy and cook evenly. Clean up is quick, the plates are non-stick and the grill has a small footprint.
