Great solution
I looked at I don't know how many camera back packs, carry bags, rolling bags, all kinds of bags.  Based on the reviews I opted for this one.  I couldn't be happier.  Very nice quality bag and well constructed.  Zippers work buttery smooth and the bag seems well padded.  Comfortable to carry and with the chest and waist straps it takes a lot of the weight off the shoulders.  The shoulder straps are nicely padded as well.  The inside swallows a lot of gear.  If your a pro carrying a zillion lenses and speed lights, you will probably not be able to pack it all in, so, buy two. :-)  At 30 bucks a pop I don't think you can beat it.  The inside is configured so you can carry your camera body with a lens attached (long or short) and the velcro partitions can be reconfigured to pack in different size gear.  One caution though, the back is not terribly deep so long lenses will need to go in lying down.
