We have had this coffee maker for exactly 1 year & really have liked it.  We like the temperature adjustable warming plate.  It brews good coffee.  No complaints at all with the product UNTIL NOW.  One morning this week it just plain did not work.  The man at Customer Service at Cuisinart directed us to beef up the vinegar in the vinegar/water mix and try decalcifying.  It still did not work.  No noise, no brewing, nothing.  So, we were directed to ship it back & enclose $10 to cover the shipping cost for the one they are sending to us.  Well, it cost over $20 to ship our broken one back!  This is a $30 cost to replace a $66 coffee maker under the warranty!  We'll withhold final opinions on this coffeemaker until after we have had the replacement for at least a year.  The product is too expensive to break down so soon.
