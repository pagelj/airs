Not pleased- doesn't work for carpets
I ordered this vacuum based off of reviews, but disregarded the ones staring the carpet function worked poorly. I shouldn't have. Let me start with I have a dyson, and I felt it was scratching my hard wood/travertine floors. ALL of my downstairs and all high traffic areas are hardwood or travertine, and I just have one small area rug in my living room. I have two small non shedding dogs and a husky that sheds enough for all of them. It simply moved her hair around on the low pile carpet. It worked great on hard surfaces, but for $300. I want something that works for both. I returned it.
