Kindle Fire HD
I bought the Fire HD 32 MB as an adjunct to my Droid SmartPhone, to add several capabilities:1)  Easily view web content such as FaceBook, etc..2)  View pdf diagrams,3)  Listen to my music,4)  Store and read books while traveling.5)  Secure internet transactions. I was surprised to find that listening to music actually was better via the Fire HD, the Dolby sound really enhanced my music, a great deal of which is theater pipe organ. Wow! Fantastic bass with crystal clear rendition throughout the audio range. This is very impressive. Of course the books are easy to read, I read one the first evening I had the Fire HD just to see how well this worked, actually listened to music while reading! One of the items I checked before buiying the Fire HD was the availability o the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client, the first app I installed was the VPN client, no problems in installing or configuring, flawless operation and the connection is persistent, I can establish it at home (also on the College network), walk to work, and have it reconnect as I get within wireless range of the College. Excellent. This means I can access private financial records, anywhere in the world, and be connected as though I were "on Campus". I am very satisfied with this tablet.
