A journey that goes nowhere
This was not George R. R. Martin's best work. This was not an adventure, this was a journey. Unfortunately, the journey went nowhere. Two-thirds of the book was about half a dozen characters making their way to Daenerys and her dragons. Once they arrived, nothing happens. The other third of the book is filled with profanity and references about sex. Most of the characters in the Dance With Dragons are minor characters that you don't care about and the ones you do care about, like Jon Snow and Tyrion, do nothing. In the middle of the book Martin begins to have some interesting side plots but they never develop. Jaime and Davos just disappear with no mention of where they went. It also seems to be a Song of Ice and Fire theme that no one stays dead. I'm beginning to lose my trust in the author. All in all, I think Martin made his world too big. It's not fun reading a thousand pages of people traveling. I'm sure I will read the next book when and if it comes out, but A Dance With Dragons is dead to me. This one was for the money, not for the fans or for the story. See you in another six years, Westeros.
