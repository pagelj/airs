nice and compact but a bit expensive
Received my DCB304 bag today, and while I'm overall pleased, I felt that I had overpaid--- any price over $10 is high for this bag.  Bag would be ideally-priced between $5-10. The bag barely fits my Nikon p520, a battery, a 32gb memory card, and recharger.  The bottom/base of the bag doesn't have sufficient insulation and so the Nikon camera (resting on its side inside the bag) is not well-cushioned. Thus, when placing the bag down onto the ground or table, care needs to be taken to gently lay the bag down.  Otherwise, the camera will feel any impact/pressure of any bag drop.
