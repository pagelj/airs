Works for the iPad and various accessories
I wanted a small bag for my iPad that would also hold various iPad accessories such as a charger, etc.  This one does the job, and will accept an iPad while the iPad is still in its case, which is what most users want.  There is a side container that accommodates a charger and a few other iPad accessories.  This is a very small case and is a pretty snug fit for the iPad.  It does not have room for the Apple Wireless Keyboard, which I would have liked. The quality of construction of the case is good; it will hold up to use and abuse.  It will also protect one's iPad.  But that is all; it is too small to function also as an attache case.  To the contrary, this case is suitable for tossing inside a real attache case, thereby providing padding and protection to the iPad.  Or you can carry it externally, perhaps over one's shoulder using the supplied strap.  RJB.
