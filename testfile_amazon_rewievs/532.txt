once you get it right, it's great
I will say that I really like that they give you 3 screen protectors, as I went through 2 to get it right.  Turns out I'm not that good at following directions or counting, so I could have had done it with one =PYou simply peel off the tab marked "1", roll it onto the screen, press out all the bubbles, then remove tab "2".  If you try to do it backwards as I did, you will never get all the bubbles out, nor get it to stick, as there is a difference between the 2 sides.  So just pay attention.  Once I got it right, it went on and there wasn't even a need to press out any bubbles.  It is like it's not even there, by far the best screen protector I've used on an iPhone (this is my 3rd iPhone). Highly recommended!
