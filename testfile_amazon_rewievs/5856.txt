Awesome Phone
This is my very first smart phone and I love it. Everyday I am learning something new with it. I dont know much about technology but from the basics that I do know this phone is a great product. It came faster than the time it was given. The one thing that I do not like about it is that I wanted to buy beats headphones for it and before i was going to buy them I tested them to see if they fit. The way the whole is made unfortunately it DOES NOT FIT or any other type of headphones in that matter. I do believe that only basic small headphones for it will work, but other than that I have no complaints about the phone.
