Bought this vacuum about 5 months ago and only use it to clean my one room.  Pros:  1. Good suction  2, Revolving brush head gets my dog's hair up.  Cons:  1. Filter is EXTREMELY difficult to clean  2. Cord storage area is not deep enough., Wrapped cord falls off and unwinds a lot.  3. Crevice tool falls out of storage space easily.  4. The hose is too short to reach all the way under bureau,chest of drawers, bed, etc.
