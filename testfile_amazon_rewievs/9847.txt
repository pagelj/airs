Best one ever
We've gone through lots of toaster ovens.  Its always convenient to have a small oven, and this one is the best ever! Unfortunately, most toaster ovens make it really hard to produce good toast consistantly.  Well, this model solves that for good. Here's the key.  Before you buy a new toaster oven, look at how the device is set to make toast.  Many of these ovens have little knobs you turn or sliding settings.  And they give you some small range between light and dark toast that you have to hit perfect each time. Well, those other toasters make it real tough to get your toast the same each time.  And your bagels, and your frozen waffels if you go that way. This oven has a great digital setting.  I like it at 3 (as in 3 mins) and so you hit toast and set it at 3 (or just leave it from last time) and the toast is perfect every time. I can't emphasize this enough.  This thing makes it so easy not to burn waht you want to eat.  Or not to undercook. And the normal oven features are great too.  The convection is great.  We've been able to quit using our big gas oven for most things.  You can even fit a 12" pizza in this thing! One thing to note is the size.  This unit is deeper than your normal toaster oven.  It'll still fit your counter, but might stick out more than you are used to.  If you have a corner free you might like it there better (at an angle).
