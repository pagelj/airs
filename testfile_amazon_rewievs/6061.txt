Lot of Bubbles
These screen protectors are the same as the rest I have tried. There are lots of bubbles after the protector is applied which can't be removed. It looks simple on their video but trust me it's not. The paper pad they provide to remove the bubbles it just that--a piece of paper. It bends when trying to push the bubbles to the edge and don't use it without putting the cleaning cloth on it or it will scratch the protector. Also the second tab you have to remove has thick adhesive holding it on so you have to scrape it off which will leave scratches where the adhesive was. I junked the first protector I tried because of the bubbles and scratches. The second one is about the same but I left it on since it's an older Iphone 4 that I just use for work. I guess it will protect the original screen until I sell it and upgrade to a new phone. I won't use these screen protectors however. Maybe a Zagg, since I did have good luck with that protector that was installed on the phone when I got it.
