Amazing lens.
I ordered this lens for my Canon 60D. I have shot with this lens in very dark rooms, near dusk with no inside lighting. No flash, handheld and the pictures are amazingly bright and sharp. I love this lens! I also own the f1.8 version (~$120.00) and this lens blows it away in terms of build quality. It's solid and I love the feel of the metal body and construction. The f1.8 version is very lightweight and flimsy feeling (all plastic) although equally impressive in low light. For portraits, the f1.4 has incredible bokeh, much better than the f1.8 version. I have a feeling this lens will be on my 60D alot! Can't wait for my upcoming vacation! Is this lens worth the current $400 price tag? ABSOLUTELY without a doubt. Oh! Please remember, if you are going to use a filter for protection or whatever reason, it accepts a 58mm filter. PLEASE do not buy the cheapo Tiffen or equivalent filter. You risk ruining your pictures. I recommend B&W, Hoya, or Heliopan. This lens DOES have full-time manual focusing which is fantastic! So, if you have it set to auto-focus, you can still safely turn the focus ring to fine-tune your shot without damaging anything. It does NOT come with a bag or hood. Just FYI.
