Nice holster case.
I was displeased with the $40 Lowe holster case that B&H sent with my Canon 50D. I tried another inexpensive (~$30) Lowe case that also did not work well for me. This Caselogic case is just right for my 50D with an 18-200mm lens. Good padding all around and a sturdy rubberized bottom. Very nice case for the $22 and change.
