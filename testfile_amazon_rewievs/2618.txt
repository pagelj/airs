The one i was looking for a decade!!!!!
Perfect, well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of gismoz.. i use it hold my blackberry torch, my wife iphone and also our Garmin on long road trips. Hold very firmly and looks perfect on my car's dash (audi a4). Rigid and tough build, has no problem with installation. just insert it to your CD and tighten the bottom screw to firm the grip. it is very versatile as it can house a wide range of phones. so dont have to upgrade for each and every model they sell. but ofcourse charging part can be tricky.  the cradle can go both portrait and landscape.
