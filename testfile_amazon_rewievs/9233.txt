Pseudo-science fiction
Others have commented on the grammatical issues and plot holes. For a free book, I was not expecting too much. What I couldn't take was the absolutely awful grasp the author had on science. On just one page, you are confronted with two whoppers: guns won't work in space because they need oxygen, and when discussing railguns, saying that space is really, really good at dissipating heat. I just couldn't take anymore. Apparently the author took his ideas about space combat from watching star wars cartoons.
