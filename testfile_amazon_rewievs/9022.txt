My husband and I love this coffee maker. The coffee tastes great, it is easy to program, the warmer keeps the coffee the perfect temperature and we are thrilled with the way it pours - into the cup and not all over the counter. I can't believe it took me so many years to get a great coffee maker!  Worth every penny.
