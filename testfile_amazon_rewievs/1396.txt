WOW!!!!! GREAT LOVE STORY
This book captivated me from the first page. You just absolutely fall in love with these characters. I could not put the book down. Allison is this sweet girl with a tremendous heart, you fall in love with the person that she is.  She is the level headed girl always trying to make the right decisions and help all those around her. Cedric is HOT... and he is a man on a mission. He is torn between what his heart wants to do and what his head needs to do. Now he needs to figure out how to make sense of what he is feeling and how to keep his past from Allison. I love how the author incorporated autism into this book, I am a mom of an autistic child and it was nice to see how Allison interacts with her autistic clients, it actually brought tears to my eyes. I can't wait to see more from this author!!!
