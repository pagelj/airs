This vac is an excellent value. The Quick Up is effective on carpets, which is important to me since most of the floor space in my apartment has carpet. I like that I can switch off the brushroll and clean the bare floor too. The battery easily lasts long enough clean my entire small, 1-bedroom apartment.
