Wonderful, quick read.
It took me less than 24 hours to plow through this book (on my new Kindle!).  The only reason it took me that long was because I have to sleep sometime.  It reminds me a lot of a childhood favorite, The Stainless Steel Rat series by Harry Harrison. For whatever reason, I really prefer 1st person writing.  A fine mix of humor, thoughtful science-fiction and action make this book worthy of a download and a read.  And now I move onto the next book in the series..
