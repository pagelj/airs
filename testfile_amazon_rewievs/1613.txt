Finally...
Owned a graco monitor and got so frustrated with the signal always dropping I had to find something to replace it. With a tight budget I was looking for something in the 150 range. I bought this together with another add on camera which was at the best value I could find. With the infant optics i finally don't have to deal with signal issues. The video quality is better than the graco and the range is fantastic. The batteries don't last that long so I bought an additional power charger from amazon to keep a power dock in both the kitchen and in my bedroom. Overall an excellent baby monitor for the money.
