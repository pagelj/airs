Very pleased with this factory reconditioned Dyson DC-35 cordless vac.  Clearly marked as reconditioned but appeared as good as new. Wanted a cordless had vac that had the long tube for ease in doing quick pickups on the floor or ceiling corners.  Far superior to traditional type of dustbuster.  Easy empty dirt/dust bin.  Seems to hold a charge for a long time.  Shipping and delivery were as estimated.  Packaging excellent.
