Product Engineering and Support lacking
We have owned one of these units for just over one year, when it works its great. However the LCD has now failed which seems a common problem with many references to this issue available here and elsewhere. The unit becomes very difficult to use without the LCD and LCD technology should not fail this quickly under normal use. The only response from Breville is "buy a replacement" and that maybe their response but it will not be another Breville unit. Lousy engineering and pittiful customer support.
