Great Camera
After a fair amount of reviewing different cameras, I was looking for something small I could carry instead of my large DSLR.  This camera was perfect.  With the quality of the pictures, great zoom, and light weight, this is the perfect camera when hiking, skiing, or when you just dont want to carry something big.
