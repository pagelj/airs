Too much technobabble
The characterization was terrible. Only Honor and her executive officer had a little depth. Almost all the other characters had no distinguishing features except their physical description and their job duties. Too much time was spent in the battle descriptions at the end, particularly in the dialogue. Once you strip away the little characterization there is, you're left with spaceship velocity descriptions. I had much more fun reading Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan series.
