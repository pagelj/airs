Great Newphew loves it
Purchased this for my Great Newphews 3rd birthday gift, had it shipped directly to him.  He loves it!  Daddy is always on his lap top working so I bought him one too.  His parents are able to down load from LeapFrog and it has more abilities than was listed on the description.  He can get up to 4 text or email messages on it even!  I LOVE IT WHEN I SEND A GIFT THAT'S A GREAT HIT!!!
