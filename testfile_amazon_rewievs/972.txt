It works
I have a couple of expensive club chairs that are about 15 years old. I was told by the furniture maker that occasional wiping with a damp cloth was all the care needed. Recently, some large cracks and brittleness, especially on the arms, appeared. This product softened the leather and removed most of the dry feeling. I think I have added years of use to these chairs. I only wish I had done this earlier. I did not find it difficult to apply. I warmed the bottle in a bowl of hot water, and rubbed it in with my bare hands. The next morning, I wiped excess easily with a cloth napkin. Highly recommended.
