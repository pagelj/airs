Great Product
Roku provides step by step instructions and is very easy to install.  The device works wonderful and is easy to use.  Previously I used a blueray dvd player to stream content and programs were often interrupted for the device to buffer.  Most of the time I don't have this issue with Roku.  Highly recommend this product for anyone considering a streaming device.
