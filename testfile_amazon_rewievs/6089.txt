Nikon 24-70mm
Ok, so its big. Ok, its heavy. Now for the good part. Focuses faster than any lens I have ever owned. Seems to magically find faces. VERY sharp. Even wide open. I know Ken Rockwell says pros dont use it. But, when you are surfing, looking at some great shots by PROs, there it is listed in the metadata. All over the place. Seems that many love this lens. Goes kinda wide. Goes normal, and a little. Its price is high. All Nikkor gold ring lenses are. Why? They are worth it.
