Comfy, clear, cheap. I ordered from seller "Limited Goods"
These sound awesome, they are small and comfortable. I ordered these along with the similarly priced iLuv earphones, I like them both quite a bit. The iLuvs shipped faster, and the cable is anti-tangle which is awesome, they are also a bit louder then these so if that's important get those, but the rubber buds were uncomfortable, I switched them with cheap ones I bought off ebay a while back and that fixed the problem. These sound just a tiny bit clearer but a bit farther away then the iLuvs. They are both fantastic earphones for the price and I recommend both.
