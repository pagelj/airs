okay for the price
Resolution and sensibility look the same to me.  The color, however, doesn't match 100%, it's a little bit darker than the original one. In addition, my screen arrived with a dead pixel; too much of a hassle to remove this one, get a new one and install it again. (Installment took me like 1 hour)
