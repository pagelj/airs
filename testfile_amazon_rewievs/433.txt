How affordable is HDMI?
This little HDMI cable is so affordable yet does exactly what the very expensive cables cost.  To ensure no interference, I set up the cable about 3 to 4 inches away from any other wires.  The plasma tv picture is flawless now.  So much better than hooking up your tv to the components board.  Well worth it!
