HDMI Cable Not in Package
There was no HDMI Cable in the SEALED package but the manual says one is supposed to be included.  Great quality control on Panasonic's part. Product may be good, but how would I know as I have no connection to the TV.  Returning products is a hassle so I bought a cable from Radio Shack for $25 with tax.  While that wiped out the savings on the item, Amazon credited me for the cost of the HDMI cable,so that moved my rating from 1 star to 3 stars: 5 for Amazon and 1 for Panasonic average of 3. Still annoying!!!!
