For the price, cant be beat
I gave 5 stars because for a knife to work this well at this price point and not be junk is a feat in itself. Can you compare these to knives costing $300 a set? Cutting probably, but construction?  Probably not. How they arrivedThe knives came in a cheap card board box without any writing in plastic generic sleeves, packed with brown paper.  No frills. ConstructionThe knives have a mirrored appearance on the blades. The blades are thin, but I have had no issues cutting, chicken,steak, pork or veggiesThe handles are plastic with texture (tiny bumps, fissures)The knives are very light, but handle fine with the non slip handle grip. SharpnessMost of my knives where sharp. I used steel on the 8" chefs knife and then it was as sharp as the others. For the price point i don't think these knives have any competition. Are the draw backs? Yes. How they workedThe knives are light weight, although I believe they will last. I have used them for one month and I am enjoying them over my wooden handle 15 year old henckles. I do not dish washer my knives, I hand wash them, mirrored appearance is the same after daily useWhen cutting potatoes that were wet I notice the mirrored blade would suction/grab against the potato. That was using the 8 inch chefs knife.  When I used the 6" chef utility, it had no sticking and was like cutting through butter. The bread knife and paring knife are great as well. If you're looking for a cheap sharp knife and can get past that they aren't full tang high quality chef knives then these are for you. Side note, I have the old henckles 4 star? 3 star or less quality wooden handle knives that came with the wooden storage block, these will not all fit in it. The 8" chef knives blade is taller, and the bread knife did not fit into the old 8" utility knife holder. So, if you have an existing knife block these might not fit. I don't have the cash for a $300.00 plus knife set so this is perfect for me.
