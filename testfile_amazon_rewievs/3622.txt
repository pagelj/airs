I've never thought of a vacuum as a capital investment so the well respected Dyson was off the table. Still, my old bagged upright wasn't getting it done and I wanted a bag less machine. I'd been comparing the more modestly priced models for months and could never make up my mind. The variety of features, footprints and price points had me flummoxed. This is the vacuum my housecleaner brought over each visit so I asked him how he liked it. To that inquiry I heard a five minute sales pitch -- he hit on power, durability, tools, filters, ease of use/cleaning and most important to him: value. The vacuum is excellent. It's worth buying if only for the satisfaction of emptying the canister -- a reminder of why I should vacuum and positive reinforcement for having done so. The price point was near the bottom when compared to similar models and I was definitely prepared to spend more -- I'm glad I sought my housecleaners advice (his reward: he can leave his in the truck now). The Bissell Helix maneuvers well, is not nearly as loud as my old bag vacuum and tool use and settings are quite intuitive. The vacuum shipped free and was a breeze to assemble. On top of that, I now have a vacuum suited to ridding my car of dog hair. I can't speak to durability yet, hence the four stars.
