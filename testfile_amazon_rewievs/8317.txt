Finally!
This unit is MUCH quieter and more reliable than previous Xbox 360 consoles... It still produces a massive amount of heat but it now has the exhaust port on the top of the box (laying down) which will better cool the chips as long as you don't cover the vent with a stack of games or something like that.  Also the new touch-sensitive power and tray buttons and extra USB ports (not to mention built-in WiFi and optical digital audio jack) make the Xbox 360 "S" series a definite winner. One note:  If you are any kind of gamer you are really going to want/need the 250GB hard drive... 4 GB is only enough for the casual user: Kinect, streaming Netflix, basic arcade games, etc..  Hardcore gamers should be getting the hard drive and installing all your disc games directly to it:  this will drastically reduce load times and drive noise, as well as generate less overal heat and wear and tear on the game disc.  Also many of my Xbox Live friends that DO NOT have a 250 GB hard drive or greater seem to have a lot of trouble connecting to certain multiplayer sessions and parties, and several have subsequently purchased the HD and found those issues to be erradicated.  I don't know why this is but I have confirmed it myself.
