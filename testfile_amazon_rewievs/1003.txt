Untold water damage and nonoperational equipment
As far as the product, its a good phone with only one issue that it will turn off, and not come back on. When you try and charge it, it won't charge. I have had 2 of these phones with the exact same issue. The seller of this particular product though, failed to mention the water damage and damaged MicroSD card slot. This phone had the aforementioned problem, and does not work either. So, as far as the LG Env3, its a great phone if you can get it to keep working, however as far as this seller. Don't buy from them, you will be disappointed and lose your money.
