Not worth time or effort
I ordered this phone to replace a worn-out Razr that I've had for a few years.  I love my Razr; it's the perfect phone for someone who does not need a fancy iPhone, Blackberry, touchscreen, etc.  I expected a completely brand new phone, unlocked, direct from the manufacturer. The phone was locked (it needed a code) and had a "Refurbished" label.  T-Mobile and Amazon could not help me so I called Motorola.  I provided the MSN and IMEI codes (one-of-a-kind ID numbers assigned in the factory) from the phone, and he said the codes were not in the database, meaning the phone had been sold by a carrier or refurbished. I asked Amazon for a replacement. The replacement phone did not have a "Refurbished" label and did not ask for an unlock code; I inserted my SIM card and made and received calls.  However, the phone has AT&T logos, screensavers, browser links, etc.  While it was technically unlocked, it was not what I expected.  The next morning, all the keys and buttons stopped working.  The phone was a complete dud after less than one day of use. This time I asked Amazon for a refund.  I guess I could ask for a third phone, but I'm sick of this and I found a much better price and warranty on the exact same item at another retailer. This page does not state that this phone may be refurbished, may have carrier branding, or may be locked.  In my experience all of these things were true.  Two different customer service representatives told me that every time they send me a replacement, it is from the same batch that Motorola sold them so it may have the same problems as the phone I'm returning. Bottom line: Amazon admits that, when you order this item, they don't know if you will receive the product described on this page.
