This set was given to me as a gift. They looked similar to the ones I requested, but were of much lower quality (which I don't think the giver of said gift meant to do). At any rate, we've been using them like we would any other silverware. In our house dishes don't always get done immediately. I'm not saying they sit in the sink for days on end, but it may be the morning after before dinner dishes are all washed. I bring this up because we had a busy night recently and the silverware was in the sink until the morning at which point there was already rust on one of the pieces. I will accept some blame, but I know I'm not the only one with less than immediate cleaning habits, so buyer beware. I have two other issues with this product. I have two spoons that bent already from the pressure of scraping ice cream out of a carton. I say scraping because I was not digging for a "scoop" of ice cream, I was just trying to get a couple of tablespoons worth off the top. I know using a tablespoon in place of an ice cream scoop is hazardous, but I was being gentle about it and the bend happened quite suddenly. They are inappropriately flimsy. My last set was a Target special from college days. It was tacky, but I only ever had one break. My last comment regarding these is that they call it a 53 piece set and show you the pieces--mostly. The "steak knives" are so pathetic they are embarrassed to show them or properly describe them. I sincerely believe they went to the dollar store to buy these steak knives in bulk. Thin blades and black plastic handles make this feel like it could give out at any moment. I was really hoping for a set with substance. Now I can't even return them because the one who gave them to me does not "believe in gift receipts". So, on to the next garage sale they'll go I guess. And back to the tacky college silverware for now.
