very nice
I had an oster toaster... which was adequate. I like my toast dark but not burnt.... this was difficult to achieve with the oster. This toaster performs great! The toast doneness setting wheel is accurate and it toasts to the edges! Very attractive and simple. The lift lever works nicer than the oster and the cord feature is wonderful. All for less than the oster! Highly recommend.
