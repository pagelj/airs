Beware of mounting issues
I'll get straight to it then: The back part of the wall mount that connects directly flush to the wall, will only work with 18" (or shorter distance) studs. It is about 20" across. And, you *cannot* use this mount with drywall anchors. You will rip the drywall out and break your TV (I haven't done this, but I can guarantee the weight of the mount + a TV + leverage from full extension will eventually destroy your drywall). If you have 24" studs, you have to go through a lot more trouble: Buy a nice thick board which can easily cover the 24" distance, screw it into the studs, and then mount your TV mount to the board. This is more work, costs more, and is uglier, but at least you can get the thing to mount. You can paint the board, but that's even more money/work. The other problem I had was that the extra bubble level included in the box was smashed to pieces by the sheer mass of the wall mount bouncing around in the packaging. Yes, the mount did not fit its packaging very well. I recommend inspecting it for bending/damage when you get it. Overall, it seems very sturdy, and allows for a lot of horizontal movement flexibility. It is less flexible vertically, and you have to unscrew locking knobs and try to keep it level any time you want to angle it up or down, but the vertical adjustment is there. It holds my 42" Plasma without showing any strain. EDIT: I noticed that the product being sold has a much wider wall support, so it should easily support 24" studs. However, when I purchased it, it was only 20" across.
