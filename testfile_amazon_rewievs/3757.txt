Really Like This Backpack
I'm using it on my 60 lb Border Collie. Once I figured out HOW to get it on him we were good to go. Each pocket is big enough for a bottle of water. But you do have to balance the weight on both sides or your dog might walk funny. This is extremely handy to carry all kinds of stuff. Seems really durable too.
