Lens error kills the Camera
As it has been well documented by other reviewers, this camera has a major manufacturing flaw. I first bought one for my daughter and it has worked well. But when my wife bought me the same model 3 months later, it worked all of 3 days before the fatal Lens error message. The camera won't open, the lens won't move and it is dead, not even able to view pictures. Happy I could at least remove the SD card and save the 30 pictures from it. I never tried the repair option and just returned the camera within the 30 day period. Amazon was as usual phenomenal, refunding the return within a week (including return postage) despite the purchase being from another reseller. Well done Amazon. Shame on you Canon.
