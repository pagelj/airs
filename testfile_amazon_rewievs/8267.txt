Great Video, Pain in the But to Setup
Bought this as a Baby monitor. Based on reviews and features, I thought this was a great buy for the price. However, if you plan on wasting a few hours in setup and then waste another several hours to research on setup because the instructions are terrible (I regard myself as very proficient with tech items). After setup, I was able to see my little one! Great and perfect.... but, no audio (advertised function). Tried many configurations, adjusted the software, tested this and that but no audio via PC, IOS, MAC, etc. Either these are flakey in quality control but I got a crappy one and this was my second one to replace a previouse order. In addition, I keep hearing a clicking sound, which I found out that it was the IR "switch", OK, but it clicks (loud) on and off more than it should and even during bright daylight. I keep wondering if someone else is watching... Anyways, I returned them both. So in short video good (once past 4-8hrs setup), audio non existing, and poor quality control. Glad others are enjoying theirs, you were the lucky ones to get a functional one. If you want to try your luck, go on ahead, but I'm not trying again.
