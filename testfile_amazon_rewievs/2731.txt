Too glitchy - bad inputs
Purchased this around Christmas time because I needed a blu-ray player and also for the Amazon Prime feature.  I thought Sony was a name I could trust but by March I started to lose the video signal with the HDMI cable.  Amazon said I was past the return window and Sony's only suggestion was to replace the HDMI cable, which did not work. It's now June and it's a flip of the coin whether it will work or not. At this point, it seems my only option is to replace it.  It seemed like a good deal at the time but now I'm stuck with it.  I would not recommend.
