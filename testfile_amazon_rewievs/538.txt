great!!!!
My wife loves it and I fell good now that my baby 5 month went to his room , we can hear him and the video is very clear too. the sound volume is good. the price is also amazing against others.... this camera does not move remotely , only manual , don't have some others extra features as the expensive ones, but for me its great..... 100% recommend it
