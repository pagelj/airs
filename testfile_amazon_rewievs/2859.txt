Simply doesn't last like the OEM
A bit disappointed about this one; never got more than an hour of run time out of this; we were carefully to fully charge but not over-charge; then we were sure to run it out, charge it fully, etc.  Despite our care it would never run more than an hour; usually around 50 minutes.  I would try to find an OEM battery or brand with a better reputation. Gideon
