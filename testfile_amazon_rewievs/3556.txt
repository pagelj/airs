Not What I expected!!!
My son had the same phone two years ago. We purchased it brand new, therefore I still had many of the accessories including the dock and charger. This was a plus because the charger that I received did not work.. When charging the phone I must keep inserting the charger into the connector, because this phone does not charge well. In addition, there was no SD card in the phone. I hope that theses issues are the only ones. I would have appreciated honesty from the seller.
