One of the great works
Marvelous science fiction classic by the legendary Jules Verne. Even today, the story is as fresh and thought provoking as in the era it was written. A true visionary, Jules Verne sensed the intrinsic evil of unbridled science, and the natural tendency to adopt technology for military applications, or in this adaptation, a scientist's disdain for the use of weapons for military conquests. Rich, intelligent characters are blended with vivid etchings of 18th century sea faring adventures. Most definitely a fine addition to any sci-fi buff's collection!
