Throw away
I liked the griddler despite the fact you can't clean the cooking plates well because of the so called non stick surface.  I used it often according to the coking instruction booklet that came with the appliance.  After a short time the plastic locking clips that hold the removable plates in place became brittle and broke off.  The top plate will not secure to the lid rendering the appliance useless .  This is an expensive throw away.
