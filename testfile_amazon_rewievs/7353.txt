GOOD PROTECTIVE COVER
Satistied with the quality and utility of this cover.  Easy to install Fire and use.  Recesses the power button so that the possiblily of accidentally hitting the button is reduced.  Would have given it five stars but the price is a little high based on the size of the cover.  I purchased an equivalent quality cover for an Ipad at a cheaper price.
