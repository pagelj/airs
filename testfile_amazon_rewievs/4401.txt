nice, simple, solid and light
nice tactical pen.. the groove cuts are great for grip retention. one of my requirements in an item like this is no cap... i hate having a pen cap to deal with. this one twists to open which is nice.  a recommendation if they redesign the item - have the body screw together and have a seperate twisting mechanism so that if you overturn the body when closing the pen it isn't inadvertantly unscrewing the two halves of the pen.  but it hasn't been an issue, just a observation of what could happen. the only negative i have was the blue ink it came with... i'm simply not a fan of blue ink.  but seeing that in the description, i ordered some black gel refills at the same time and they arrived together.  writes great now.
