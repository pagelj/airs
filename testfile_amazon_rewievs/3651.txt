Canon Backpack
How could you go wrong with a $30 backpack made specifically to carry digital cameras?  I use it on all my trips and it has never failed me once.  The pouches and pockets are VERY handy.  People complain about there being no protection on the top where the camera is, but like everything else, if you're careful it it will be ok.  Two thumbs up for me.
