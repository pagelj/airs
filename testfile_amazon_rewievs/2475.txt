it can not plug in iphone if you have protector case
I bought this one and it works well when I did not have iPhone4 case, but when my first iPhone dropped on the ground and face was broken, I bought a iphone case, but this cable can be be plugged firmly, the boot is two short to reach the end to the lock position. Now I have to find another cable like original cable.
