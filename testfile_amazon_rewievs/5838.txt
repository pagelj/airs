Good but not great
Though this headphone is from Sony which normally makes good products, i have to say, its not very good. After only 2 weeks of use the connector broke. Though the rest of the headphone is fine, I found that it was not well made where the connector is. To me it seems to be a design flaw. Fits well on children of most age under 12, but its design problems should be taken into account. Sound is good, and does limit output so that children ears have less chance to be damaged, something that was a plus for it.
