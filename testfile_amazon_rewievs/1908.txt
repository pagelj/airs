Very steamy "but"
Nice read but some of the writing I did not like. I love the HOT marine Logan. But I hate it when writers develop African-Americans characters as illiterate. I believe I read another book by this author and she did the same thing. The cook character could have been deleted or she really was not needed. I wonder I the author ever reads the reviews. I also hated when Logan was injured. The author should research what occurs when soldiers are injured overseas this aspect of the book was complete fiction. I gave this author another chance I think I will stop buying her books. I do not know if she is just throwing something together or she might believe reader are ignorant.
