in-expensive product that does the job
I purchased this product after going to best Buy and noticing that another mounting system for $120.00. This mount was delivered in 3-4 days even though Amazon estimated 5-6 days. The mount took some time to put together but the directions were easy. Assembly took me around 10 min. All and All for the money, this system was great.. I will purchase all of my mounts from Amazon for all of my TV's in the future.
