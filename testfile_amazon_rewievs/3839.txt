I love Wattpad!
Any genre and many books to choose from with good amateur and pro writers and all for free! It's great seeing so many willing to share their story for others to enjoy plus the willingness to get feedback. I think it's a great tool for those that want to explore the field of writing to hone their talents. I really enjoy the ability to escape into a good story anytime without worry of charge. All I need is my Kindle and/or laptop, internet, and Wattpad and I'm set. I've been a Wattpad member now for 10 months and am so glad I stumbled upon it. I don't know what life would be like without it anymore, yes I do... boring! Thank you to the creators of Wattpad, I love it!
