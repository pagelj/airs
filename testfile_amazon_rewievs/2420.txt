I Really Like This Book
I read a review that said this book was very "technical" and that almost put me off.  There was a brief part that seemed like it was going to over explain the "math" the main character does to stay alive, but it did make sense.  I think the main character is done great.  He's funny and clever.  You'll like this book too!
