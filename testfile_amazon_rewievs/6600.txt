I don't have any issues with the splashing, or not hot it's always steaming hot. My only thing is I have a habit of leaving the coffee in there and so noticing 1 of my scoopers is starting to turn brown but if that's all that I have to b replacing in the future, buts fine now but i know i read a guy said his started to rust. But mine hasn't i think its just stained but i still have the other scoop so than It's sure good to me for a long time I'm sure. I am sorry about everyone else's bad luck but I'm having great luck with mine like I said I read over 80 reviews just to make sure that this is the better deal versus the K and I have to say it is..... money wise definitely, and size wise for sure..
