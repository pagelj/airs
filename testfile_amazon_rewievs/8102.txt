Super product!
I can be pretty tough on a cell phone case and this Tech Armor screen protector is everything I hoped for and more!  My phone is in an Otter Box Defender case, but the screen protector had become badly scratched.  Before ordering a new case I thought I would try this product and I'm glad I did.  I popped the screen protector out of the Defender case, applied the Tech Armor screen protector, then placed my phone back in the case.  Voila! ... it now looks better than new!  Just follow Tech Armor's instructions and the installation is quite easy - my first try was successful.  Also, I highly recommend the anti-glare & anti-fingerprint protector.  There is no loss of touchscreen sensitivity, no loss of color or definition, and it's really great to not see fingerprints all over the screen!  Also impressive is how committed Tech Armor is to complete customer satisfaction!  I didn't need to contact them for help, but they go out of their way to let you know that help and support is available in case you need it.  Bottom line - great product, great price, fast delivery and plenty of support if needed.  Thanks, Tech Armor!
