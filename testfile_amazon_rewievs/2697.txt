iphone replacement screen and kit
The screen is a replacement screen for the I-phone 3g.  It is a very good quality screen and it came in a timely manner. The plastic tools that came with it were low grade but did work,  The rest of the kit was just fine.  NOTE look up instructions on YouTube and watch them a few times. Also when taking the screen off with the plastic tool place in between glass and silver frame.  Everyone seems to skip that part.  First time I almost ripped off the silver trim doing what I thought the video was telling me to do.  Also screws are very tiny be very careful.  You will not find it if you drop it.  Good product it works well no problems to speak of.
