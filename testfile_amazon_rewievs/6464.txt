Let me just say I threaten to bring this into work to clean all the time. This is lightweight compared to most upright vacuums. It also has strong suction! As soon as I got it, I did what the commercial touts, vacuum with your orginal cleaner, then followup with the Shark. It picked up the biggest dustball I could ever think of!  I tell this to all my friends, and anyone who ever brings up cleaning!  Get it, it's worth every penny!
