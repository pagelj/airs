This product replaces an ancient Black & Decker hand vac which had given up the ghost. I've used it now, for about a month and it seems efficient and powerful. It has a good reach. I emptied it out last night and found that I had to use an old chop stick to get the debris out since the storage chamber is oddly shaped, wrapping around the suction unit. But the waste largely did get out without problems, although some hair and the like were pesky. It stores well and is light enough to use almost everywhere. Of course I keep it plugged in, charging when not in use. All in all it seems like a good unit (to date) and a decent enough $40.00 value.
