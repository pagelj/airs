Belkin
Its a cute compact backpack that makes it easy to carry a heavy laptop. Although it has loads of pockets, there's not much space in the pocketsthere's not much space in the whole backpack really but it is lightweight and providesgood padding for my laptop. Also miss the extra pocket for a water bottle. Thought i wouldn't but i do.
