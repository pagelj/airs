was awsome but to many problems
At first I loved this game. My 5 year old daughter & I would play it together. But you have to have friends to get hearts so we made some sent the request. the request were accepted but they are not showing up. I reported it twice with no response. they only responded to another problem. and thats the thing there are other problems. it is a great game concept but gameloft does not have it running right. I will change my review if it is fixed.
