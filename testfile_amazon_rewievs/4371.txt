Heavy but sturdy, easily installed
Obligatory information: I have a 42" Panasonic Viera TV, and this rack works wonderfully for me. This is not a lightweight construction, and you don't want it to be, because the TV hanging from it is even heavier.  Presumably a more expensive rack would be made from a better material, but unless you have specific reason to doubt the construction of your walls there is no reason to nitpick over ten pounds when the TV weighs 40.  It is large enough to span the width of a widescreen but small enough to be invisible behind it, and the vertical braces were the exact right length to reach both holes on the back of the TV (it goes without saying that both holes must be screwed in to the bracket).  I really appreciated the catch-all selection of bolts packed in with it, since the TV didn't come with any.  The included level was a nice touch; now I have two.  The included HDMI cable was unexpected and you should note its presence before spending money on a separate one. Things you need to install this that are *not* included: a stud finder (I recommend the Zircon StudSenser i65, which took me a lot of comparing and considering to settle on); a power drill; a wrench or pair of gripping pliers.  The first, because it is imperative that this grip the sturdiest part of the wall, and unless you just built the wall yourself, you don't know where the studs are.  The second, because the bolts that go into the wall need guide holes.  The third, because although a flat throwaway wrench is included, it is so awkward and so painful to put force against that it is much better to turn the bolts with something built with a real grip.
