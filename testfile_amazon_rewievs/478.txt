Throw away the torpedo level
This is a remarkably well made mount for the price. Cons:The torpedo level is worthless; it showed level even though it was 15 degrees off in either direction, buy a decent one.  The instructions could be a bit clearer.  You will need some skills to mount a tv safely. The instructions assume you have wood studs.  I found out the hard way that I have metal studs. Pros:It does its job well.
