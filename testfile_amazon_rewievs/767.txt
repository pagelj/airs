Connection and operation
Difficult to connect and the help line listed only gives you a recorded message referring you to a website!  It takes 3 remote controls for me to be able to view VCR/DVD and resetting input.  The manual is vague on instruction and I've had to feel my own way.  I've not yet tried to record onto tape and can only hope it will do so.  I've had this for six weeks and have today found someone to connect and give me some instruction.
