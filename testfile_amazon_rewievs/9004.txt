This works good for what I need.  I am not a big coffee drinker.  I have maybe one cup every other day.  I have a fancy expensive coffee maker that I use when people are over.  It's not very good at making a small amount. But there is a problem with the cup, or at least the one I have.  It's a two-wall design with a hollow space between the walls.  It's not sealed properly.  When you wash it, water gets trapped beween the walls.  With that wet enclosed environment, there is probably all kind of bad stuff growing in there.  It's easy to end up drinking some of that bad stuff because the only exit point is about a half inch below the top of the cup.  When you turn it up to drink, it is at the perfect angle to poison you.  I like the cup design but I decided I better start using a regular cup. Also, it's good that you don't have to use a paper filter, however, if you use fine grind coffee some of it will pass through the filter.
