Long and entertaining - that's a good combination
A lot of people complained about the length of this book, and complained about becoming bored, and complained about a perceived lack of moving the plot forward. I did not encounter any of those issues.  I did not become bored at all while reading it. Sure it didn't have as much action and major plot twists as any of the first three, but that it not what I read books for. I found the character's adventures all interesting and the plot was advanced on several levels and in several placed - at the wall, in the North, at King's Landing, in the South, and in Mereen. And since the book was entertaining, I consider its length to be a plus, since it provided me with more hours of enjoyable reading after long days at work. Still, the book is not perfect, and therefore I took off a star. There WERE a lot of unnecessarily long descriptions of various courses at the dinner table, and I don't see why the whole story arc of the Prince of Dorn (can't even remember his name anymore) was even included - he did not do anything that had any effect at all on the rest of the story,******minor spoiler alert in the rest of this paragraph*********and then he died. Surely the dragons didn't need his inept help to escape, it sounded like they would have gotten out on their own, eventually. I will reserve judgement on the new pretender to the throne who suddenly showed up. Also, part of that star is taken away for the sheer length of time that GRR Martin made us wait for this installment. I am increasingly worried that Martin will kick the bucket before he finished the series. He's not getting any younger.
