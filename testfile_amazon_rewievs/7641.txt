I love everything about this microwave.  For a 1200 watt unit, it takes up surprisingly little space.  The design is great, it matches my stainless appliances.  The blower motor is a little loud,  but not a negative for me.  It's really lightweight, too, I was able to get it out of the box on the floor and up on the counter by myself. This was a great bargain, I'm very pleased.
