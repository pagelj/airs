Excellent camera!
Have used for about 2 months, still learning the options. Have had multiple digitals over ten years, and usually photo edit most pix. Pix from this are most always so clean, don't require any "touch-up". Only complaint: When holding camera to shoot with one hand (right), tendency to hit the flash on/auto button with thumb. Other wise, I love it.
