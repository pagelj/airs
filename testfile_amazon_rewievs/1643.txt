A pretty decent romp through England
A unique story with a likable cast of characters. Though the book was a little more of a mystery than I liked I still felt interested until the end. A little convoluted at times and dragged in some area. There were also a lot of grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors that a quick edit would really fix. I gave it 4 stars. I really enjoyed the hero.
