The garbage can is very nice looking but the lid stops working after a while. I bought the round can and the lid stopped working right around the end of 1 year. I called itouchless and they send me a replacement lid which cost as much as the garbage can with shipping, The new lid has stopped working as soon as 1 year was up. If you want to spend $50 every year for a garbage can you can buy one of these. The customer service will not help you any way .. all they want is for you to buy another product from them.
