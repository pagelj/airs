Meh
First, it came rolled by hand and had clear packing tape holding it in place. There was no label or anything. It was just a taped up ball of cord in a shipping bag. Second, it was frayed on one end, and melted on the other. So this suggests to me that there was a much larger roll and they just cut off 50' of it, coiled it up, taped it in place, threw it in a bag, and shipped it out. I had to melt the cut end myself after trimming away the frayed bits. Honestly, I would have just thrown away the label anyhow. So no big deal in not getting one, but it also looked pretty half-assed and not the sort of image I would want to put out there for my company. As for quality of the actual cord, the outer sheath (as has been previously stated) was exceptionally loose. I am sure I could slide the core completely out of it with little to no effort. The core itself is also loosely woven and not very tight at all. For 4 bucks it was not bad. It was not at all what was pictured or described but not bad. I probably would have still bought it if the the pictures and description were accurate, but keep in mind, do NOT use this for any kind of medium or heavy job.
