We bought one of these for our store, which has hardwood floors plus some mats.  My first impression of the vacuum is that I have played with higher-quality toys in my youth.  I have jokingly designed a label for it which reads, "Do not use near open flame -- appliance may melt."  The plastic is so cheap and thin, parts of it will dimple and bend permanently if you press on them too hard.  And unless it's set to the absolutely lowest setting, it will not pick up grit at all, only dust.  It is also so lightweight, the brush action grabbing the carpet will pull the thing forward, right out of your hands.  It was inexpensive, sure -- but there is a quality threshold you just shouldn't go under, and this is way under that.  It works for now, but next week?  Next month?  Craigslist, here we come.
