A fun ride!
Nothing to deep here. Weber is a master at the fairly simple yet vastly enjoyable Sci-Fi yarn. His 1st book in the Honor Harrington series is a prime example of what makes Weber such a great read. He balances characters with action very well. He has rapidly become one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors.
