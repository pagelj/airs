Much cheaper then at my carriers store!
For the price it is unbeatable. My girlfriend and I got new Galaxy S3's so this kit was perfect for us. It was very easy to install, no bubbles as long as you put it on right. The anti-glare/anti-finger print finish is really nice while your outside in the sun, but it lowers the screen quality just a little bit. Not sure what some of these reviews are saying, this fit my phone exactly, as long as you put it on right it.
