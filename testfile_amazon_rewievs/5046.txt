Not consumer friendly
This phone and it's programing is not user friendly, each time you go to use it you must UNLOCK IT. Who ever programed this phone has No idea of ease of access. Despite making numerous calls to Tracfone  there was nothing they could do about it. I now have a Samsung T404G, yes it cost more money, but it is well worth it. This only goes to show you only get what you pay for. Mike B
