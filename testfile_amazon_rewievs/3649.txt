Issue with the product and too much delayed
First of all it took more than 3 weeks to receive the product. Second - The usb cable received is kind of faulty, which gives me a message saying "USB cable drawing too much power" - there are many solutions to solve this problem, but on the first hand why is this usb cable having an issue. Had an issue with my last purchase from a different seller in amazon,its turning out every thing happens on a row.
