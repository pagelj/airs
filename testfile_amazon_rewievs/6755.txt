I chose this machine because of the ability to use both ESE pods and ground beans.  I had previously owned a restaurant quality Nespresso machine that required their capsules and didn't so much like that.  In that respect and for this price range, this was a good choice.  However, the location of the water resevoir, coming off the back right side isn't ideal for my setup.  The filter holder fits very tightly... enough so that it is hard to get it in to the right position.  The tamper that is built in to the machine will not be sufficient, but that was expected.  I wish this machine were just a little bit taller to accommodate a typical coffee cup instead of just espresso sized shot cups since I like to drink cappuccino more than espresso shots.  Overall though, this is a machine that I would recommend.
