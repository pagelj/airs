I now understand other comments regarding the product
I wrote a review of this product but stipulated the wall mount bracket and television had not been installed.  At the time, I did not think the weight of the television would cause the bracket to sag.  After the installation however, I did see what others were talking about.  Although this is not a weight issue it is a construction issue.  For some reason the television sits at a slight angle once it is installed and for the life of me I can not understand why.  I must stand by my initial write up on this product, it was a surprise when I opened the box and looked at the bracket.  The construction is sound, well machined and has points at every hinge that allows the end user to tighten in order to ensure the bracket does not swivel when is not supposed to while allowing the bracket to swing flush to the wall.  It is my wish for the manufacturer to look at this bracket and solve the riddle of why the television slants when installed.  I will follow the earlier suggestion in another post: drill the lower mounting hole about 3/16" to 1/4" to the right of the top screw hole in order to off set the inherent slant that occurs when the mounting is complete.  I would still recommend this to anyone contemplating wall mounting a television that is appropriate in size for the bracket.
