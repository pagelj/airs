laptop light
well it works it does light up my keyboard able to see all the keys. light stays in place BUT when plugged in its lose not sure if there is away to fix it so its not so lose. I like that it has a off and on switch but not sure how I will like it since my USB ports are near the front on my laptop. think my hand will keep hitting it when I'm typing. I really can't say much more that all the other reviews have not already said about this light. I think its ok light just not sure its for me for what I payed I'm not to worried if it dose not work out for me. would I buy this again NO just because I think it will be in my way when typing. now if my USB ports were near the screen then I would.
