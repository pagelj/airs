Teaching an old dog new tricks!!
This computer is a wonderful little thing.  It's just taking me a while to learn how to use it as Windows 8 is so different from the other Windows OS.  I will and it is becoming easier every day.  This little power horse is amazing, and I love the touch screen.  It's very fast and I love the instant on feature.
