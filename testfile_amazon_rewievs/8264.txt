NOT for use in salt water
Described as waterproof. Maybe in fresh water but not salt water. After 1 day on the back of a kayak, it worked very well. After 2 days, the connection was corroded and unit no longer works. Manufacturer and seller should make it clear that cap over connecting point is NOT waterproof and when used in salt water, the unit could fail. For this reason only, I rate this 2 sta1.
