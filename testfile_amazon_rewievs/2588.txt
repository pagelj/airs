Great bag for your Boyscout
This 55 liter backpack has two pockets in the hood and a useful pocket on each side. The lower mesh pockets are not very deep and I wonder if they will be of any use for kids running and throwing bags down along the trail. The hood pockets are good size and one is on each side, topside and underside, of the hood flap. The sleeping bag pocket will hold the Slumberjack Lone Pine 20 Degree Regular size (80" x 31") sleeping bag with a little room to spare. The bag has several straps to compress the load.  A tethered rain fly in its own pocket is a plus. The adjustable height should strap system means the backpack will stay with the child as he grows. I have not looked at the dual aluminum stays (back supports) or how to fit (bend) them, but the paperwork states they can be custom fit. Overall the backpack appears to be well made. Now, we need to get it out on the trail and I will let you know how it performs. I am considering the Teton 4000 or 5200 for myself.
