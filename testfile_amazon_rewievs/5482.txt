We wanted to get a 14 cup coffee maker since we drink a lot of coffee and wanted the extra capacity for when we have guests. The rating on this product was very good and the price was reasonable. The coffee tastes great and the adjustable carafe temperature is an excellent feature that eliminates the need to warm up your coffee in a microwave. In summary, I am giving this product an excellent rating for these three reasons: makes great tasting coffee, 14 cup capacity, and the adjustable temperature carafe.
