Gourmet Settings Strand 20-Piece Flatware Set
The flatware is a good heavy weight set.  The only odd thing of this set is the knifes, they are not your typical butter knife.  They are shaped differently.  I got use to them quickly, but other family members didn't.  The edge is straight instead of being arched.  It is also pointed rather than blunt.  I only used them for a few weeks and found that there was no change in the finish of the flatware. The finish is very shiny. I was happy with the set.  I would buy them again.
