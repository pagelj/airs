I love these dishwasher tabs.  This is first environmentally safe product that actually worked!  I wanted to like the others, I really did.  But with Method I don't have to try.  We have soft water and I haven't noticed the film the other reviewer mentioned.  The dishes sparkle and when the machine is running all I smell is a light clean citrus scent without the harsh chemical overtones found in conventional brands.
