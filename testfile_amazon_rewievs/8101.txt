Disrupts wireless signal - don't buy!
Yes, this is a cheap monitor, but I don't have a problem with either the video or sound quality.  Night vision works fine.  My two issues are:1. There's no battery indicator to let you know how much battery life you've got left.  It just dies when it's out of battery.  Annoying and really stupid, actually.  Really ruins the portability of the monitor.2.  It operates on the same frequency as our wireless router and therefore disrupts our wireless signal.  My husband googled the problem and found a few different solutions (so try that if you're having this problem) - now, if we have the monitor on and are trying to use one of our devices (laptop, iPad, Roku box) we're mostly ok, but streaming video is still sort of spotty, and we have to keep turning the monitor off and on.  Before my husband googled, the signal would just go in and out, making it impossible to do anything online. Don't buy this monitor if you'd like to walk around with it or if you have any wireless devices in your house.  Spend some extra money.
