Not compatible to spanish language
Called Acer, recommended a $20+ disc to convert to Spanish language; paid close to $20 to FedEx only to find out that computer itself was not compatible to switch to spanish language.  Returned everything, but still got stuck with the Fed Ex bill and all the aggravation that no one at Acer knew beforehand that it was not compatible.
