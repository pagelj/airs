Excellent accessory
I was never one much for camera cases; however, when I dropped a few bills on my new Canon S95, I thought it was time to protect my investment.  This is a perfect case.  The S95 fits inside snuggly and most importantly the camera is easy to get in and out.  The last thing you need is a case that gives you trouble and makes you miss the spur of the moment shot.  It has excellent padding for protection from drops and it also seems to be water resistant to some extent.  Both of which are great features.  This is a big change from my Olympus Tough camera that I threw about, but it was time to get a REAL camera that didn't take pictures that looked like they came from a camera phone.
