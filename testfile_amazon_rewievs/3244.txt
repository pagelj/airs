This microwave is very noisy when turned on; door is well made heavy which makes it very difficult to close, you almost have to slam it shut. It is not a good feeling each time when you have to wrestle with a microwave door to close it. Overall, so much better than the GE profile which was a joke. I've only had it for a month so let's see if my review will remain three stars of worse.  all I want is that the interior does not start peeling off like the GE profile did.
