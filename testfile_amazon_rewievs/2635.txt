Frighteningly believable
This book paints a picture of a scenario that I found chillingly believable. It's written in the current day and ties in enough to the world situation to seem like a very authentic "what if" story. The characters are well-developed and the way their lives degrade from a normal situation to desperation is exactly what I imagine would happen, and to me the technological aspects were believable.
