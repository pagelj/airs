I hate this phone!!
I hate this phone!  It's a piece of crap and doesn't do anything that I want it to do!  I can't even check my voicemail on this phone because the screen blinks on and off constantly (if it will even light up)!  I can never connect to the internet!  Not worth the money and would love to send it back for a refund!  I'm now shopping for a new phone to replace the new phone that I just bought!
