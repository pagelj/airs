The Man From Earth-from a big fan of the film
I've seen this film numerous times via Netflix streaming. It is one of the best films I've ever seen. The entire movie consists of an extended conversation between colleagues that takes place in one room. I watch it now and again, and it has never lost its original appeal to me. I highly recommend it.
