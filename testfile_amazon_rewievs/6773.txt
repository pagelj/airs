Good, but disappointing
As a long-time fan of both Pratchett and Baxter, I had high hopes for this book.  While supplies a novel world(s), interesting characters, and an exciting adventure, it lacks both the humour I've come to expect from Pratchett and an engaging storyline that both authors regularly provide. The book is a nice read but offers little more than a straightforward exploration of a new universe.
