Coolpix S8200
Camera takes very good pics.  Some focusing problems "locking on" (in the auto mode) occassionaly.  Seems the close photos are when it has most focusing issues for me.  I mean 12"-16" close or so.  Otherwise the camera is great.  The pop up flash is tricky but once you know where it pops up, you should not have a problem.
