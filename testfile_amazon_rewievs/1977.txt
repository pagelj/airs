concerns
I love my kindle fire, but recently I am having problems with charging it. I realize I am out of the 1 yr warranty and all you can do is offer discounts on a new one. And while I appreciate this offer I am wary of purchasing another one for fear I will have the same problem but it will occur conveniently after warranty has expired. I had a friend who had one for less than a year and had the same problem. Of course, hers was replaced, but I can't afford to make this kind of purchase every 2 t0 3 years. An item like this I would expect to have a longer life span. I have lots of books on my kindle and am a prime member and enjoy those benefits but will have no use for either if I can't get the kindle to charge. I do feel like this is a problem with the kindle itself and nothing I have done since it is a recurring problem. Because I value this item so much, I am very careful and take good care of it.
