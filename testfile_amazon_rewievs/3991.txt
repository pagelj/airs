Good Design but Very Poor Quality
In the first week of having this backpack, the side pocket zipper got stuck and became unusable. About two weeks later, one of the main pocket zippers became stuck and "derailed". I tried to use the other zipper, but it too would get stuck in the same place. In the process of trying to get the zipper back on track, the fabric tore where it met the zipper. The backpack has a good design and I really wanted to use it, but the quality is extremely poor. The zippers are cheap and the stitching is weak. It's not built to last even light use. I've gotten better quality "freebie" backpacks from conferences. Very disappointing.
