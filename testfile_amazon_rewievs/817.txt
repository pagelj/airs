I ordered this microwave to replace a 12 year old Panasonic that I let popcorn get too hot and the machine was scorched. It still works and after I get the smell out, I will use it in another place. This new model is great. I especially like the sensor cooking where the machine senses when the food is ready. It's also great that the food is heated evenly (middle and edges). I would recommend this product to anyone.
