I don't live in Tunisa! Cldn't change it!  WHY can't companies just get it right? Do their designers not use the product?  I would urge anyone to buy this product--EASE OF USE, ease of dumping the container, great suction for size. The turbo attachment for stairs and pet hair works great!--> I'm really only leaving this negative part HOPING SOMEONE IN THE COMPANY IS SMART ENOUGH TO READ AMAZAON REVIEWS AND WILL PASS THIS ALONG! >>  The top handle comes loose and has an accordian extension which is GREAT, EXCEPT the accordian is *much too tight* which makes it not reach far enough AND because the vac is so light, when you extend the accordian hose just 2 feet, the vac falls over on you or your furniture. It's infuriating!  Hose too short, tension too tight. W/the vac being so light, the only improvement seems to be making the hose longer, and w/easy extension so when it falls over, it doesn't hit you!  >> The accessory that holds the little brush and crevice tool is a joke--gravity pulls one of the tools off continuously.  COME ON DESIGNERS--YOU'VE GOT A GREAT PRODUCT, FIX THESE FLAWS for future owners. Let great word-of-mouth drive sales, not old owners having to buy a new & improved version!
