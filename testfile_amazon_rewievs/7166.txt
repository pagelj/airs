What a fantastic product, i use it all the time!
I got the brown color - very very nice. This is JUST what i needed. I live in the city and i can make myself a good cup of coffee just the way i like it and have it in a thermos ready when i get to work or wherever i'm going. Even at the computer table or while i work. I can slip this one in my back pants pocket. Fits cup-holders! The flip top is just great, at a push of a button the top comes up and you're ready to drink from a properly sized funnel. It has a 'safety' clip so if you toss it in your bag it won't spill. I've had it in backpacks/bags and never leaked. The only time it did leak is when I overfilled it - obviously my fault. Just pour in hot water before use to pre-warm it and it holds heat for a good long time. Pros:Small, one hand operation. Looks nice. Well designed. Does not leak. Fits cup holders in car. Cons:non really... maybe when the top flips up it can fling a drop of coffee but you get used to controlling the lid when it flips :). May be too small for some people who drink large sized drinks.
