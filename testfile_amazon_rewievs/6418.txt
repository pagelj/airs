Great JanSport backpack!
My daughter is in 2nd grade this year and its good to know that JanSport makes a light weight but yet durable backpack that will fit in her locker at school!  We had so many colors and patterns to choose from but this one was an instant wow!  Hope it lasts the whole year but it came with a lifetime warranty, so no worries!  The shipping was great, just in time for school!  The price with shipping was within my budget, so it worked out great!  Thanks :)
