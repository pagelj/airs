The Martian
I enjoyed the book and found it to be an interesting story. The only thing that kept me from a higher rating was the profanity... While I'm not against it being used when appropriate, or occasionally, I feel it was used a bit too much. Other than that, I enjoyed the story and I found it entertaining.
