What i was exactly looking for!
I wanted a matte screen protector for my new iPhone5 and I ordered this 3-pack set from Amazon. It came in a comfortable packaging from Amazon and Techarmour provides one with a dusting cloth (2"X2") good enough to clear out any dust on your phone and a credit card like thing to move out any air bubbles. There is a peel-off sticker on the whole protector sheet which needs to obviously be peeled off little by little as you stick the protector sheet on the phone. couple of points to note:1. make sure there is absolutely no dust on the phone before sticking the sheet on2. do NOT touch the sticky side of the sheet with your finger - since this is matte, it would show up on the front side3. align the sticker to the earpiece/camera/home button carefully. although I did peel off and re-stick it without any hassles, i believe doing it repeatedly would reduce the stickiness and will leave ugly finger prints. if there are any air bubbles, they can be smoothed out with the card Techarmour provides. At the end of it, the phone looks really cool with the matte finish and doesn't reflect off any light like a normal protector would. its really helpful when you go out in the sun. whats more.. you get 3 sheets in total :) good investment for a good phone
