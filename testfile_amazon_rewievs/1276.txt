AmScope 20x-40x-80x Digital Binocular Stero Microscope
This microscope is well worth the money. It comes very well packaged and also comes with a handy cover for storage. The images are clear and in focus for digital transfer to a computer. My only complaint is the instructions that come with the scope are useless for a first time microscope user. Some people might get frustrated and return the scope for this reason, and that would be a shame. The company should consider developing a simple easy to follow guide directed to first time microscope users.
