Converter worked perfectly overseas
I purchased this unit to take on a tour of Israel (200 Watts 50 hertz). I recommend checking the power available in each country you visit as they can be different (hertz - cycles per second) to insure compatibility with the equipment you are running, and the required plug for their outlets. It worked perfectly with their national electricity to power a curling iron and blow dryer from a hotel room. The only potential drawback is that to provide the higher wattage rating, it understandably uses a transformer that weights 1+ pounds adding weight to your baggage.
