Worst Camera Ever
This is by far the worst camera I ever owned. All images appear to be out of focus and underexposesd with very soft details and distorted colours. I bought it in August last year and since then I experimented with both automatic and programmed features ourdoors and indoors and regardless of what I tried the rate of success was at best at 10% or lower. For a long time I blamed it on myself and read the manaual multiple times but everything I tried yielded the same unanacceptable results.
