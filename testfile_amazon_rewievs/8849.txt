Worked one day
It worked fine the first day except for one time when the volume using a flash drive was very low but it was ok after I reinserted the flash drive.  On the second day the volume was very low, using flash drive or mp3 player, and it stayed that way even though I had recharged it.  Now I have to go to the trouble of sending it back.
