Had bad experiences with Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker. Mr. Coffee used to make a good product, but guess they couldn't leave well enough alone. Not being able to put up with our last coffee maker any longer, I read many reviews and decided to give this one a shot based on the many positive reviews here. I have to say that we are satisfied. It makes coffee. It doesn't overflow like our last two. And, the carafe doesn't dribble coffee all over. What more can you ask? Actually the only reason I didn't give it a five star rating was the same drawback pointed out by others. The placement of the fill opening is a bit small and awkward, so you do tend to dribble a little water around. Not a deal killer though.  Another very minor point is that the basket is like an inverted cone; it won't stand up on the counter, so we keep an old wide mouth cup to hold it up. I do recommend this machine highly, though
