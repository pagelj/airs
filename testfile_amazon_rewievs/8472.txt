Perfect for Amazon VOD streaming
I'll be perfectly honest and state that I bought this particular device for a very affordable way to stream Amazon VOD content. I also have the latest Apple TV (3rd generation) but after dropping Netflix, and keeping only my Amazon Prime account active, that device is not as useful as it could be.  With that said, I think the quality of video of Amazon content is better than I expected which speaks both to the device and to the Amazon service.  I have browsed and played some of the Crackle channel content as well, with similarly excellent results as far as video quality goes. That is all I expect out of a streaming device - to deliver video and do this well, given reasonable network connectivity and a solid WiFi connection. In this activity, the Roku HD truly does deliver.
