International phone in a foreign language with a foreign language manual!
I purchased this phone in good faith from Blutekusa, through Amazon.  I like the phone, but was very surprised when I opened the box, charged the phone, and then turned the phone on to find that it was in a foreign language!  I checked the manual, and it too was in a foreign language!  Luckily, I'm computer savvy enough to go online and I found an English manual in one location and directions on how to change the language on the phone to English on another.  I have now written to Bletekusa several times to just get them to acknowledge that they should have listed this information on their Amazon page, but they refuse to even admit that they've done anything wrong!  They say I purchased an "international" phone.  Well, I know I purchased an international phone!  It's not the first one I've purchased from Amazon, but it is the first time that it and the manual came in another language rather than English! As to the phone itself, it seems to be okay for the most part.  It does seem to loose its connection to my bluetooth at times, but don't know for sure that that's the phone or not.  Also, removal of widgets, which I didn't need nor want, took another trip to the internet to figure out how to remove them. Another issue, although I have the phone set up with Wifi, Kies (Samsung software for communication between PC and cellphone) doesn't seem to recognize the connection; again I don't know if this is Kies or the phone.  The connection seems to be fine with the UBS cable, just not with the wifi. One more little quirk, when the phone rings, the first ring is very quiet and then comes up to normal volume.  I wish it would ring like normal from the first ring.  But again, I don't know if this is normal for the phone or just a quirk.
