Book one...
A dystopian sci-fi novel set in Earth future where the ozone layer is ravaged. A good premise, the action is a bit slow and the story proceeds slowly. Even though there were only a few main characters, they were developed gradually. The setting is also described piecemeal throughout the book so that the reader isn't able to get a good understanding of it right away, that makes it difficult to get into. If the characters had been more deeply developed then it might have been ok, but together with everything else, it was just hard to enjoy. The novel has a lot of promise but it just didn't do it for me.
