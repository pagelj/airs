It is tough to earn five stars in the coffee maker world, but the Brew Station comes close.  However, I can see why some complain about water leaking.  Although some may have purchased lemons, following basic instructions and using common sense will avoid most spill mishaps. For instance, if you do not carefully fill the reservoir, you can spill water on the counter.  But with a little care and basic intuitive guidance, making a cup of coffee is a snap (it actually can make up to 4 six-ounce cups or one mondo 24 ounce cup).  I like not having a decanter/carafe to clean (my wife likes that, too), and that I am the only on who drinks coffee allows me to make one unobtrusive cup at a time.  I have owned and used this coffee maker every day (twice per day) for three months without a problem, and it makes a delicious, hot cup of joe every time. Update --After three months, the coffeemaker began leaking.  Being handy, I tried many fixes to remedy the leak, but all to no avail. The construction was sub-par and disposable.  Avoid this machine. New rating = 1 star.
