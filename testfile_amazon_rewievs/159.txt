So far so good.
I've only had this camera for a week or two but I like it so far. I can be a little rough with cameras and my past 2 have broke because I have dropped them. I was at a field party this weekend and seemed to do perfectly fine. I have not had a chance to use it underwater yet. There are some minor things that irritate me though. The wrist tie is located on the left side of the camera, while the shutter button is on the right. So sometimes the wrist tie will get in the way of the picture. Also, the preview button is located right next to the shutter button so if someone else is taking a picture who is not familiar, sometimes they hit that button instead of the shutter. Also, there is not an option where you can have the flash on permanently, only on auto or no flash. But I like the camera overall.
