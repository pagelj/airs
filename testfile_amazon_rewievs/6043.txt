Worthless piece of crap
I bought this camera for my wife as we both love waterproof cameras and this camera is able to go underwater a little bit, awesome.  i had previously accidentally destroyed her old waterproof camera on our trip to Maui by diving too deep with it (woops) so i thought this would be a great replacement as long as i didn't screw up again. it worked for a few months, the pictures were never a good quality.  on our trips to San Diego and San Francisco we both agreed that we would much rather use our iphones to take pictures as they actually were showing better quality. a month or two later and the camera will not turn on.  no idea why, we didn't drop it or anything.  we thought it may be the battery, but the battery works in my older fujifilm camera (not waterproof).  so thanks Olympus.  your camera blows. even before it died, i would have given it maybe 2.5 stars simply because it was working under water.  but seriously, even when it did work the picture quality was fairly poor.  though i will say that i did love the panoramic setting (though it was very difficult to hold absolutely steady if there's wind, so the pictures weren't very good there either because you have to keep it 100% level).  whatever. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA (unless it's on sale for like $15 and it's for your kid to mess around with in a pool).
