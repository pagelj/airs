Amazing
I currently have three of these and a HD antenna. We only have internet and over the air television which has been amazing. The Apple TV has worked well for me since I have iPads and iPhones which can have stuff streamed to them via Airplay. I tried a Roku but the lack of Airplay and I own many movies that are in iTunes which Roku wouldn't play.
