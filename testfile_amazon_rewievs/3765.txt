I love this thing!
This blows George Foreman out of the water. I love that it comes with both flat pans and grill pans that pop out and can be put in the dishwasher. On Sunday, I used it for all 3 meals! I opened it up flat and made pancakes on it for breakfast, then I made paninis with the grill pans for lunch. And at dinner we grilled some salmon on there. It also is fast for quesadillas. I turned it on to preheat and then got my quesadilla ingredients out of the fridge. By the time I had it assembled, it was ready and it cooked it perfectly and evenly in about 3 minutes.
