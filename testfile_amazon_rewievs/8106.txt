Who ever invented this should get a raise.
Before I got my Roku my TV was pretty much just a piece of furnutiure but now my TV is as valuable as gold. i love the idea that you can pick and choose almost anything out there. I am stll getting to know my Roku and we are truly becoming better friends. I would recommend it to anyone who has a TV.
