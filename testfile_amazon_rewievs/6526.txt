Best Battery Pack Ever!! (*UPDATED*)
=========================================================*** UPDATE (04/27/12) ***I just received an email from NewTrent. They've come out with a newer, even BETTER, version of this battery. The one I reviewed here a year ago (the iCruiser IMP1000) is 11000mAh@3.7(41Wh), with 5V/1A output, and has one USB charging port. It remains an awesome battery pack and powers every device I've owned so far... except for the new iPad 3, which requires a 2A charger. However, the new version (the iCarrier Duel Port IMP120D) is 12000mAh@3.7(41Wh), with 5V/2A output and has *two* USB charging ports (first port is 2A, second port is 1A). No other portable battery pack that *I've* seen matches that. And it's the exact same size, shape and weight as the IMP1000. The manufacturer says it'll work with just about every smart phone, ebook reader and tablet on the market, as well as a host of other devices. And yes, it works for the new iPad 3. The manufacturer says it'll even work for devices that haven't been released yet. It's brand new, so it's not available on Amazon yet, but I'm sure it will be soon.=========================================================-------Original Review-------This is one SWEET battery pack! I'm a gadget freak and mother of 5 and we have an unbelievable number of electronic handheld devices. I've always had phobias about them dying while away from the house when we need them most (especially my phone)and don't have access to an electric outlet. Well, thanks to NewTrent, all of my fears are gone forever. This awesome battery charges EVERYTHING... my iPod Touch, my cell phone, my GPS, my Sony eBook Reader (like Kindle), my DS Lite, my PSP, my kids MP3 players, my husband's Zen Vision Media Player and even his electric razor! (it charges more than that, but I only have so much space to write)It's extremely simple to use. Just plug the AC charger into battery in to charge it. Then once it's charged, plug your device into the USB port on the battery, via the included cable and tips or the device's USB cable and let the magic happen. And the capacity of this Battery Pack is ENORMOUS. I can be away for days and never need an electrical outlet! I take it with me everywhere I go. Before, when I was out running errands and my phone was dying, I could only charge it while I was driving. But if the store is only 5 minutes away, that's not enough charging time. But now, thanks to my NewTrent battery, I can take the phone with me into the grocery store and charge it while it's in my purse! Joy :-DBut you don't have to have a lot of devices to benefit from this battery pack. Just one smartphone, media device or game system alone makes it worth it. If you like to watch movies or play games on your Phone or iPod, then it's a must have. And last but not least... the build quality of this entire kit is superior. I'm extremely picky about electronics and I avoid cheap materials like the plague. Every piece in this package is high-quality, from the battery itself all the way down to the cables and tips. In fact, I much prefer NewTrent's iPod charging cable over Apple's flimsy cable. NewTrent's is much more rugged. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with electronic devices. I just wish I had this sooner, when my kids were all little and playing on their Gameboys during every car trip..
