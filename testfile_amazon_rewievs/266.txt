good unit
Good size. Even baking on bread. Broiler worked fine on garlic toast. Great job on a pork roast and scalloped potatoes. Lightweight. Touchpad has to be pushed firmly. Power cord very short. This can replace 70% of what a standard oven does. Decades old oven died and we had this new one delivered to the boondocks of N. Minnesota in 3 days.
