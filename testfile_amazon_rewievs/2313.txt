I must have missed something but it is a nice player
might be my own fault, but somehow after 2 hours with edgar at custmor support (which was a wonderful and trying rep) I got referred to a phone rep and was informed I can't connect to the internet without a router, doesn't matter that the modem is 6" away and with edgar's help we manually loaded ip's, primary, secondary and dsn info, I'm sure after I go out and hook up the router and can hear my pandora I'll be must happier, but for now GRRRRR.  My Rob zombie cd sounded awesome though.  Anyone can help me, I'd appreciate, for now I'm off to walmart for a router. Son of a biscuit!! After hooking up the router (why?) everything connected easy as pie. And to my suprise netflix looks and sounds better than from my computer. Great machine, just wish I didn't have the set backs in the beginning then I would give it 5 stars
