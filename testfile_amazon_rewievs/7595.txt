WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR
OMG I LOVE THIS CAMERA and extra lense. I don't know why I waited so long to get this. I wanted a nice camera like this forever and now I regret waiting. I have taken a ton of beautiful pictures with it and it has been worth ever penny I paid. I have not had any problems hooking it up to my Apple or my PC but then I have never had problems with Canon ever.
