Great little phone
If you're looking for a top of line or state of the art phone, keep looking.  If you're wanting to find a cheap, basic Android phone, keep looking. But if you're looking for something in between, the SIII Mini fills that space nicely.  With the same size screen as current iPhones, there it is big enough to be easy to use, but small enough to still fit nicely into a pocket.  Processing power is good enough for the apps I use, video playback, etc.  In short, this little phone will do everything for a reasonable price. My only complaint is that audio levels through the earbuds when playing video are a little low.
