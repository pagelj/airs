A cranked item that finally works! An Emergency-Kit Must!
I've owned this product for some time and it has been very useful on trips, emergency home uses, and even when needing a quick flashlight to look for something (With Tunes). It is durable because I've banged it up and it works just as it good with a BRIGHT light with an amazingly clear sound. This product is so easy that even my young nephew and niece were running this thing in about 5 minutes. The only issue I can imagine is whether or not this product is 'fully' waterproof. I've read other reviews with that issue. I will find out soon enough during my camping trip. Very happy with my purchase! Pros:+Crisp Sound+Clear light+Great reception|+Pretty damn durable+Easy usability via Buttons and placement+Surprisingly good charge and battery life (Not on Weather alert mode though)(Bonus: Can partially charge cellphones -- not iphones)Cons:- A lot of wires and no carrying case- Not fully waterproof
