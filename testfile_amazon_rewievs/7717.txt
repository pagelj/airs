Difficult to use
I bought this because it was supposed to be so easy to install and use.  I wanted to do video calls to see my grandchildren who live far away.  However I found it terribly hard to understand the instructions. None of the tutorials look like what I get when I try to use Skype, and my son does not have a Logitech "app" for his cell phone, only a Skype app.  This is my first webcam, and I almost wish I had never bought it.  If I ever get it working, that will be a miracle. There is a manual that comes with the product, but it is skimpy.  I preferred it when large manuals were included with equipment, with good pictures and descriptions.
