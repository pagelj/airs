Great little case!
I bought this case to fit a Nikon CoolPix s6000.  The adjustable strap is perfect for slinging the camera around your neck or over your shoulder and it extends to a long enough length to wear it more securely cross-body if you choose (and I'm, um, probably best described as zaftig but not obese).  The camera fits perfectly, there's a secure little inside pocket for an extra memory card and the case is hard enough to protect the camera.  I highly recommend this case!
