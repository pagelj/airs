Disappointed
I was looking forward to this being a fun read. I generally like regency farce but this was not quite what I expected. Penelope said and did things that were idiotic and strange. I did not really like her and her actions made me cringe rather than laugh. The hero was downright mean. I did find some of the secondary characters enjoyable. The Marquis was unusual and rather sweet. I also liked the Duchess and the grandfather. Obviously others have enjoyed this book but I don't plan to read others by this author.
