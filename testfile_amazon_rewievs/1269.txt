Great start to a budding Epic
A friend happened to give me a physical signed copy of this book, which is huge. They travel around going to book signings, and happened to run into this particular author, of which he is a fan. And now I am as well. Leviathan Wakes is a great book that is easy to delve into, for any sci-fi junky like myself, or a casual reader who is interested in seeing what all the hype is about, but doesn't want to be bombarded with overly technical blahblah's out there. The writing is clear, concise, and almost too simple in some cases, but makes up with a great and involving storyline, a host of characters, most whom are actually likable, and a good air of suspense, by turning this sci-fi story into a detective thriller as well. I've gone and also read Caliban's War, which was coincidentally released the week I finished Leviathan Wakes, and am eagerly anticipating the third installment in The Expanse to come out this June. For anyone who is interested in science fiction, this is a great book to wet your feet in, as you're bound to get sucked into the lovely world of sci-fi.
