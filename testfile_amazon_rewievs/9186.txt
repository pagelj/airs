Buyer Beware!  Crappy quality screen!
First off let me say the product DID NOT come with accessory kit.  It makes you wonder if other positive reviews are real or fake.  After i installed the screen, i immediately noticed a fading white of light leakage on the four edges of the screen.  After couple hours, the white became bigger and bigger.  Now 40% of the screen is completely white.  This is a crappy product and avoid at all cost. Worst part is, when i tried to put on a screen protector, with barely any pressure, the screen cracked!  Don't waste your money and buy else where.  Filling a complaint to Amazon now.
