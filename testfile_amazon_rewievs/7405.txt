Just ok
This is a predictable story and not written very well.  I liked that the main character showed her insecurities about her body... that made her a little more realistic.  Yet, the story was unoriginal and silly at times.  I mean, how realistic is it that an accounting employee gets hold of film footage which implies that her boss is having an affair.  And why/how did this employee know that she needed to see it.  I hate to have my time wasted and I felt that this book was a waste of my time.
