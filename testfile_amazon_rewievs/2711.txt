Not a traditional Pratchett, but still great.
If you're picking this up expecting a Terry Pratchett novel (Discworld or otherwise), this is not that book. But don't put the book down! Read it anyway! A wonderful piece of science fiction, and a new way to explore the idea of alternative universes, The Long Earth is well written and quite interesting. Fans of Pratchett will recognize a few things (the tree dwelling octopus!) and I think many will become fans of Stephen Baxter as well. I am looking forward to the next book!
