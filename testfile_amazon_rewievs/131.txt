Good value, some great scents and some not-so-great ones
Midnight, Sunrise, Rain Forest, Super Hit - all very good. The rest - from ok to too floral to odd. Nag Champa is ok, but not what I remember from years ago. I like a lot of incense better than this stuff now. And I prefer the quality and scent of HEM incense better.
