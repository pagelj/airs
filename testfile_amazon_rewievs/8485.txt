Good Phone, could expect more quality.
I bought this phone as an upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I had it since July 2012 and a few months ago I started to see on my top right hand corner of teh screen a purple hue. I havent dropped the phone. It's been expanding slowly to the rest of the screen. The screen works and I am able to use my phone but I wished there was better quality. Samsung phones are great, would change them but I feel thet could be made with better quality materials. I would recomend the phone but be careful with it, its extremely delicate.
