motorola droid A855
I just bought this phone  10/11/12. Phone is ok, but camera quality  for pictures taken on the inside is fair at best. Screen glare is horrible in sunlight and the phone is a bit heavy for my taste. However with that being said , I have no other problems with it and it works very well.
