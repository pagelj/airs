In the market for an inexpensive vacuum? this is it. As soon as I got it out of the box, I started vacuuming my area rugs. Wow. It picked up everything, even on an uneven surface. The area rugs sit on saltillo tile. I am truly amazed. Although the "cup" is small, i don't  care. The pleasure of having a vacuum that actually works and doesn't throw the dirt backwards is wonderful. It's truly worth the money.
