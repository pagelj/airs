Decent, not fantastic
We chose this toaster for it's smaller footprint - there are so many enormous ugly toasters on the market, and we wanted a compact version.  It basically toasts ok, (we don't toast anything fancy) can burn easily, and the supposed LED lights are a fake.  We actually returned the first one because we couldn't believe that the light was working; next one, same thing.  What looks like it should light up next to the selection button, doesn't.  It's just a number dial with a back light.  Oh well, it was inexpensive... now we'll see how long it lasts.  I had expected better from Cuisinart.
