Neat Features/Uncomfortable
I bought this with a very hopeful attitude after reading the other reviews.  Had tested a number of backpacks loaded with various weights and even gotten helpful hints on adjusting at a store.  This pack came with some nice features:  separate sleeping bag compartment, lots of compartments, decent size for class, built in rain fly, places to attach things.  However, there's a point where the shoulder pads attach to the bag that is a big uncomfortable knot in my shoulders.  Also, no matter how I adjusted for height, the pack felt like it was pulling me backward at the shoulders, not shifting weight to the hip belt.  I had to send it back and replace it with one at twice the cost. I was sad, because it's nifty for all the features.  If you're new, please make sure you get good advice and know how one should fit before you try this one on - that way, you'll be able to make a good decision.
