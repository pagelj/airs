Great mount!!
I have a VIZIO XVT3D474SV 47-Inch Full HD, it weighs about 50lbs.  This mount handled that TV with no problem.  I even hung on it a little (190lbs) and it didn't budge!  I used all 6 of the bolts they give you, and each one is rated for 130lbs+. This mount is a lot better than other mounts I've used in the past, one of the best things is the built in level!!!  That makes hanging the mount very very simple!!  Another great feature is the height adjustments, you can move your TV up and down about 10" without having to take the whole mount down, just adjust the brackets on the back of the TV! One final bonus is the extra HDMI cord that comes with this... those always come in handy! :)
