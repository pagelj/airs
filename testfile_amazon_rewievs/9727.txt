Awesome Bag- but Small
I have the Teton Scout 3400 and love that bag, the brand got my loyalty with their affordable products and great customer service and marketing. I wanted to try another bag from their "ultralight" line this year and went with this one (Summit 1500) to use as a day pack. The construction is fantastic as are the materials used. There are TONS of pockets and straps to secure gear (including two ice pick velcro straps which I think can also be used for a small hatchet or poles, if you're into that). Even as an ultralight pack, it feels sturdy. It is wicked small, though. I am 5'10"-5'11" and I had to let the shoulder straps nearly all the way out. It could probably fit someone up to 6' or so. This is a daypack though, so it's not too big of a deal as long as you know it is going to be relatively small. I might return it to try the Hiker 3700 or a larger onebut not because this pack has any problems, just because it is a bit on the small side... or maybe I'll keep this and just buy another pack to add to my lineup! Last drawback is that the side mesh pockets are insanely small. I usually use Nalgene water bottles, not a hydration pack, so some people may not care... but I was sad I couldn't use these pockets to hold my usual water bottles. They will work for keys, a knife, etc. etc. Just something to keep in mind. Even with these two minor details, go Teton, 5 stars. Edit: 2 hours laterI've stuffed the pack full and part of what I really like about this pack is that the internal frame helps you fit a lot of gear without any sag... ALSO, a Nalgene bottle WILL fit in the mesh pockets... just not super deep. But it is held secure. So, the only issue now is the size... and with a full pack it feel pretty good but in order to have it fit on my back well, the hip belt rides pretty high. Will continue to work on this but it's looking better and better.
