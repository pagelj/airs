Stylish and Functional!
I love this toaster. It is so stylish & unique. It complements my appliances perfectly. I just saw it on a design show in a kitchen makeover. Good taste designers! It toasts quickly & perfectly-dark or light. I have had no problems at all! Love the lift for the smaller pieces. Very contemporary design- much more compact than my old 4-slice toaster. I LOVE it!
