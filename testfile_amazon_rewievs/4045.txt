What the?
What is actually for sale here? Says "Retail Packaging" in the title AND says "Frustration Free" packaging in the description. Hello!? Some people are apparently getting an OEM, others are not. Amazon doesn't sell knock offs or so I thought. Is it roll the dice, guess what's behind the curtain on this one?
