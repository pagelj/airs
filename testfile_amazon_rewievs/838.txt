Strange book!
I read this book because I was suppose to be named Ramson Riggs if I was born a male.  I couldn't believe there was an author by that name.  The idea of having a home for peculiar children hidden from the world which strange powers is interesting.  I don't think I would recommend the book.  The old photographs added reality to the fiction and was a good touch.
