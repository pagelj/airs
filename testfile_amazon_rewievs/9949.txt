I bought the U5140-900 through Amazon after reading the reviews. I have been pleased that the overwhelmingly positive reviews are absolutely right - this is a wonderful vacuum cleaner, especially considering the price. The suction is very strong and catches almost everything (including my son's toys(!)). It is built very well, not flimsy or plasticky like some I have seen. Negatives: It is very loud but I can deal with it, given its efficiency. And I wish it has a retractable cord.
