Basic... does the job..... but it invades your privacy!!
I purchased this product to record my old videotapes to DVD. It works on a very basic level. Average quality transfers to DVD with very basic menu options. Even though recording to a DVD with enough time.... this would only let me record half that time to the DVD!! Additionally... it would automatically activate my webcam without my permission and also my computer would not go into stand-by mode with this software installed. Why is that??? Computer functions normally without the software installed. Not impressed. Not worth the money..... even though it's only $50. Just like the saying goes...."you get what you pay for!". Looks like a more pricey purchase for me in my future..... worth it for quality DVD's!
