DVD works fine, but VHS is sketchy...
The Pros - Super easy to hook up and the DVD side works great. Very nice picture. The Cons - VHS side isn't so great. Lots of lines through the picture that tracking doesn't take care of. The only thing that makes them go away is pulling the unit out of the entertainment center and sitting it on the floor to play - then the picture is beautiful. Not sure if it's picking up some kind of interference from the television, but things go south when it's directly underneath it.
