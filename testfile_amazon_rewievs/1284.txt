I have been pleasantly surprised by this inexpensive vacum.  It has great sucktion for its size and is very, very portable.  It is very easy to empty also.  The only down side I have found so far is the length of the power cord. I have many outlets so it has not been a problem but if you are outlet poor then you will need an extension cord. All in all for the price I don't see how you can beat this machine!***One note, this works great on tile or hardwood but does not do well at all on any type of rug.
