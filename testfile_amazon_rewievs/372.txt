Excellent Budget Phone!!!
I got the Exhibit II as a secondary phone.  This is a really very good phone for $189. Pros:- Screen size is 3.7". Not too shabby for a sub-$200 phone. It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp.- Decent specs with a single-core 1.0 GHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory.- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!!  This is what sold me on the phone - the ability to skype or video-gtalk is really nice.- Very good battery life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge. Cons:- You have to deal with a lot of T-mobile bloatware. Of course you can always root the phone and delete most of the bloatware.- T-mobile may give you a very hard time unlocking the phone as it is not purchased through them. Since I travel overseas a lot I needed my phone unlocked. I have read that some individuals have eventually gotten t-mobile to unlock their Exhibit II after several calls. I wasn't that lucky so I had to go elsewhere to unlock mine for about $25. Other:- If you are buying this phone to unlock it and use overseas, check to be sure your network is compatible- For the Exhibit II we have:2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 19003G Network HSDPA 850 / 1700 / 2100 / 1900- Several countries in Africa and Europe use 900/1800 which means this phone will only get 2g on those networks.  I found this out when I traveled overseas. :(Overall, I have no regrets with this purchase.
