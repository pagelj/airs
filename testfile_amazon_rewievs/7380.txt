Non-stop page-turning fun! SPOILERS!!
I thought this book started off really slowly. In fact, I found the first twenty or thirty pages read like lunch-time at the local cafeteria. I was reading the dialog in the early section and turned to the front to see the publication date. When I saw 2005 I was shocked-- it seemed like something written in the 1950s. This all makes sense when you realize the protagonist and his crew are geriatrics. The pace and dialog take a completely different turn when the oldsters hit their strides in their "new" bodies in the Colonial Defense Force. I absolutely LOVED the boot camp section and thought the drill sergeant was as good, if not better, than the famous character from Full Metal Jacket. My only complaint about this book? IT NEEDS TO BE LONGER! I was just getting to the obsessive-can't-stop-reading-and-go-to-bed stage and it was over! Incidentally, something about this book reminds me of the famous series by Glen Cook, The Black Company. It's more than just the fact that it is military fantasy, there is also something in the writing that reminds me of the convincing camaraderie Glen Cook conveys so well. I can't wait 'til I get my hands on the second book in this series.
