We just recently upgraded from the DCC-1200W, which lasted about 7 years before giving up the ghost.  That seemed like a good long life for a coffee maker.  Here are the pros and cons from our experience both the the DCC-1200W and our new DCC-2600:Pros:-Consistently good coffee.  Not being an expert, I think this is because the water gets hot enough during the brewing process.  Long story short, we like a strong cup of coffee and get it from the Cuisinart without using an excessive amount of grounds.-Very rarely overflows while brewing.  When it happened, it was because the carafe was not pushed all the way in.  There is a knob that allows you to interrupt the brewing process and pour a cup, and if that knob is not engaged the coffee will overflow the filter basket and make a mess.  This happened maybe twice in seven years.-Modern looks.  The 2600 is about 75% stainless steel and the rest is black plastic, which hides stains well.-Brews hot and keeps hot on the adjustable carafe heater.  A friend who had the same coffee maker wanted the coffee to be hotter, and found that using the "1-4" button on a larger sized pot of coffee did the trick. Cons:-Similarly to our old coffee maker, this will lose about 1/2 cup to the brewing process.  So if you fill the carafe to the 10 cup line, you'll get about 9.5 cups of finished coffee.-No thermal carafe option for anything bigger than a 10-cup carafe.  A thermal carafe is not only safer and uses less energy to stay warm, it is less prone to leaks - which leads to the next con:-The carafe will eventually leak around the plastic top.  This isn't a huge disadvantage but is worth mentioning.  We're talking about a few drops of coffee leaking after 7 years of daily use.  And you can always buy a replacement carafe.
