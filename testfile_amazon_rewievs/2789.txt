Disappointed
I bought this prior to going on vacation to use on the airplane. I thought the kids could watch movies.  We bought some movies before we left but were no able to view them. It seems you have to have wifi to be able to view, even though we bought them and downloaded the movies.  We went with people that had a Nook and they were able to watch their movies without connecting to the internet. I am very disappointed. This means they can't watch anything in the care either. Wish we would have bought 2 Nook's instead.
