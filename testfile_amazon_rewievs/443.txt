Product worked well first time.2nd time halfway through vacuuming does not work. Even if it is an easy fix this shouldnt be happing this soon into buying the product. Two thumbs down... Edit>>>Ended up tripping a heating sensor. Still an issue... Have a 1 bedroom apartment on a normal temp day... Should not be overheating in that time, this soon into use.
