So far so good
I just bought this case and it was a great price for me, considering a case with equal quality/size would cost me $40 at Best Buy or so. The case seems very protective. The material does not leave you worrying whether your computer will be safe when it's put in a backpack or held in your arms. Plus, it is comfortable when you're holding it! Unfortunately there isn't a handle so you're gonna have to hold it like you would a book, but that really isn't a problem. It arrived earlier than expected, so I'm happy about that too. Overall, I would recommend this :)
