Absolutely Worth the $$$
This lens is absolutely FAST! Not in a FX kind of way , but AF on this is certainly faster than my 18-55mm, 55-200mm, 55-300mm(all of them good lenses, now sold). I am not changing lenses at events anymore, and I love the fact that I was out on St. Paddys in NYC taking pictures and people thought I was a pro due to the LONG lens :P, I am not complaining. If you need a faster lens, go with the pro lenses or at least get some prime lenses. If you need an all in one lens, this is close to what I would call perfect. I have tried it in low light areas, like the NYC subway, nothing it can's handle with bumped up ISO. Sharp all around, lens has not creeped on me so far, has 2 VR settings and a 18mm Lock .. MF ring is decent. If you are considering your first DSLR, get one of the various bodies available along with this lens, you will not be disappointed. Only if this would come in 2.8 :P and a HDMI (slickdealers would know the joke :P)! This is the lens to beat.
