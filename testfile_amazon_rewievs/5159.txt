I love  this app. It is awesome. If is very fast and efficient. It makes wattpad come alive. It's very organised and  neat and also very handy for reading on the  go. It's even easier than using the  website. The clarity is awesome  and not only does it allows you to read books but It syncs  your books from your account on the website. It also notifies you when a book is updated. In simple words wattpad app= awesomeness ^_^
