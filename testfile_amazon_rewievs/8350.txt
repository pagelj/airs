My family has been actively using this trash can as our primary kitchen bin for over a month now.  Overall, I am pleased with this trash can.  There are only 2 issues that stand out as annoyances. First and most critical is that the can itself is somewhat flexible and almost flimsy.  It probably will not get punctured, but the top of the can wobbles.  To "fix" this, the can comes with a sort of plastic trim you place inside the can itself, which provides rigidity to the can as a whole.  This is also how you wrap the bags tightly in the unit.  Due to this, it is not as quick and easy as I would like to change out bags.  This plastic trim sits on top of a small ridge that goes around the circumference of the can.  It feels like one day the can will get bent to the point where this ridge will no longer support the trim, making the unit a disaster waiting to happen.  So far, this has not happened. Secondly, sometimes the lid seems to get stuck open.  I have never had this happen after *I* use it, however.  There must be something my wife is doing "incorrectly" that causes this, but she ain't telling.  I think she is using the button instead of using the motion sensor, but she denies it.  Oh well. I wish it were larger, but I knew the dimensions going in, so I can't complain much about that.
