I got this after I installed new hardwood bamboo floors in my house.  The previous hardwood floor was damaged by using a steam mop then obliterated by a leak in a wall.  Since I had learned my lesson with the steam mops I decided to look around for an alternative.  I found this.  It does great cleaning up the white silty mess that comes in from my back yard on my dogs paws.  I also use it around my litter box and it picks up any stray litter.  Using it around my parrots cages it does ok but it doesn't pick up any of the larger chunks of food.  It makes cleaning up spills a breeze. The solution smells good and does a good job.  Leaves less water then you would moping and dries out in about a minute without using the dry function.  I give it four stars because, you still need to pre-treat harder caked on messes and some times scrub them the old fashion way.
