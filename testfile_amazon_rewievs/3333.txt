Certainly NOT step-by-step......
I have read this book thoroughly and while it does give SOME information, I would have preferred there to be MORE information.  Under the picture on each page there are general suggestions on how to achieve that picture however, I would have definitely preferred information such as; "for this picture I used blah blah setting, blah blah exposure etc.," and the pros and cons of not using other settings.  The quote on the front of the book states 'The step-by-step secrets for how to make your photos look like the pros', and I have to say that that ISN'T what the book does.  There is no step-by-step anything, just vague ideas.  I gave this book three stars because of the scant information it gives but as a 'beginner' in Digital Photography with a Nikon D40 this book hasn't helped me at all.
