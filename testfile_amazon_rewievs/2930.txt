a great Nikon flash for the money
This is a great factory Nikon flash as an inexpensive upgrade over the built in one for my D3100 Nikon SLR camera.  I have used this for months now, and the tilting bulb feature is nice for indirect light for indoor portraits.  I have also used it at the Smithsonian Institute and Air and Space Museum where using this flash resulted in only need a small amount of photo software brightening to get the images up to snuff. This is a good choice for an add on flash on a budget.
