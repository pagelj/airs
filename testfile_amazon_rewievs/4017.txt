Great Looking Toaster But Not Great Toast!
I loved the slanted top of this toaster. It's large, rather tall but you wouldn't need to cover up this one.  The extra lift handles work well on short bread.  The bad news is - I toasted several pieces of Italion short thick bread.  One piece always did not toast on one side and was quite white.  When I turned up the level from about 3 1/2, it wanted to burn the other side. Looking at the wires, I can see an uneven heat or glo from some.  It just doesn't toast well. Looks like the electric wires are not heating the same on both sides. My 10 year old toaster elements were fine but it didn't have the lift handles and I was constantly trying to pick out the toast. Ouch! hot! I bought another brand locally, a Cuisinart.  Same thing, Both toasters are Made in China.  Hmmm - Wonder if we need to do some manufacturing in the USA again.
