Love My Kindle Fire!
I don't know why all the Kindle Fire has such bad reviews, I have the 2nd generation KF & I love it! Right out of the box, I charged it before I used it. It works great- charges, reads touch, downloads quickly, durable, everything I could ask for. I bought mine without the advertisements (only because I got mine at Target when they still sold them) and I have ZERO complaints. I love the book selection, even some of the free books are some of the best I've ever read. The screen quality and sound is amazing for videos, music, and apps!
