Have had this toaster for several years and have found that it has never toasted evenly on both sides. Now, the latch that holds the toast down is broken so if you want to brown your toast you have to manually hold down the lever. Took it apart and found that I needed to move a lever over but the fix only lasted a couple days. This will be the last Cuisinart toaster I will ever purchase. So why the two stars? Because I found the bagel function to work rather well.
