Extremely unsatisfactory
I applied this to an area on the back of a leather couch pillow.  It streaked Immediately and it has now been nearly 24 hours and the discoloration and streaking is still visible.  It is hard to apply evenly and the bottle says a little goes a long way.  After trying a soft cloth and a brush, I am giving up.  My leathers are not cracked, just need sprucing up.  The reviews are SO misleading.  If you are thinking of trying it, try something else.
