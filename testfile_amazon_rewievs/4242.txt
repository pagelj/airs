FAILED AFTER 8 MONTHSPanasonic NN-H765WF, 1.6cuft 1250 Watt Sensor Microwave Oven, White arrive in good time.  It performs well after three weeks of use.  The auto-select Popcorn setting is way off.  For 3.5 oz this take a full minute longer.  The fan noise is downright loud and take getting used to.  Overall; is a family size microwave and it works and has a good front panel layout.
