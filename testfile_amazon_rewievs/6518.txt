Formatting needs work
I've read Asimov's for years, and when I saw it available for the Kindle, I returned to my favorite source of short fiction.  What an appropriate setting for a science fiction magazine. I knew that in going to the digital version, I would loose the wonderful artwork that frequently graces the pages of Asimov's.  What I didn't expect was the poor formatting of the content. The text runs continuous through each edition, with no page breaks.  The end of each article has a link to take you back to the table of contents, but otherwise, one line down brings you to the next item in the magazine.  I'd appreciate page breaks at the end of each article or story -- something to bring some mental closure before being jolted immediately into the next.
