READ BEFORE BUYING
I gave this 3 stars because it is a decent phone but I am a major camera freak, the camera on this phone is awful and the flash does absolutely nothing when taking pictures. The overall phone is good and it worked great on my T-Mobile service, but I did have a problem when making phone calls. All in all the phone is fine but not necessarily worth buying. Hope this helps, any questions just ask.
