Recommend buying from apple inc.
I had purchased this item and its so terrible. If you recommend just using the USB then I would recommend purchasing this. You are basically getting what you paid for. The part to plug into the wall did not work with me on my first time use and still doesn't. So if you wish to charge your iPhone on your computer then a power source then just get this. Honestly it isn't worth buying. You should totally get one from the apple store or your local 99 cent store. There much better then amazon. Still, if you wish to try your luck then go ahead.
