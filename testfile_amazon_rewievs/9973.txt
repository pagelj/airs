Very easy installation
This is the first time I ever mount a TV and it was very easy to do.  My 47 inch TV fit perfectly on this mount.  The package included additional screws for all different TV's and an HDMI cable.  If you are looking for an affordable, easy non-swivel mount, I would highly recommend cheetah mount
