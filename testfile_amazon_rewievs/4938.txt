a excellent case
i have a 9' portable Blu-ray player and have before i brought this one i brought others that calmed to fit up to 9' but did not. this case has lots of extra room. the front pocket has space for all my accessories. the hard case is a plus. it protects against accidental droppings. would highly recommend this to any one with a portable DVD or Blu-ray player.
