The bonavita's claim to fame is both its blessing and its curse: it makes the coffee in relatively little time.  It does this by pumping lots of water, in a short period of time, into the plastic container holding the coffee grounds.  The blessing: it brews the coffee quickly.  The curse: because the hot water is flowing into the plastic container that holds the grounds at a  very high rate, the water has to move through the grounds just as quickly or the water will back up and flow over the top of the plastic container, over the machine and onto your counter top.  Because we like strong coffee in the morning, we add lots of ground; this was never a problem with coffee makers in the past; so this over-flow happens to us every time if we add enough grounds for strong coffee.  We've experimented with trying to deal with the problem.  The only way we can keep the water from flooding over the top of the plastic grounds-container is to put only four (4) cups of water into the coffee maker, or to put only enough grounds in there to brew a weak to medium coffee (the more grounds there are, the slower the hot water moves through the grounds and into the coffee pot).  Because our morning routine calls for a couple of flavorful cups of coffee, the bonavita just does not work for us.  If you can live with medium to weak coffee, a couple of things you may like about the bonavita, in addition to its making coffee really fast, are(1) it's low profile (it fits under our kitchen cabinets) and (2) the coffee is really hot and stays hot for a long time.  One thing you may not like is that the plastic grounds-container sits on top of the coffee pot (as opposed to sliding onto the coffee maker); so you must set it aside in order to screw on the lid of the coffee pot; meaning you need to keep a shallow bowl or some other container permanently on your countertoop to place this thing into.
