nice for the price
My 2 year old daughter really enjoys being able to take pictures. It is a little odd though as there are two eye holes like on binoculars... so if your child has used a regular camera before this may cause some confusion.  My daughter enjoys the image changing accents, she thinks it is a game. Very durable camera!
