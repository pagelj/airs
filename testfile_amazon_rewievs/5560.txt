Good phone if it works--mine didn't
Pros: Call quality good, thin, buttons good, although a little small for big hands, low price. Cons: Texting doesn't always work (at all), one-button shortcuts limited. Phone had better voice quality than my old Samsung, but texting never worked. Spent 2 hrs. w/very nice ATT tech, who tried everything. Popped sim card into backup phone, everything worked great, so we concluded it was the phone. Internet search found a lot of people with the same problem. So, if you buy, make sure you can return it easily, and keep a backup phone.
