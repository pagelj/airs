a bit disappointed
I was excited to find so many great reviews for this knife at such a low price. It arrived in a couple of days packed in the ubiquitous oversized plastic and a huge box. Not a very green experience. The knife performed extremely well out of the box but after a couple of days it began to dull so much that it wouldn't cut through a tomato. That is the litmus test for me. I always use a bamboo cutting board and I do not cut anything but vegetables with this knife. It was easy to regain a sharp edge with a sharpening steel but I was disappointed it dulled so quickly. Not a bad knife for the price though.
