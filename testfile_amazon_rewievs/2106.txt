First Time SLR user!
I LOVE this camera. I'm so happy with it. I know a little about SLR's but I still have a lot to learn to keep it off 'auto' and in manual. So the guide is very helpful. It takes BEAUTIFUL pictures, it's light, super fast, and it's a good fit in my hands. The 14MP is awesome- you can crop and blow up a picture without making it too grainy. The video is so-so. I love that it has that feature but I didn't buy it because of it. The focusing is loud. Live view is also cool to have- but you'll find yourself wanting to use the viewfinder because it's faster and more accurate. A great introductory price for all of it's features!
