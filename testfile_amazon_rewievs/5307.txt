So worth the money!!
This is a great product. We almost just went to a local retailer to purchase our portable DVD player because we were on vacation when our old one broke. With 2 day shipping we got the item in plenty of time. This is a much better product than what was available at the store for the same price. The swivel screen works great- it prevents my 2 year old from pushing the buttons and makes the item more compact. Great audio speakers. Would highly recommend!
