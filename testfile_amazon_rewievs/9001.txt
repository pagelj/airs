A Dance with Dragons: wiggle of worms
This series is often compared to JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings--well this installment has put that lie to rest.  First the good points, character development and world building continue to be first quality and everything I have come to expect.  Now the bad and down right ugly points.  There are so many plot lines and so many "main" characters that the story has finally been lost completely. As a result after each chapter I was left on the edge of my seat anticipating the resolution of the events only to be repeatedly disappointed when the author inexplicably chooses to switch the topic to a different character. The read was frustrating and far from the relaxing endeavor that I seek in my time with a good book. I will most likely continue to read future books in this series because I am stubborn that way, but I would NEVER recommend that anyone start this series.  I am convinced that Mr. Martin is writing for television rather than to move this series along. One can only hope that that we do not wait another 7 years for the next installment.
