Great Camera!!
This is my second Nikon camera.  The first one I had for 5 years and it worked great, so I wanted another Nikon.  The Coolpix L22 is great, especially for the price.  I'm not into photography or anything, just taking pictures on vacations, at events, holidays, etc., and I love it, small, lightweight, easy to use and excellent picture quality!  Delivery was quick and easy, came earlier than expected and at the time I purchased the camera, early October 2010, it was the cheapest around... even cheaper than Wal-Mart!
