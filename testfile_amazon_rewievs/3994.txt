My TS20 is great, but its blue color gets me as many compliments as my photos!
I love my TS20, which I bought brand new at $20 off even though it was listed under the "Refurbished" category. Apparently, Panasonic restricts Amazon from allowing non-official Panasonic product sellers to place their merchandise under the 'New' category. This camera has taken a beating so far and continues to deliver great pictures. I haven't gotten it totally underwater yet but it's gotten wet during whitewater rafting with no difficulties as a result. It may be considered trivial to some, but this camera in blue is both pretty and handsome an I get asked all the time where I got my 'blue camera.' That's actually how I came to find this TS20 in the first place after having seen one in blue in a department store. It's very outdoorsy, unlike the other 3 colors. Get one, and either wait for a sale or buy one of the 'refurbished' new units!
