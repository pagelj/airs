really good cd player
For the price paid this is a better cd player than I expected. I've been without a working cd player since my previous one crashed. Wanted a higher end model but money was a problem. For the cost this one is really pretty good. Sound quality is good but some of that obviously has to do with rest of system being of fairly high quality. Took a bit to get it hooked up right but not the fault of the player. I had the old one run thru an equalizer but I had forgotten that. The cd player appeared to be working but no sound from speakers had me scratching my head for a bit. Duh???  Finally remember to turn on the equalizer. I would consider this a pretty good player for the low price. Not sure about longevity never having had a Sony product before but so far everything works as manual states.  Not always the case with some manufacturers. Shipping was faster than expected. Always good experience with Amazon.
