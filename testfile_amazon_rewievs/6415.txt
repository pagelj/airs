Just to add to the stream of praise...
I found this on my 'pad, having bought the Kindle edition I guess because it was cheap and someone had mentioned it in passing, and then I forgot about it.  Started to read it and was instantly engrossed, and only now looking at the Amazon page again do I realize / remember that it's one of those self-published eBooks.  It's polished and professional, and well worth a whole lot more (especially for the Omnibus!). This is really good writing.  It's more psychological than hard SF; the science is certainly nothing amazing (come to think of it, the main high-tech gadget is the radio), but it's also not one of those mushy slow-moving self-indulgent psychological things.  The writing is crisp, and the plot flows at a sometimes breathtaking clip.  (Do be warned that the author does not hesitate to kill off main characters!  There are always more, equally memorable, waiting in the wings to smoothly take over.)Very, very good use of SF techniques to explore (without hitting you over the head with it) love and fear and hatred and group dynamics and the necessity of necessary evil, and all SORTS of stuff.  And just like life, at the end we haven't quite found out what's going on; but it's still eminently satisfying.
